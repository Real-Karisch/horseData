 Footnotes
 ONLY ROCK N ROLL stalked the early pace off the rail, started a three wide bid nearing the three eighths pole, took aim midway on the far turn and steadily
 improved to take over later yards. PISTOLINMYPOCKET took quick control of a clear early lead, dug in to the challenge of Fire Tigar past the five sixteenths
 pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn but was caught flattening stride later yards. JUST A LIL LUKEY stalked the pace inside,
 bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead midway on the far turn, checked then angled out at the eighth pole and finished well. FIRE
 TIGAR settled close to the early pace in the three and four paths, challenged past the half mile pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn
 then faded through the lane. TALENT QUEST came away a step slow and veered out at the break then showed little response through the backstretch.

 Footnotes
 LAUGHING CAT angled to the inside to set the pace, was steadily encouraged through the lane and just lasted. PURGATORY was shut off and checked
 sharply at the heels of Laughing Cat past the half mile pole, picked up the chase from the three path, steadily improved and just missed. FREET DEM gave
 chase from the inside, eased out leaving the turn and finished evenly. NOT A TRICK engaged in close early chase, raced at the rail rounding the turn then
 flattened stride. ACCESS TO DENIS gave chase while racing off the rail and showed little more on the turn. FATHER DON gave chase from the three and
 four paths though, never factored. A stewards inquiry resulted in the disqualification of Laughing Cat to second place for coming across the path of
 Purgatory shortly after the break.

 Footnotes
 PRIME LIME angled in and took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and rated the pace, was pressured leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the
 edge nearest the rail rounding the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. LIES AND SCANDALS became edgy in the gate then rated
 close about the three path, challenged nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep through the far turn, dropped back leaving
 the turn, came back a bit down the lane, though, flattened stride the final sixteenth. SINGINDOWNTHELANE rated close inside, bid leaving the five
 sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, drifted a bit toward the head of the lane but finished evenly to duel for third. JET SETTIN LADY saved
 ground off the early pace then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was outfinished in
 the stretch duel for third. MEEMAW'S HEART saved ground just off the early pace, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the
 three path, drifted through the turn and entered the stretch in the five path and showed little more. JAZZIE JO raced well back early on but appeared to be
 running well late.

 Footnotes
 RELENTLESS STRIKE settled off the early pace and off the rail, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, dueled close two deep rounding the far turn, raced at
 even terms through the upper stretch, took the nod mid-stretch then widened approaching the wire. BASEBALLNBOURBON stalked the early pace two
 deep then moved to the lead past the nine sixteenths pole, raced clear at the three eighths, dueled with a slim lead at the rail rounding the far turn but was
 met at even terms leaving the turn, gave up the nod mid-stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. THE IRON BANK was hustled along while angling to the
 inside, headed past the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point, angled three wide into the lane and showed little further. LIGHTNING BUZZ raced
 well off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted a bit leaving the turn and showed little more.
 JOKER MAN raced well off the pace leaving the first turn, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and had
 little left. DIE HARD DI raced five wide into the first turn, entered the backstretch well back and showed little response. STERLING GENERAL came away a
 bit rank and was slow getting into stride. BRANDED HAND was through early.

 Footnotes
 CHERUBIM settled off the early pace in the two and three paths, bid approaching the three eighths pole, closed to the front two deep nearing the head of
 the lane, raced clear past the eighth pole and held well under steady handling. TRANSFIGURED rated a short lead inside, was pressured leaving the three
 eighths pole, gave up the nod toward the head of the lane, dropped back past the eighth pole, flattened stride through the lane and just lasted for second.
 HUNTIN'THEHOLIDAYS steadied early and raced well off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled to the five path while improving steadily
 through the far turn, got up for third later yards and just missed second. SCHLOSSER came away awkwardly and settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the
 five sixteenths pole, drifted a bit on the far turn and showed little more. BRANCATO saved ground off the pace, raced at the rail on the turn and showed little
 more. BUNGALOW stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase past the three eighths pole but weakened on the far turn. Due to an equipment
 malfunction, this race was hand timed.

 EMBLEM'S ESTATE raced well off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid nearing the five sixteenths
 pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, angled out approaching the head of the lane but flattened stride later yards. Bumped outward and into Katman
