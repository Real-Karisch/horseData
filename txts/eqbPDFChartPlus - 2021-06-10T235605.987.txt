 Footnotes
 SHEZA KATHY was hustled early, set a pressured pace while saving ground, opened up a clear lead into the stretch and increased her advantage while
 being ridden out to the wire. AFFIRMATIVE JANE broke sharply despite being brushed by DERBY ROYALTY at the start, tracked between horses and
 showed good late interest. CHARMING WEEKEND was away alertly, stalked the pace while racing along the inside but lacked the needed closing
 response. DERBY ROYALTY broke in and brushed with a rival, settled three wide on the turn and showed no rally. BETDESILVERGOLD pressed the
 pacesetter from the outside and weakened late. LATIN CHARM trailed throughout.

 stretch and showed a strong late rally. REIGN ON (GB) void of early speed, angled five wide for the drive and passed a tired rival. TIZ INDY broke sharply,
