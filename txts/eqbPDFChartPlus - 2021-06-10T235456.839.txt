 Footnotes
 CAN SHE SCOOT briskly scooted to a clear lead, rated well in the two path on the turn, opened up in upper stretch, and maintained a clear advantage all
 the way to the wire under a mild drive. VALIANT LADY chased the leading pair down the backstretch and while saving ground through the turn, shifted two
 wide for a bid into the stretch, offered a mild rally two wide under a drive, proved no match for the winner but got up as best of the rest. DARLIN ROSIE
 tracked the leader, was pushed along into the turn, continued to stalk in range in the two path around the bend, came into the lane along the inside under a
 drive, could not reel the leader in, flattened out in the final furlong but narrowly salvaged the show. ZAPHICAL settled at the rear, was pushed along in the
 three to four paths around the turn, came three wide into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch, chased on but lacked the needed kick.

 Footnotes
 AFOOLER led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, turned back a challenger in upper stretch, dug in and finished gamely, just holding
 on for the win. LIZZ A BEE bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced behind the front pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
 two path, rallied on the outside down the stretch, drifting out and then back in and just missing the win. STOPSHOPPINGAMY pressed the pace entering
 the turn, moved up to challenge from the two path approaching the three eighths pole and was outkicked late. SNAKE N SHAKE raced between horses up
 the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and improved position on the rail in the stretch. STORMY EMPIRE broke erratically, making contact
 with the horses to either side of her, raced off the pace up the backstretch, entered the stretch in the four path and gained some ground in late stretch.
 DITTEN WADDY veered out leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch and around the turn while saving ground, and was never a factor.
 SCARLET POSITION bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, pressed the pace from the outside entering the turn, came off the turn in the
 four path and tired down the stretch.

 Footnotes
 DO NOT ENTER broke narrowly slowest of the field, was hustled to the lead, soon cleared, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, and won ridden out
 while never challenged. LEGENDARY LARRY tracked the leading pair, was pushed along inside of CAITLINS ROAD in the two path on the turn, came into
 the lane inside under a drive, could not reel in the leader but held a clear second under pressure. AMAROQ chased the pace in the two path through the
 turn and into the lane, rallied mildly inside horses in upper stretch, and kept on under a drive. M C SQUARED tucked in at the rear, raced in the two path at
 the rear through the turn and into the lane, shifted out in upper stretch, but shifted back in near the furlong mark and improved belatedly inside of horses.
 VBREEZE settled near the rear three wide, continued three wide in the five path on the turn, and lacked the needed rally in the lane. MAGICIAN'S BAGS
 chased between horses into the turn, continued two wide between foes in the four path on the turn, came into the lane under a drive but proved empty.
 CAITLINS ROAD tracked the lone leader on the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, was driven two wide into the stretch, but was outpaced in the
 lane.

 Footnotes
 YOURDECISIONOTMINE broke inward grazing PORTICO in the opening strides, came slowly and awkwardly into stride, settled at the rear, continued two
 wide in the rear flight down the backstretch and through the second turn, swung into the lane in the five path, found his best two to three wide in the final
 furlong and got up in time. LERO LERO stalked inside of HOUSE OF CORTEZ through the first turn, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, bid
 between horses into the second turn, vied outside of HOUSE OF CORTEZ around the bend and into the lane, wore down that foe with a furlong to go, but
 was caught in the final strides. DONIVAN MY BOY chased midfield inside of foes, was pushed along for a bid inside of MUMMY TROLL near the three
 eighths, kept on mildly two wide in the lane and got up for show late. HOUSE OF CORTEZ stalked the pace outside of FERN through the first turn, engaged
 outside that leader from the five eighths, took the lead outside that foe near the half mile mark while still racing within himself, was engaged from the outside
 by LERO LERO near the three eighths, vied gamely inside that foe, but weakened in the final furlong. MUMMY TROLL was leaning on the gate on the way
 out, chased the pace two wide, bid three wide into the second turn, raced in range two wide through the bend but lacked the needed kick in the lane.
 PORTICO reared at the start and was then grazed by YOURDECISIONNOTMINE in the opening strides, settled near the rear two wide through the first
 turn, continued near the rear down the backstretch, took closer order two to three wide in the second turn, and lacked the needed rally in the lane.
 BOYCHILD was reluctant to load, settled near the rear, continued in the two path at the inside of the rear flight through the second turn, went into the lane
 under a drive and offered no bid. FERN was placed on the lead, took pressure from HOUSE OF CORTEZ to his outside from near the five eighths, was
 headed with a half mile remaining, faded inside through the second turn and was empty in the drive.

 Footnotes
 BORDINI settled near the rear, was pushed along in the two path around the turn, began to improve in upper stretch, shifted three wide just past the furlong
 mark, rallied smartly three wide and got up in the final sixteenth of a mile. BOSTON CHARLEY broke outward lightly bumping BAJAN RHYTHM in the
 opening strides, quickly cleared to the lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn, carried a diminishing lead in upper stretch under a drive, clung
 gamely to it, but was caught in the final sixteenth of a mile by the winner to his outside. DUMBMARK tracked the pace two wide, was pushed along in the
 five path on the turn, continued midpack into upper stretch but found his best in the final furlong and gained three wide. KYZAN settled near the rear
 between horses down the backstretch, raced toward the rear inside of LETTHEBIGSHOT ROLL in the three path on the turn, and offered a belated four
 wide rally inside of that foe under a drive in the lane. LETTHEBIGSHOT ROLL settled three wide near the rear early, continued near the rear two wide in the
 four path around the turn, and offered a belated five wide rally under a drive. BAJAN RHYTHM was lightly bumped by BOSTON CHARLEY in the opening
 strides, raced keenly early, tracked the leading pair inside of DUMBMARK while racing rank into the turn, was pushed along two wide past the five
 sixteenths, bid two wide into the stretch, continued in range into the final furlong but flattened out and was swarmed by the closers. IKER hustled early but
 was outsprinted by BOSTON CHARLEY, tracked off that lone leader in the three path around the turn, went to a drive inside of BAJAN RHYTHM in upper
 stretch, kept on into the final furlong but flattened late. PALE HOSE soon trailed, raced in the three to four paths around the turn, came into the lane under a
 drive, and took mildly closer order in the lane.
