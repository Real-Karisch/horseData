 Footnotes
 BIG HOUSE bumped with EDISTO BAY at the break but shook it off, went around the first turn on the rail and held a comfortable lead, stayed at the front
 the whole way and turned for home in the three and four paths, dug in for the drive and briefly lost the lead in the stretch, fought back and prevailed.
 LYRICAL MIRACLE went around the first turn in the three path and stalked the pace, stayed at the front and turned for home in the five and six paths, vied
 for the lead and took control briefly at the quarter pole but failed to sustain that bid. THEYALLCOMEHOME went two wide around the first turn and was
 allowed to settle between horses, turned for home in the five path and hit his best stride with a sixteenth to go. JOEY CAP went around the first turn in the
 two path and was void of early speed, picked up the pace as they turned for home then swung into the stretch in the seven path, hit his best stride with a
 sixteenth to go. AWESOME ANTHONY sat well rated off the pace while in the four and five paths, rallied well between horses. HEIKO went two wide around
 the first turn while chasing the pace, turned for home in the four and five paths then weakened in the final furlong. DEACON FURR sat well rated off the
 pace while running in the two and three paths, faded with three eighths to go. UCCELLO BELLO went around the first turn in the four path and was allowed
 to settle off the pace, swung for home in the six path but had no response. EDISTO BAY bumped with BIG HOUSE at the start then shook it off, was
 allowed to settle off the pace while on the inside, was suddenly pulled up at the seven sixteenths pole then vanned off.
