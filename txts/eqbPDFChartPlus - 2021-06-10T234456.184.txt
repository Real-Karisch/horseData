 Footnotes
 EXOTIC SIN moved up to a forward position well off the inside, four wide into the lane, challenged three wide exiting the bend, took over a sixteenth out,
 enough left to last and gain the nod at the wire. APRIL MAE broke near the pace, lacked speed while saving ground through the turn, switched to the
 outside when straightened for home, finished fast to narrowly miss. SARAH'S PRAYER broke alertly, showed the way in the two and between horses,
 continued to narrowly set the pace while along the rail through the turn, proved stubborn in the drive until late, comfortably saved the show.
 SUCKERFORAGREY pressed the early pace along the rail, fell back a bit through the turn in some traffic, went evenly through the lane while continuing
 along the inside. MALLORY WILL SHINE dwelt at the start to spot the field several lengths, raced back, improved position on the outside with some belated
 interest. I CALL with the early pace between foes and in the three path, faded through the lane. BIG BAND ANNIE made little impact outside. STEAMY CRY
 forwardly placed and five wide most of the way, tired. DOUBLE ANGEL forwardly placed early, steadily retreated. FINEST KYLIE hesitated at the start, was
 never close.

 Footnotes
 RANDINSKY took over soon after the start, showed the way through the first turn along the inside, continued to set the pace while rating in the run up the
 backstretch, shrugged off a rival to be clear again through the second bend then maintained daylight through the lane while being kept to pressure. MISS
 ARDYN within striking distance while along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, slowly gaining on the winner while holding sway for the place.
 CAT WHO DAT forwardly placed past the wire the first time, fell back the middle part, moved out, rallied four wide out of the final turn, also slowly gaining in
 the late going. VOW ME OVER settled off the pace toward the inside, continued in the two path second turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a
 serious closing punch. MY BONNE MARGIE four wide through the first turn, moved closest to the winner after a quarter, pursued that rival into the far turn,
 had little left for the stretch run to lose several positions. CELTIC LASS broke near the back, moved out four wide, advanced with a middle move to within
 striking distance, flattened out. CROWN EXPRESS settled off the pace, lacked a response when called on for the drive. GATOR JACK last to leave, trailed
 throughout in showing little.

 Footnotes
 STAR ROCKET in mid pack early, advanced from between horses onto the backstretch, joined the fray with a little over a quarter remaining, dueled through
 the second turn, long drive to the wire, proved best in a determined effort. CAN'T STOP KOHEN in the second flight early along the inside, moved out late
 backstretch, roused four wide turning for home, finished willingly to gain the place while advancing on the winner in the late going. CLASSIC HIGH in mid
 pack early, steered out first turn, came five wide out of the final turn while outside the runner up, also staged a late run, missed the place. COURTNEY'S
 GIFT light bump start, pressured off the inside early, dueled inside the winner through the second turn, weakened in the final sixteenth. VOX POPULI moved
 up steadily in the run down the stretch the first time, showed the way through the first turn, briefly clear backstretch, began to weaken when headed into the
 far turn. SLEW'S SHOT void of early foot, remained back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. SCOTT'S SONG last to leave, back
 early, raced in the second flight while along the inside the middle half, moved out, tired in the late going. BIG YANKEE forwardly placed for a half, faded.
 SPRING RODEO was always outrun. JET MARSHALL broke in, lightly bumped foe, within striking distance early, was finished before a half, trailed home.

 Footnotes
 UNITAS moved up the opening quarter to vie inside, dueled into and through the stretch, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. BRISTOL ROVER
 contested the issue out of the chute outside, vied three wide into the turn, dueled through the stretch outside the winner, outfinished by that rival. ALL
 ABOUT DIVA in the second flight while in the two path, moved out in the turn, three wide into the lane, slowly getting to the top pair while continuing outside.
 MIGHTY INTIMIDATOR broke in the air, raced back early as a result and outside, five wide out of the turn, showed some belated interest to improve
 position. MASSTER CHIEF RON raced behind the leaders off the inside, lacked a closing kick. RASCAL lacked speed, moved to the inside to saved ground
 turn, improved into the lane then flattened out. TONTO M in the second group outside, four wide turn, tired in the drive. TOP CAT'S BEST BET with the
 early pace, was being asked to keep up when steadied in between the top two midway on the bend, gave way.

 Footnotes
 FLASHY IMAGE broke with the field, raced unhurried early outside, advanced with a strong outside move into contention final turn, four wide bid turning for
 home, put a head in front and drove clear. IMPISH BABE also lacked early foot, raced inside, moved out then back in midway up the backstretch, closer far
 turn, waited in traffic late in that bend, moved out three wide for the drive and finished willingly to earn the place. YANKEE EXPRESS in the second flight
 early inside, advanced and challenged in the far turn off the rail, vied into the lane between rivals, proved no match for the top pair late, comfortably saved
 the show. OVERLYAPPEALING void of early foot, in the two path onto and up the backstretch, moved back to the rail to save ground in the second bend,
 improved upper stretch then flattened out a bit late. GIFTED RICHTER went one paced throughout while racing on the inside. MISTER ANDER failed to
 menace while racing outside. MACEO ROJO sprinted clear soon after the start, showed the way for a half, gave way when headed far turn. ALEX AUTUMN
 RIVER last away, raced five wide into the first turn, was never a threat. WIREY WON four wide into and through most of the first turn, remained always
 back. D W WINGMAN was finished before a half.

 MIDGE'S MAGIC cleared to the inside into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to set all the pace far turn, remained clear in the drive
 while being kept to task. MISTY SUNRISE broke sharp, dueled early inside, allowed the winner to go after a quarter, chased that one up the backstretch
 and through the final turn, could do little with that same rival in the drive, fully extended to hold the place. SAWYERS GRAY GIRL bothered at the start,
 pulled early in traffic, moved to the inside, saved ground throughout and was gaining for the place late, game to hold the show. MY BOBBIE GIRL within
 striking distance, three wide into the lane, also closing the gap on the runner up, outfinished for the show. LITTLE DIXIE K void of early foot, improved
 position without posing a serious threat. COSTA SUGAR settled in mid pack in the three path, also came up empty for the drive. ELODY failed to menace.
 IMPAZIBLE PAT tired from early efforts. VITT BITT remained always back. TONI'S VOW was finished before a half. PER RULING DATED 2/09/2018
 RECEIVED FROM THE LOUISIANA RACING COMMISSION (RULING #22575) MIDGE'S MAGIC WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

 Footnotes
 WHISKEY TREE moved up after the start to prompt the early pace, vied between rivals into the far turn, put the other speed away in upper stretch and
 drove clear. TIZ TOWN brushed start, within striking distance inside, moved out, prompted the issue three wide up the backstretch, could do little with the
 winner in the drive, remained clear for the place. NORTH HULLEN broke on top, set the pace inside, responded when the winner came alongside the third
 quarter, could not keep up with that one in the drive nor contain the runner up, well clear of the others. UNDER AND OVER settled off the pace along the
 inside, lacked a closing kick in the drive to finish up evenly. MESETA DIABLO went one paced throughout while racing just off the inside. HEAVY ON
 THEMISTER raced off the pace and the inside, roused four wide in the second turn, failed to muster a response in the drive. WHISTLING RANGER off a bit
 slow, never a th5reat. KISS HIM TWICE was never involved. WHISPER TO CURLIN also remained always back in showing little.

 Footnotes
 ARROYO BLANCO broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, dueled into and through the turn, shook free when straightened for home, enough left to
 last. MIRACLE MASTER within striking distance, behind some traffic in the turn, tilted out to be three wide late in the bend, set down when clear for the drive
 and finished willingly to be rapidly getting to the winner. LOUGAROU pressed the winner early, moved up to duel outside that one into and through the turn,
 weakened. KISS OF THE WOLF turned in an even effort while racing three wide. D'MONEY HONEY failed to menace while racing in the two path. BAKOTA
 forwardly placed for three furlongs, backed up in the drive. FREAK NASTY FLYER trailed throughout in showing little.

 Footnotes
 FRENZY four wide when with the pace through the first turn, continued up front, floated out by a loose horse turning for home, finished comfortably in front
 of his next rival in the late going under light encouragement. KALEIGH'S DREAM moved out five wide in the first turn, middle move outside, angled in a bit
 for the drive. VELLEITY forwardly placed, three wide trip, finished up best of the rest. THIS AINT DALLAS went one paced throughout while racing well off
 the inside. LUCKY THIEF settled off the pace, well wide into the lane, no kick. NATONA LADY off slowly, raced back and off the inside, also was wide into
 the lane, failed to rally. PEE WEE DIABLO was finished early. PLEASURE AND GLORY steadily faded inside. LA ZOTA D' OROS was always outrun.
 PRINCESS GIANNA stumbled badly at the start unseating her rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START THE RESULT
 WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. FRACTIONAL AND FINAL TIMES HANDTIMED DUE TO THE LOOSE HORSE TRIPPING TIMING SENSORS.
