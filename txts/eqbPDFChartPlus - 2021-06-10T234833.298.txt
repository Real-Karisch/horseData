 SOUTHERN DUDETTE broke sharp from between foes, gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the
 second turn, remained well clear at the eighth pole and was much the best while kept to task. MINTAPPEARENCE stalked the early pace from the outside,
 advanced through the second turn, responded but could only gain the place. DYNAMITE DAUGHTERS pressed the early pace from the inside, inched
 closer entering the second turn, responded but could only hold position. PAPA'S GIRL chased the early pace outside, steadily advanced through the second
 turn, responded but was too late. WISE WOMAN forced the early pace and tired. DEVILISH SOUND chased the early pace inside and faded. HONEST N
 LUCKY was no factor. TEDDERS ANGEL was no threat. MUSKET'S CUP CAKE chased the early pace inside, was pulled up at the half mile pole and
 vanned off.

 Footnotes
 TAKE CHARGE TAYLOR unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn,
 responded when sat down for the drive and was along in time. DIAL A PRINCESS outrun early, circled rivals on the second turn, came five wide into the
 drive and closed with a rush for the place. ELIZABETH'S MUSIC broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch,
 gained a clear margin at the eighth pole but could not last. BUGGELS GIRL forced the early pace inside, dropped back, responded and rallied too late.
 UNTUTTABLE SPEED chased the early pace inside but had nothing left. SIBERIANPRODUCTION chased the early pace and tired. GALLOP'S STAR was
 no factor. ROYAL SASS was no threat. MYLIE IDEL was never close. LITTLE BROWN EYES flashed early speed and gave way.
