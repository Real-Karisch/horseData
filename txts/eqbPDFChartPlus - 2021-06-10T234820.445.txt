 Footnotes
 ZYGO away well and tracked the leader two out from the rail entering the first turn, advanced three wide soon after entering the backstretch and collared the
 pacesetter approaching the final turn, assumed command entering the turn and quickly drew clear, and was never threatened late. WE'REGOODASGOLD
 broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from along the inside in the run down the backstretch, was
 overtaken entering the final turn, and while no match for the winner, battled gamely through the final furlong to prove clearly second best. STORM CRUISER
 settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed
 four wide in the drive to get up for a share. AU CLAIR DE LUNE away alertly and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail,
 rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the stretch drive. OUR BONITA ROSE stalked the leader into the first turn
 while saving ground at the rail, tipped three wide entering the backstretch, advanced into a tracking trip in the run to the final turn, while racing two out from
 the rail, but needed more late while finishing two wide in the drive. B A HOLE AUGER broke outwards in the opening strides to get away slowly, and trailed
 the field throughout.

 HE'S THE REASON away alertly and sprinted to a clear advantage in the run to the turn, turned back a mild bid from MR. FINCH leaving the turn and drew
 clear under steady urging. MR. FINCH drove up along the rail in the run to the turn and chased the leader two wide through the turn, loomed a threat leaving
 the turn, and while no match for the winner in the drive, battled determinedly while drifting in late to prove second best. EUROPEAN broke sharply and
 chased the leader one out from the rail into the turn, closed willingly from along the rail in the drive while being forced to steady late when put in tight
 quarters. ASP was off a step slow, and chased four wide into the turn, and closed three out from the rail in the drive. SHERIFF CLARKE away well and
 chased the leader into the turn while racing two out from the rail, was unable to keep up through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive.

 COULTERBERRY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, advanced from along the inside midway down the
 backstretch to gain a tracking trip approaching the final turn, rallied one out from the rail through the turn, briefly awaited room leaving the turn before tipping
 four wide and launching his bid, to get up in the final strides. DASHING DON away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out
 from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to just miss. THE ODDS R GOOD away
 well and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, pressed the pace from the outside of OMEGA VICTORY in the run down the
 backstretch and through the final turn, took the narrowest of advantages in mid stretch, and just failed to last. OMEGA VICTORY broke sharply and raced to
 the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but was outfinished in the
 stretch drive while finishing two out from the rail. CORKY'S LUCK unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn while racing two out from the rail,
 dropped to the rail midway down the backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. BRASS AND
 GOLD settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
 needed closing response when called upon.

 run down the backstretch, assumed command entering the final turn, was collared by SOUTHERN CASANOVA entering the lane, and was unable to hold
 the place in deep stretch. PS DIAMOND CUTTER settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid
 three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive. LAGUNA BLAZE settled off the early pace while racing between rivals
 entering the first turn, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the drive. TORNIADOR away alertly and vied for the

 DISCREET COUNTRY away well and stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced her bid three wide
 entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get the better of HALLOWEEN QUEEN late. HALLOWEEN QUEEN settled off the early
 pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, advanced from along the rail midway down the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals through the
 final turn, battled into the stretch from the inside of DISCREET COUNTRY, was unable to keep tabs on that rival late, but was clearly second best.
 CATZCADIA lagged well off the early pace while racing two out from the rail into the backstretch, commenced her bid four wide entering the final turn, and
 continued to close four wide in the drive to get up for a share. DECLAYES settled off the early pacesetter while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied
 one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive. MYSTIC BELIEF lagged well off the early pace
 while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. PRETTIER
 THAN YOU away alertly and sprinted to a clear advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, was
 overtaken leaving the final turn, and stopped badly in the late stages. HOLLY HOLLYWOOD unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied along the
 inside entering the final turn, steadied along the inside when full of run entering the stretch, and finished at the rail. CATCHMEIFYOUCANT broke sharply
 and stalked the leader I the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, but began to weaken entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer
 late. MY SWEET SUGAR stalked the pacesetter into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, began to drop back in the run to the final turn, and had
 nothing to offer in the late going.

 place. NEVERABETTERCAUSE settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, commenced his bid four wide entering the final

 entering the first turn, set a pressured pace through the final turn, was unable to match strides with the winner entering the stretch, and gave way grudgingly
 from along the inside in the drive. WAILEA'S COMMAND unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the
 final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive. WISE BOSS away alertly, but was rank in the early going when taken in hand to assume a tracking trip
 two wide into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. INDY RACER tracked the dueling
 leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive.
