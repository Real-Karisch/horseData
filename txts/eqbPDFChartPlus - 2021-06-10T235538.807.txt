 late stages. LAUDERDALE stalked the pace, dueled briefly alongside GINGER SKY as they took the lead early backstretch but both were quickly passed by
 the early leader, chased three-wide on the turn, bid at the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch and gave way. DONNIE BRASCO settled off the pace, closed
 three to five-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. HANDSOME LIKE ME, off slowly, sprinted to the lead and set a reserved pace, was passed early
 backstretch but quickly regained the lead, moved clear and continued to lead the way, was engaged at the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch and gave way.

 pressured pace on the turn, was headed mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. JUST KITTEN YOU settled in mid pack, chased from the rail and two-wide
