 GILLEY TIME was rated in the two path once clear midway on the first turn then gave way late. DRIVE ON BY raced outside the winner throughout and
 finished gamely. BATTLE OF DUNKIRK ducked out sharply leaving the gate, lagged inside, swung out entering the stretch and found best stride too late.
 TOUCHDOWN BANWELL advanced two wide between horses on the first turn, remained in good position into the far turn then weakened. PAUL'S PETION
 bobbled leaving the gate, steadied along the rail entering the far turn, improved position then continued evenly late.

 Footnotes
 SWEET BABY JONES bobbled at the start but was quick into stride to go up and take the lead, hugged the rail while holding a comfortable lead the whole
 way then won driving. BROUGEVILLE was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack while running in the two path, maintained his position into the stretch
 then ran all out on the outside through the finish. CANT STOP THE RAIN went four wide around both turns while tracking the pace between horses then ran
 gamely through the stretch. CATTLE DRIVE went five wide around the first turn while chasing the pace on the outside, swung for home going three wide
 then finished gamely between horses. NOONAN ON THURSDAY went two wide around the turns while chasing the pace between horses then continued on
 in the stretch while on the rail and ran gamely. OUR BRUCE EDWIN went two and three wide around the turns while tracking the pace between horses then
 ran all out through the drive. PATTONVILLE hit the gate at the start then got squeezed back, trailed the field most of the way then had a mild rally. SPIRITS
 LEGACY dwelt in the gate then spotted the field about four lengths before coming into stride, ran towards the rear the whole way while in the two and three
 paths but lacked the needed rally. HIGHWAY RUN tracked the pace on the outside while in the three path then weakened. KOAN tracked the pace on the
 inside then stopped at the three eighths pole. HELLO'NDUBAI ran two wide around the turns while in the middle of the pack, had no response and was
 eased.

 SOUTHERN TOUCH was reluctant to load but broke very well, went up to stalk the pace and went two or three wide around both turns, made a bid for the
 lead at the quarter pole then drew off with ease while under a drive. DIVINE KITTEN trailed the field, went very wide while entering the stretch and was able
 to swoop past a tiring field. PHOTO GALLERY sat well rated off the pace while going two and three wide around the turn then lacked a rally. FREUDLAND
 skipped clear right away but was collared at the half, kept up the pace but folded up with a quarter mile to go. BLEU MOON TYPHOON tracked the pace on
 the inside, swung very wide into the stretch then faded. HIBERNIA PRINCESS stalked the pace between while going two wide but was through after half a
 mile. VANITY PROJECT hit the gate then was rushed up and tried to go through a hole that did not exist at the seven eighths pole, had to be taken up then
 ran rank the whole way, vied briefly on the outside at the half but quickly faded.

 Footnotes
 I CAME TO PARTY stalked the pace on the inside, vied for the lead on the outside at the three sixteenths pole then edged clear with a furlong to go.
 VENTURA HIGHWAY broke through the gate while loading but reloaded without a bother, broke well then sat well rated off the pace while on the inside until
 the final furlong where he rallied well when asked for more. COLORADO GRANDSLAM bumped with BOWMAN'S BEAST at the start then set a pressured
 pace while on the inside, began to extend his lead at the top of the stretch then flexed when faced with a new challenge at the three sixteenths pole, dug in
 gamely but was outfinished. BOWMAN'S BEAST bumped with COLORADO GRANDSLAM at the start but quickly recovered, stalked the pace between
 horses going two and three wide around the turn but lacked a rally. A SIXTIES TUNE was awkward coming into stride, went four wide around the first turn
 while sitting well rated off the pace, turned for home going two wide then finished evenly. SUPER FUND chased the pace while going two wide around the
 turns then came up empty at the quarter pole. BOLD AGAIN bobbled at the start then went up to stalk the pace on the outside, went three and four wide
 around the turns then stopped with a quarter mile to go.
