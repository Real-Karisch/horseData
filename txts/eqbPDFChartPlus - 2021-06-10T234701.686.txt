 Footnotes
 GOLDEN CHARIOT saved ground, advanced on the far turn, was angled off the rail entering the stretch and edged clear under steady pressure. LADY BAY
 squeezed at the start, was settled three wide, lodged a bid on the far turn, loomed a threat and hung. GETTIUP AND GO outrun early, moved three wide
 into the stretch and finished with some late energy. ALLEYES ON WILMA was outpaced while three wide and stayed on in the stretch. ENDLESS BLOOM
 never menaced. ACEITUNA led early, was headed leaving the far turn and gave way. RANBIR forced the pace and weakened.
