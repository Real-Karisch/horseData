 Footnotes
 MAJORDOMO was hustled from the gate to gain a clear lead shortly after the start, set all of the pace from just off the rail, responded in the lane and edged
 away driving. DUKE OF EDDIE stalked from the three path into the stretch but lacked the needed response. ONE MEAN PEPPER settled, raced three wide
 to the stretch and failed to rally. TAILORED saved ground to no avail. REMEMBER LUCKY was well placed inside but did not threaten. I DREAM OF
 BUGSY was pulled up once on the turn and was vanned off.

 Footnotes
 REDNECK CRAZY gained a favorable striking position in the early going, moved closer three wide on the turn, forged to the front in the upper stretch,
 edged clear briefly while drifting out and had enough in reserve to hold. JEN'S JOURNEY tracked the pace two wide, was outrun by the winner into the lane
 but kept to his task and was gaining late. THE REAL MCCANN settled early, raced three wide on the turn and failed to rally. ASSETS INCLUDED set the
 pace from the inside but came up empty in the lane. HINT TO WIN was allowed to settle, raced two wide on the turn then did not respond.

 PASSION FOR PAPA was not asked for speed early, set out after the leaders three wide once on the turn, rallied steadily to wear down Holy Plan late and
 won driving. KAJA was unhurried early, came two wide on he turn and rallied too late. HOLY PLAN dueled two from the outset, took command and edged
 clear in the upper stretch but shortened stride. OURPRINCESSMELANIE saved ground to no avail. CANDY PINK had speed from the rail to dispute the
 lead to the head of the lane and gave out. SASSY ROSE was never a factor.

 was always well place, took command three wide in the stretch but was collared late. GEE STREET settled from the rail, eased two wide on the second turn
 but lacked the needed response. VARSOVIENNE dueled two wide to the stretch and gave way. IRISH STREETSINGER unhurried early, failed to rally while
 three wide on the second turn. C C ROCKS set the pace from the inside but had nothing left after six furlongs.

 SPARKLE SHINE was permitted to settle early while well within striking distance and three wide, remained out on the second turn and rallied into the stretch
 to gain command then was fully extended to hold. PRINCESS LEIA set the pace from off the rail, was headed by the winner in the upper stretch but kept to
 her task and was coming back slowly. NAMORITA raced unhurried, was two wide on both turns and finished in a mild rally. FAST BID (IRE) trailed early
 three wide, then went even in the late stages two wide. GILDED pressed the place from three path and weakened once in the stretch. LADIESABLAZIN
 flashed speed from the inside and gave out.

 STREETLIGHTROMANCE took back early and raced under patient handling until mid way on the second turn, offered a nice rally three wide into the stretch
 to gain command a furlong out and held off CHRISTINA'S SONG late. CHRISTIANA'S SONG lagged early from the rail, angled out to follow the winner into
 the stretch and closed full of run but too late. SILVER MINX settled, raced two wide to the stretch but did not rally. ANGEL ELLA chased the pace two wide
 but had no response once called upon. PEAKED pulled her way to a long lead, but stopped after six furlongs.

 Footnotes
 HARVEST A STORM raced up inside CASTLE after the start and battled that rival throughout, was headed at the furlong pole but proved slightly best in a
 hotly contested stretch battle. CASTLE dueled outside the winner from the outset, led a furlong out but could not quite hold. STELLAR SEA settled early,
 raced two wide on the turn and rallied inside. FAIR ADVANTAGE lagged early, came three wide to the stretch and closed too late. THORNY WEATHER
 stalked three wide then lacked a closing response. JUNIOR GILLIAM was unhurried early and failed to rally while three wide into the lane. SMOKE AND
 BURN saved ground to no avail. FRENCHY BOBCAT was well place inside to the stretch and faded.
