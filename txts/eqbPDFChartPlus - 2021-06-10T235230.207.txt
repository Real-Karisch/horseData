 Footnotes
 SIR VRONSKI was chasing the leader to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but responded when set down and closed steadily to prevail.
 MIDNIGHT DESTINY had no speed, was two then three wide to the stretch, swung out widest for the drive and closed willingly but too late. STELLAR SEA
 got outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then was also finishing well. AALSMEER broke clean then was angled in but was not clear of
 HYPNATIQUE, forced that one to take up, sped to a clear lead to the turn, saved ground and responded to mid stretch then was tiring late. HYPNATIQUE
 was crowded by AALSMEET and forced to steady in the early stages, chased three wide to the stretch but finished evenly late. The stewards conducted an
 inquiry in the early stages of the race and disqualified AALSMEER from fourth to fifth for interference to HYPNATIQUE.

 CYLINDERS was on the pace from the outset while inside, responded to urging into the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch and brushed ONTONOME then
 drifted out again in the final sixteenth carrying ONTONOME out again and got the nod. ONTONOME attended the pace to the half, was two wide to the
 stretch, drew alongside CYLINDERS into the stretch, was brushed in upper stretch then battled gamely, got brushed and carried out in the final sixteenth
 and just missed. AUSTRIA was allowed to settle, rallied three wide on the second turn, swung out widest for the drive, finished steadily but was outkicked.
 SUNSET CITY tracked the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. CELESTIAL MUSIC was a factor for five
 furlongs, stopped then was eased in the stretch and walked off. Following a steward's inquiry into the stretch run, CYLINDERS was disqualified from first
 and placed second for interfering with ONTONOME.

 MY FRIEND EMMA sped to the front, set the pace to the stretch, responded when set down, drifted out in the final sixteenth and just held on. PERCY'S
 BLUFF chased the winner two wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task, rallied late, was carried out in the final sixteenth and lost a
 heartbreaker. ANYPORTINASTORM also chased the winner three wide to the stretch then finished in a mild rally. PURE COMEDY had no speed, raced
 three wide to the stretch and closed the gap late. OUTSIDE NASHVILLE was outsprinted, shifted off the rail mid turn then closed ground but too late. MORE
 POWER TO HIM had no speed and was not a threat. STREET MOXIE chased to the turn but tired in the drive. The jockey on PERCY'S BLUFF lodged an
 objection against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch but it was not allowed in a majority decision of the stewards.

 BELLA LUMA was settled to the second turn, got fanned four wide but rallied to the front in mid stretch and held under steady urging. HAL'S BUDDY had no
 speed and trailed for six furlongs, was three wide then swung out widest for the drive and finished willingly. LADY NINJA was chasing to the half, raced
 three wide to the stretch, rallied to loom a threat in mid stretch but was tiring late. PLEASE DO was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the half, had to
 circle five wide to the stretch and made a mild late bid. RAGAZZA DI VOLA settled mid pack to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was also
 making up ground belatedly. SHEEZA SASSY GIRL raced unhurried for a half mile, got pushed out four wide on the second turn and lacked a closing
 response. CHRISTIANA'S SONG had no speed and was not a factor. ROBIN'S LOVE sped clear, widened to the half, was two wide to the stretch and tired.
 TIZ MY LOVE was chasing early, made a run inside on the second turn but tired in the drive. STREET SWEETS chased the leader for five furlongs then
 gave way.

 Footnotes
 AIGLE was quick early and contested the pace to the backstretch, pressed two wide to the second turn, was along to take the lead when LORD RAYLEIGH
 lugged out to the stretch, responded when set down and held stubbornly. LORD RAYLEIGH contested the pace early then inched away on the backstretch,
 lugged out five wide on the second turn, was caught by the winner but battled on late to save second. ENGLISH INVESTOR had no speed, settled to the
 second turn, raced three wide then swung out into the stretch, responded when roused and made a late surge. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD was outrun for a half
 mile, got fanned four wide to the stretch then closed willingly but too late. IMALOCOMOTIVE tracked the pace early then was chasing to the second turn,
 raced three wide to the stretch but weakened in the the final furlong. BEAT THE CHALK had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was four wide to the
 stretch and did not threaten. SHOT OF A LIFETIME chased the leaders early then was outrun on the backstretch, raced three wide to the stretch but gave
 way in the drive. WILL GET LUCKY settled mid pack to the second turn then saved ground but gave way in the stretch. HONK had no speed and was not a
 factor.
