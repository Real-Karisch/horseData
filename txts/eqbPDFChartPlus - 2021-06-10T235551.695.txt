 SMOKER hustled up from get-go and forced the quick pace racing outside of LEAKY CUP, under all out drive at quarter pole but found more in reserve,
 kicked back in gamely and finished going away. LEAKY CUP held slim lead out of the gate and set quick pace under pressure from SMOKER, continued
 with the advantage still unleashed at quarter pole, given cue turning for home but SMOKER kicked back in gamely, could not move on with rival while clear
 for second best. FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS raced in close range in opening quarter then weakened off quick trio, kept on under steady urging and gained
 share. RAYO MY KING was forwardly placed racing three path through backstretch, came under a ride in the turn but failed to advance then steadily
 weakened. JOE DI BAGGIO raced in range off the top trio, urged four wide through the turn then came up empty in stretch. SMOOTH AS raced in the back,
 hustled up into upper stretch but failed to gain threatening position.

 Footnotes
 RED CRESCENT rated through early stages, commenced steady advance and dueled for lead inside of AEQUOR at quarter pole, turned for home with the
 advantage, shifted wider and kept clear. EYE OF A JEDI stalked five wide through backstretch, hustled up three to four wide in final turn, drifted wider in
 stretch and continued steady bid. AEQUOR led the way out of the chute then set the pace to final turn, challenged when eventual winner roused forward
 along inside in the turn, dueled at quarter pole then gave way in stretch. GUY CABALLERO rated three wide through backstretch then driving in far turn,
 raced in range then weakened in stretch. BABY I'M PERFECT tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch then came under a ride, raced in striking
 range mid-way through the far turn then failed to sustain bid. MILLIONAIRE RUNNER raced in the back, under a ride along inside entering stretch but failed
 to respond. INHIBITION saved ground through early stages, angled out and dropped back.
