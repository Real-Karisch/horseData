 Footnotes
 KING OF ALL MEDIA saved ground on the first turn, was reserved under a tight hold, moved closer midway down the backstretch, raced inside on the far
 turn, was asked while moving to the two path at the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, found room into the final furlong and closed
 determinedly to get up late. METHUSELAH rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was coaxed along in the two path on the far turn,
 swung five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed well to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole but was denied by his stablemate while able to
 hold the place. CANDY CARLOS was well placed on the inside, drafted behind the leaders on the far turn, was asked while moving to the two path into the
 stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, was headed outside the sixteenth-pole, steadied between horses while dropping back some late and was
 outfinished while just able to get the show. KIT CHECK rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear on the outside, raced three then four
 wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and improved position. JAX HERITAGE went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off
 the pace, rounded the far turn in the three path, was roused while six wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and was out-kicked. PATH OF
 DAVID saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path, shifted five wide into the stretch, angled further
 out near the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. WOLFEL BEAR set the pace on the inside, was asked after turning into the stretch, lost the lead at the
 three-sixteenths and gave way. COOL AMBITION raced inside on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and was
 no factor. SMORGASBORD was eager under stout restraint in the three path on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path
 on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and faded. (Rail at 25 Feet)

 Footnotes
 OUTBACK JACK showed good speed, set the pace, dictated terms while near the inside on the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper
 stretch and drew off under steady urging. CALEB HAWK chased the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the two to three path and safely secured
 the place while no match for the winner. IL EST VITE was ridden along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed
 response while best of the rest. GOOD ENOUGH SAID showed speed then chased the pace, raced inside on the turn and tired. TOOTH hit the outside of
 the gate at the start then bumped with a rival, was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to rally. PHIL UP DA BANK settled
 well off the pace, was urged along while inside on the turn and failed to threaten. UNK'S RED MAN was urged along off the pace, lugged out leaving the
 backstretch and was taken up, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. IDOL MCARTNEYVALUE bumped twice with a foe after the start,
 went four wide on the turn and never reached contention. FINAL DEED was urged along in the front half of the field, went four wide on the turn, spun five
 wide into the stretch and came up empty. VICKS FIRST PICK bumped twice with an opponent after the start, went four wide on the turn and showed little.
 SO NILSSON bumped with a rival at the start, dropped back while hard ridden, went around the turn in the three path and failed to respond. ROBERT E.
 LEE chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded.
