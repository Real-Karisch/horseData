 in three path through stretch. VINNIE VAN GO raced off early pace, urged four wide late turn then raced wider in stretch but lacked needed response for
 impact. CAJUN EMBERS lacked speed racing five wide through backstretch and had no response.

 response and kicked clear. HERECITYKITTY rated off clear top two leaders in early stages, picked up pace entering far turn then shifted out past quarter
 pole, raced wide into stretch and continued steady bid. FOR REEF'S SAKE unhurried, saved ground then shifted out near quarter pole, wide into stretch
 and prevailed for a share. DUBAIAN raced five wide entering first turn then raced off the pace, made bid in the far turn, took closer order then drifted in near
 quarter pole then raced evenly through lane. TOTAL TREASURE bumped with rival just after start then steadied nearing first turn, raced in the back then
 made bid entering top stretch and improved position. PIKES PEAK OR BUST was unhurried, hustled up three wide at quarter pole, gained position upper

 STAR SWEPT settled nicely being rated through backstretch, made four wide move near quarter pole then set down for drive, responded, kicked by and
 kept clear. UNLIMITED DATA broke outward awkwardly at start, raced off the pace and saved ground near inside, took closer order then roused five wide
 into top stretch and produced solid finish. GET THE NEWS lunged at start then steadied early backstretch, stalked the pace then hustled up racing three
 wide at quarter pole, dueled for lead, shook free to brief advantage then gave way. BLUESKY KITTEN bumped bit at start, rated in range, advanced in close
 contention along rail at quarter pole, waited briefly turning for home, urged three wide upper stretch then evened out. JEEKER JOE quickly cleared on top
 and angled inside, set the pace and held on top through final turn, dueled turning for home then weakened in final furlong. SUMMER BEACH bumped back
 and checked at the start, under firm restraint while rank entering first turn, unhurried, urged along outside in stretch and failed to gain threatening range.
 ROYAL FAMILY raced midpack through early stages, hustled up along rail in far turn, cut the corner then faded. BOROUGH BOY floated out in first turn,
 stalked the leader through backstretch then failed to sustain bid late far turn. INDY RULES bumped at the start, raced in the back and failed to rally.

 Footnotes
 RAVEN dueled for lead out of the gate with R SEA SMOKE, shook free to brief lead then back under attack from HARTS N FLOWERS, battled back gamely
 from inside position, gained the advantage and held firm. HARTS N FLOWERS tracked top two leaders in opening quarter then made bid up to challenge
 RAVEN, dug in along outside but could not get by stubborn foe, finished clearly second best. WAIKIKI stumbled awkwardly then slammed into at start,
 recovered quick and gamely, in steady pursuit through turn, kept under firm left handed pressure upper stretch and gained share. R SEA SMOKE dueled for
 lead out of the gate, could not kick on with eventual winner leaving backstretch then steadily faded. CHICLE SPARKS broke in and bumped with rival at
 start, showed brief interest then dropped back. DUDE'S PRINCESS lacked speed and steadily faltered.
