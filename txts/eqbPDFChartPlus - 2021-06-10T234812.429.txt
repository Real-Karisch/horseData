 four path in the stretch but couldn't close. VYERA stalked the pace in the two path but failed to menace. PROMISSORY NOTE dueled inside to the stretch.
 MY FIRST GAL was off awkwardly, then raced evenly outside. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL raced evenly in the three path. VISION'S REWARD stalked the pace
 in the four path, then faded in the drive. DISTORTED SUNRAYS and WOW WOW NOW were not factors. BLUES CORNER saved ground to no avail.

 AIN'T MISBEHAVIN dueled outside of a rival, then drew off late under strong urging. PRIMARILY GOLD dueled inside, then was no match late. CASH
 MONEY ALWAYS stalked the pace in the two path, drifted to the four path in the stretch, then had no bid. SWORD OF DAVID stalked the pace in the three
 path, then faded in the drive. BOXER BOY raced evenly. PERFECT SAINT saved ground to no avail. SUPREME COMMANDER and CARVE was not a
 factor.
