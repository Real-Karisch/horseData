 Footnotes
 SUNNY DAZE unhurried while saving ground along the rail into the stretch, shifted outside the leader before the furlong marker, responded with a burst of
 speed when set down, made the lead late and drew off under a brisk hand ride. QUIET ELITE made the lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep
 stretch then was no match for the winner. LIL EGYPT prompted the pace two wide into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. JETTIN PEGASUS
 raced widest early and failed to menace. AWESOME PALACE chased the pace three wide into the turn then folded. HONEY TWISTS dropped back, was
 never close and swung wide.

 Footnotes
 RAGS TO ROSES never far back while in the five path down the backstretch, angled in on the turn, responded with a burst of speed in the two path through
 mid stretch, made the lead at the sixteenth pole and drew clear under left handed urging. FOREST GEM pressed the pace three wide for three furlongs,
 made the lead on the turn, opened a clear lead in the four path before the quarter pole, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner.
 PLENTY QUICK pressed the pace along the rail into the turn, shifted out to the four path entering the stretch, then weakened. MIDNIGHT CUTE passed
 tiring rivals. BRAZILIAN PRINCESS failed to menace. SHELTOWEE'S GAL was no threat. FLYING EMERALD had brief speed. DREAMY EYES made the
 lead soon after the start, set the pace two wide for three furlongs then flattened out. CLEAR MY HISTORY was outrun.
