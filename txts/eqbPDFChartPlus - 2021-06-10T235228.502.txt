 Footnotes
 FOOLS GOLD broke out at the start bumping MO FLASH, chased in range of the leader five wide down the backstretch until tucked to the two path half a
 mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, rallied up the inside at the quarter pole to issue a challenge straightened away for home, took over
 command near the three-sixteenths, drew clear under a drive kept to task. MAD DOG MATTERS established the front and showed the way in hand three
 then two wide coming under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home under threat to the inside, got headed nearing the
 three-sixteenths, proved no match for the top one through to the finish while keeping on clear for the place honors. MO FLASH bumped at the start by
 FOOLS GOLD who broke outwards, chased six then five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered five wide at the head of the stretch, weakened
 while along for the show honors. CADEAU DE PAIX stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground, raced inside early before tipping out to the three or four
 path six and a half furlongs from home, chased three wide coming under coaxing three furlongs out, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened
 in the drive. GO five then four wide in pursuit, raced between foes through the turn under encouragement from midway, went four wide at the quarter pole,
 tired in the stretch. RAMBLIN' MA'AM eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the four path half a mile from home growing detached from
 the main body of the field, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths out, continued to lose ground, made no impact and was eased through the stretch.

 Footnotes
 MISTER HAYES established control before departing the homestretch, was rated along throwing down fractions on the soft side, with CHARMING INDY in
 attendance out in the two path, at times latched on and at other times not so, saw that opponent range up during the run around the far turn, with a
 revved-up MARRIAGE FEVER likewise arriving on the scene, himself positioned in path three, got set down for the drive home, engaged in what turned out
 to be a stretch-long duel with the second place finisher, was never headed digging in gamely to prevail. CHARMING INDY got set up in the two path after an
 uneventful getaway, was held in reserve stalking the winner, steadily chopped away at the deficit after exiting the backstretch, vied with vigour outside
 MISTER HAYES the length of the stretch but was never able to claim the lead. SWIVEL unhurried in the two path, came four wide into the stretch, became
 entrapped behind the heels of another soon afterwards, checked prior to altering course back towards the inside for clearance, got outfinished and had to
 settle for the show. COTTON TOWN failed to rally off a ground-saving journey. NOMINAL DOLLARS three wide on both turns, gave way. MARRIAGE
 FEVER had the pilot grab hold after losing its footing at the break, was primararily three wide on both turns, was under a hard drive scurrying into contention
 from top of the second bend to the five-sixteenths pole, wasn't able to sustain the move and backed away.

 SMILE BIG established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from FELINI to the outside, came under coaxing in the
 two path three furlongs out, got headed for command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home shaken off a bit, dug in under a drive to shying
 a bit from a near sided stick and making light contact with FELINI inside the eighth pole, came on again through the final furlong and just got the nod gamely
 on the wire. FELINI prompted the aforementioned foe two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command at the
 five-sixteenths, shook away briefly swinging four wide for home, dug in under a drive getting bumped very lightly inside the eighth pole, fought head to head
 through to the finish and was nailed at the end. SHE'S SO FINE brushed the off side stall at the start, chased just off the inside under a ride from three
 furlongs out, spun three wide at the quarter pole, kept on for the show honors. TRUTH IN THE LIES fell to her face at the start conceding about four lengths
 to the front, recovered to chase two to three wide from the tail of the compact field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
 stretch, offered up a bid to the eighth pole, couldn't sustain the move flattening out in the late stages. FLICK OF AN EYE chased three to four wide under a
 ride from midway on the turn, continued four wide for home, weakened in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 ST. PATRICK FROST brushed in the shadow of the starting gate, responded to a light hand ride to join up with SALTY SLEW soon afterwards, went at it
 side by side with the aforementioned rival before inching away on the backstretch, resisted an attempt by the pilot to get planted along the inside route,
 shook free of the competition in a steadfast manner on the turn travelling two wide, was almost at the three-sixteenths marker before asked for more, held a
 dwindling advantage in the final stages but stayed in the clear. DOOLEY made contact with CRASH MOUNTAIN right after the start, cut over towards the
 inside, spun into the stretch having been set to a full drive, flashed strong late energy in the final sixteenth en route to securing second. CATCH A CAB two
 to three wide on the turn, lacked the necessary stretch response. BIG AUK in range towards the inside, faltered. SALTY SLEW disputed the pace with the
 winner during the initial stages, went on to take up the chase from the three path on the turn, completed six furlongs and backed away. CRASH MOUNTAIN
 brushed from both sides after being sprung from the gate, saved ground for nearly three-quarters, was worked out into path six during the initial portion of
 the stretch, made no gain. TAMMANY GIANT strung out four wide on the turn, gave way.

 under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, improved position to procure the show honors. ARCHIE bumped between foes at
 the start who each broke his way, came under hustling and chased inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing
 from the seven-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. THE ORPHAN MIRACLE six paths off the inside down the
 backstretch, came under coaxing half a mile from home tucked four wide into the turn, spun three wide at the quarter pole and made no impact. BUNYAAN

 Footnotes
 INCUBATOR lightly bumped at the break, went on to attain the top, showed the way from the two path, facing only mild pressure for most of the opening
 three-quarters, got set out for the drive home, felt the presence of the runner up inside the sixteenth pole, continued along under a hard drive, making it to
 the wire just in time. CURLIN'S NEW MOON stalked the winner from the two path, was cued up angling to the outside at the five-sixteenths marker, closed
 in readily in the final sixteenth, but missed. WHYAMISOLUCKY got squeezed shortly after the field had been released, went on to take up the chase from
 the two path, was under encouragement swinging four wide into upper stretch, straightened away and rallied well enough to take the show. MY PIRATE
 pursued the front runners from the three path, kept at it before backing away in the last eighth. A LOTTA WINE one of four bumping into each other early on
 the chute, sat forwardly placed along the rail for six furlongs and faltered. PRAGMATIST mashed from between rivals a few jumps into the contest, got
 steadied, was slow to settle into stride, was guided over to the rail, flashed some interest for the first time at the midway point on the turn, fanned out into
 path five from upper to midstretch, mustered up a mild response although having made no impact. REIGN CHARGER out a bit, got corrected and steered
 away from the winner but not before some light contact, shifted to the left enough afterwards to become a participant in a four-way bumping incident in short
 order, getting momentarily knocked sideways, was three wide stepping onto the turn and under a ride leaving it from path four, gave way.

 DARING PROSPECT established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled, cut the corner into upper stretch, got roused a
 furlong from home and drew clear under a drive to prevail. CAIRENN broke out at the start bumping PRAY FOR BOURBON in concert with HAY FIELD who
 broke inwards, chased three then four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered four wide at the quarter pole, proved no match for the top one
 while closing ground to just get up and secure the place honors. PRAY FOR BOURBON got bumped solidly between foes who each broke her way at the
 start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home advancing into contention at the head of the stretch,
 dug in under a drive proving no match for the top rival, then weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. HAY FIELD broke in a step at the
 start bumping with PRAY FOR BOURBON then got bumped back due to pressure from CAIRENN breaking outwards, chased along the inside coming
 under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and stayed on the same pace to be along for the last major share.
 LIPSTICKONMYCOLLAR broke out at the start bumping SAND CITY lightly, raced forwardly placed just off the inside, came under a ride seven-sixteenths
 from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. SAND CITY bumped lightly at the start by the aforementioned foe, showed brief speed three
 wide down the backstretch before beginning to back away into the turn, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, angled five then four
 wide into upper stretch straightened away and tired.

 MISSLE BOMB out-broke the field and retained a narrow advantage, cut over to the inside, showed the way being pressed by MINERALOGY out in path
 two, was almost at the three-sixteenths marker before switched over to stronger handling, staved off a stiff challenge from THE CARETAKER and edged
 away. THE CARETAKER took up the chase from the two path, between opponents for much of the journey on the bend, got driven four wide into the lane,
 bid with determination but was staved off. SIDE TRACKS tracked the front runners from the pocket, got angled into the three path with under an eighth
 remaining and went on to secure the show. QUAI VOLTAIRE abandoned the inside route for the three path as the first fraction was being finalized, made it
 into the the stretch then wandered seven wide rallying mildly. MINERALOGY pressed the issue from the two path, keen and pulling on the bit during the
 opening phases, kept at it, that is prompting the winner, for just over a half before giving way. GEHRIG a forward factor stationed out in path three, tired.
 INCORPORATE three wide at the top of the turn, had no response. CHECK THIS OUT saved ground and faltered. LIGHTNING BUZZ three to four wide on
 the turn, fanned out into path six during the initial portion of the stretch, had no offering.
