 Footnotes
 ARBITRATOR stalked racing at mid track, roused near the three eighths pole, came three wide taking aim on COMMANDER'S CASTLE in upper stretch,
 slowly wore down that foe and edged clear late under strong urging. COMMANDER'S CASTLE sent hard from the gate, cleared into the first turn, held a
 clear lead throughout traveling in the two path, was challenged in deep stretch and would yield grudgingly while easily second best. MALIBU TIDE laid up
 close from the start, began to chase near the quarter pole, lacked rally holding onto third place. SLICK MAN settled towards the rear, hard ridden coming
 five to six wide in upper stretch, failed to factor beating others. GREAT PLAN lagged behind throughout, raced along the rail trailing the field, showed little.
 JAILBREAK settled in the second flight, faded near the quarter pole finishing well beaten.

 TIZ BEAUTY stalked the pace while saving ground to upper stretch surging along the rail late getting up gamely. TOO COOL unhurried early rallied on the
 far turn bidding three deep down the lane missing in a game try. LIBERTY FIRE prompted the pace through the backside shaking clear on the far turn,
 hooked between horses late would be outfinished. SEAMSTRESS tracked the early pace then faded from contention on the far turn. TZI OUR DESTINY set
 the early pace then wilted on the far turn.

 Footnotes
 LAST CONFESSION stalked BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN down the backside, set down mid turn, came four wide entering the stretch, drew even inside the
 eighth pole, inched clear nearing the wire for a hard fought victory. BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN led traveling a bit off the rail, headed by LAST CONFESSION
 mid stretch, matched strides to the wire but was out nodded just missing in a solid effort but was clearly second best. SUN BROWN settled towards the rear,
 responded moving into third place turning for home, chased top pair in the lane but never menaced while besting the rest. SCATTERED CASH unhurried
 trailing to the fart turn, went by weary foes in mid stretch improving placing but never factored. TUBA tracked running along the inside, roused to no avail, no
 threat. BOOTSCUTENBOGE varied little traveling towards the rear, no threat. JOYEUX stalked to the half, urged mid turn giving chase, gave way turning
 for home finishing spent.

 Footnotes
 VINAKA settled in the second flight, rushed bid leaving the far turn, dueled abreast a pair of rivals mid turn, battled with MAJESTIC GIRL to the sixteenth
 pole, drew clear late under strong handling. MAJESTIC GIRL hustled from the gate, set a pressured pace throughout, dueled with the winner to deep
 stretch, ceded stubbornly holding second place in a game effort. ARCTIC TRIUMPH lacked early foot, gained momentum coming six wide top of the stretch,
 gained belatedly picking up third place. POLAR'S GRACE trailed to the quarter pole, showed some late interest improving position from mid stretch but was
 no real threat. ERDELYI dueled in a three way battle to the quarter pole running between foes, was all done and gave way in mid stretch, used up. GERRY
 LYNN angled to the rail shortly after the start, loomed to the quarter pole, had no rally and tired in the drive. MAXIMA NEVER LATE raced mid track in the
 second flight, weakened to trail in upper stretch, no factor.

 Footnotes
 MOONSPELL pressed the pace wresting the lead on the turn edging clear in upper stretch holding firm in the four path. STORMIN GREELEY chased the
 pace while saving ground rallying near the rail late to salvage place. FLYING AROUND slow early lost ground to upper stretch gaining modestly at mid
 track. BATTLE DRUM went evenly through the turn, brushed by KATE'S FOREST near the eighth pole would gain a bit in the three path. STEREO IN
 MOTION slow early raced eight wide to upper stretch. MAGICAL CONNECTION pressed the pace from between horses through the turn then wore out the
 final eighth. KATE'S FOREST sent hard was a step slow through the turn, came in brushing with BATTLE DRUM outside the eighth pole, had nothing left
 late. WAYWARD BAPTIST away alertly pressed the pace along the inside through the turn then gave way in upper stretch. CHAMPION KID folded up on
 the turn. An objection from the trainer of KATE'S FOREST against the riders of BATTLE DRUM and FLYING AROUND for interference in upper stretch was
 dismissed by the stewards.

 Footnotes
 HARLAN'S HOWLING sat off a quartet of duelers around the turn, angled five wide entering the stretch, dueled abreast from upper stretch, slowly edged
 clear in the final furlong holding safe. EL DISCRETO pressed from the start, vied mid turn, dropped off a bit turning for home, came again deep stretch
 securing second place in a hard effort. BOOKMAKER rushed early, battled for the lead running between rivals, began to weaken in deep stretch but
 managed to save third place in a good try. JOE'S KEEPER made a slight bobble after the start but quickly recovered, rallied five wide in upper stretch,
 loomed at the eighth pole but needed a bit more missing a minor award. BEAR'S CONDUCTOR was away a step slow, settled in the second flight, bid
 belatedly in a willing manner. CELTIC MOON dueled in a four way battle running between, began to tire inside the eighth pole from earlier efforts proving no
 late menace. BULLZABOY lacked early foot, angled out seven wide under a drive top of the stretch, failed to threaten. INDIAN COMPANION settled in the
 second flight, roused to no avail, failed to respond. FAMOUS FIGHTER raced mid track throughout towards the rear, showed little. JOY OF BAPTISTRY
 battled for the lead to the quarter pole, gave way in mid stretch, used up.

 Footnotes
 APPEALING ROCKET away alertly set a pressured pace through the far turn, edged clear in upper stretch then drifted out eight wide holding firm at the
 end. GOOD PLAY prompted the pace dueling on the far turn, ceded to rival in upper stretch extending late on the inside to save place. RUOTE slow early
 gave a mild rally on the far turn bidding evenly the final eighth in the four path. KID CREED a step slow to upper stretch mustered a mild response to pass
 tired ones. JUST JIM was jammed and forced to check the break, raced evenly to the far turn then tired in upper stretch. GIANT RED was never involved.
 PADRE was always outrun. MOEGAN AVENUE bore in jamming rivals at the break, chased through the backside then gave way on the far turn. SITO'S
 BOY was jammed as the rider lost his irons at the break, eased after a half jogged to the wire walking off after the race. A stewards inquiry into the start
 resulted in no changes.
