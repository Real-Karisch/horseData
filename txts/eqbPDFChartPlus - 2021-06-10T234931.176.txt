 J J'S DREAMING cut the pace from the two path under pressure to the outside by the runner up, widened away as a pair from the rest through the turn
 coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and rebuffed the challenge to inch away in the late stages
 and prevail. GIVETHEMAN A CIGAR prompted the aforementioned foe from the three path widening away in tandem from the rest as a tandem, came
 under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive but was ultimately repelled while safe for the place honors.
 BATTLE OF SARATOGA chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and offered up a
 mild kick for the show honors. CRASH MOUNTAIN chased three then two wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on the
 turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. ROMAN WARRIOR four then three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
 through the turn, went three wide at the head of the stretch and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 CLOWNEY four wide through the opening bend, chased five wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the far turn advancing under coaxing
 from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, came in slightly under an off sided stick, bobbled over the starting gate marks attempting to
 hop over them when they drew attention by not being snow covered and bumped with UNBRIDLED DADDY a furlong out, dug in under a drive to take
 command seventy yards from home showing good courage to inch away late to victory. CONQUEST BIGLUCK E three wide through the first turn, raced
 four wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper
 stretch, got shaken off briefly a furlong out pausing as the aforementioned foe crossed safely in front, then ran on to secure the place honors in the final
 jumps. UNBRIDLED DADDY attended the early leader from the two path before advancing to knock heads in hand with that rival down the backstretch
 trading the front until that foe began to back away with half a mile remaining, showed the way through the turn under growing threat from a pair to the
 outside and was put to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was bumped a furlong out as the
 appropriately named CLOWNEY hopped over the gate tracks, dug in but was caught late and forced to settle for the show honors. HOLY WEEK two to
 three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide from near the rear coming under coaxing half a mile from home, swung out seven wide into upper
 stretch and offered up a mild kick. CODY'S NOTES saved ground near the rear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper
 stretch and weakened in the drive. KERRY BOY established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under attendance but little pressure
 early on until into the backstretch, knocked heads with UNBRIDLED DADDY trading the front until headed for good half a mile from home when put to
 urging, faded through the far turn coaxed along, went three wide at the quarter pole and was eased through the stretch. CHARMING INDY fell to his face at
 the start stumbling badly and lost the rider as a result. There was a pair of Stewards' Inquiries focusing on CHARMING INDY at the start and the incident
 involving CLOWNEY in the stretch run before the result stood and the race was declared official.
