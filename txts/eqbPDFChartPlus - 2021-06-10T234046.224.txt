 Footnotes
 GAL UP GAL settled in the early going, angled in and saved ground to the stretch, rallied next to the fence and outkicked GRACEE HUNNY in the late
 stages. GRACEE HUNNY stalked outside the top pair, angled wide into the stretch, closed gamely but was outfinished by the winner. LADY BERLIN dueled
 from the outside, floated out around the turn, gained command into the stretch but faltered late. TUSCAN SUN dueled from the inside, drifted out around the
 turn and weakened in the lane. GLENDAS GRACE bumped leaving the gate, saved ground around the turn and never rallied. JACQ'S CAT angled in and
 traveled near the inside, lugged out into the lane and never rallied. SLEW KEYTY raced off the rail, lugged out into the stretch and proved no menace.
 CHAOTIC BEHAVIOR broke awkwardly and bumped rival at the start, drifted out around the turn and never threatened.

 Footnotes
 BLAZINGHOTPROSPECT dueled outside of EVENING AGAIN to the lane, dug in late and inched away late. EVENING AGAIN dueled from the inside,
 battled down the stretch, outfinished by the winner but proved a game second. SWISS PEAK stalked off the rail, three wide into the stretch, finished willingly
 but could not threaten the top pair. EBONY CAT tracked the pace down the backstretch, moved up alongside rival into the turn, forced out by rival around
 the bend and never rallied in the lane. SIBERIAN OLYMPIAD chased from the inside, lugged out around the turn, continued along the inside to the stretch
 and could not rally, then vanned off following the race. BELLA ANGELINA showed no early speed, angled out on the turn and was never a factor.
