 BRANCATO stalked the pace on the outside and bid leaving the three-eighths pole, put a nose ahead past the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in
 the five path, dropped back a bit past the quarter pole but drew to near even terms past the eighth pole, then dueled down the upper stretch and came up
 first past the sixteenth pole. HARASAN rated the pace inside, was caught past the five-sixteenths pole and rounded both turns on the rail, took the lead back
 past the quarter pole then was met at near even terms past the eighth pole and dueled through the upper stretch but was caught past the sixteenth pole and
 settled for second. CROSSING BORDERS broke a step slow and settled well off the pace inside, eased out leaving the first turn and bid nearing the
 three-eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, eased to the outside near the three-sixteenths pole and entered the head of the lane in the eleven
 path, then rallied down the lane on the outside and was quickly closing on the runner up. LIKEITLIKETHAT stalked the pace two wide between horses and
 bid leaving the three-eighths pole, rounded the turn in the three path, then leveled off in the stretch. CHARITABLE MARK, saving ground through the first
 turn, settled off the pace inside, made no bid and rounded the far turn in the three path, then flattened out in the lane. MYSTICAL PRINCE (BRZ) broke a
 step slow then angled to the rail through the front stretch and settled well back on the inside, and showed little. TERO was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 CARTER'S RUN raced clear while angling in and rated the pace, was allowed a little more rein to edge away from Ides De Marzo and maintain the edge
 over the rallying Stock Broker past the seven sixteenths pole, increased the advantage incrementally and proved much the best to win handily. STOCK
 BROKER settled off the pace, rallied to contention leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back at the three eighths but held on for second. MINI BOLT
 saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and was outfinished for second the final
 sixteenth. DOCTOR LEO J raced off the pace about the four path the opening turn then saved some ground the second turn, bid nearing the three eighths
 pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths then lugged in while flattening stride. ROAD TO DUBAI raced off the pace about the three path the first
 turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out in the upper stretch but showed little further. IDES DE MARZO
 became hesitant in the post parade, stalked the pace two deep then faded after three quarters of a mile. YOU'RE DONE SON settled off the pace in the five
 path the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch then showed little response. KEONI was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 WORKTAB stalked the pace two deep while between horses, took the nod approaching the seven sixteenths pole, was pressured for more past the five
 sixteenths, contested a slim advantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn, battled determinedly to fend off Clutch Catch through the lane and held on to
 best the quickly approaching Fort Burton. FORT BURTON stalked the pace about the three path, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, dug in
 down the lane to take second in the final strides, finished well and was gaining on the winner. CLUTCH CATCH raced four wide the opening turn and settled
 close into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms two deep midway on the far turn and stayed on gamely through the lane.
 WINDSOR'S DEANE raced seven wide the opening turn and settled off the pace toward mid track entering the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
 pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened stride down the lane. PLEASANTLY ROYAL raced well back saving early ground, improved his position
 in the six and seven paths of the far turn but had little left. STROLLANOTHERTIME raced six wide the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch,
 bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed little further. POLISHED SOUND rated a slim lead inside, was headed
 approaching the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back toward the three eighths and faded after a half mile. EXPLOITATION rounded the opening turn five
 wide and was through early.

 Footnotes
 NO SIR REE BOB was bumped at the start by Silver Taurus and settled well off the pace on the outside, bid at the five-sixteenths pole, took over mid-turn in
 the five path and drew off, then drove down the lane mostly under an aggressive hand ride and was much the best. GREAT ROAD broke out and bumped
 Fire Tigar at the start and settled well back on the inside, moved to the outside leaving the first turn, bid near the three-eighths pole and steadily improved
 through the turn in the seven path, then gained down the lane, passing rivals, but leveled off toward the wire. AFFIX chased the pace in about the three
 path, bid approaching the five-sixteenths pole, put a head in front near the quarter pole but was caught midway through the turn in the three path, and
 leveled off in the stretch. FIRE TIGAR broke in and bumped Great Road at the start and hustled up, angling in, to rate a pressured pace inside, was caught
 approaching the half pole, then dropped back through the turn on the rail and finished evenly. SILVER TAURUS broke in and bumped No Sir Ree Bob at the
 start and pressured the pace on the outside, took over approaching the half pole, was urged at the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear just past that point, was
 caught near the quarter pole and angled in to round the turn on the rail, but weakened in the stretch. APPEALING GROOM angled in through the front
 stretch and settled well off the pace inside, but showed little. WATSON was through early. PICKLES N GIN refused at the gate.

 Footnotes
 BUFF'S EYE VIEW raced well off the pace about the five path the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, circled rivals six wide on the far
 turn, drifted wider into the lane but continued in steady fashion to get up later yards and was drawing away under the wire. KITE SURFER raced with the
 pace two deep through the front stretch then stalked the pace into the first turn, took aim three wide at the three eighths pole, contested at a close
 disadvantage off the rail rounding the far turn, reached even terms in later yards and was good enough for second. Carried out into the first turn, RUCKER
 angled in from the heels of Lass Moment and stalked the pace, challenged at the three eighths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail rounding the
 far turn and drew clear midway through the turn but was caught in later yards and flattened stride approaching the wire. HE'S A GOLD DIGGER saved
 ground well off the pace the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, closed to a boxed in position past the mid point
 of the far turn and had little left in the stretch. ASTRO RIDER raced well off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and settled outside into the
 backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead in the five path of the far turn then weakened. OWL RUN raced with the pace
 inside through the front stretch then rated clear through the opening turn, was pressured at the three eighths pole, headed approaching the five sixteenths
 then dropped back past the quarter and weakened from the head of the lane. Close three wide through the front stretch, LASS MOMENT bore out into the
 first turn then corrected course and settled close into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole but faded in the three path of the far turn.
 ROCKAROUND saved ground off the pace and was through early.

 FOR THE CROWN settled off the pace inside, took the first turn on the rail, bid past the five-sixteenths pole and eased out to round the far turn in the five
 path, then drew to near even terms leaving the turn and dueled down the lane on the outside to take the nod at the wire. DEMAY'S CASTLE settled off the
 pace toward the inside, bid near the quarter pole in the three path, then split horses past the eighth pole and enjoyed a slim, brief lead in later yards but
 ceded the lead by a nose at the wire. RESPECTED stalked the pace on the outside and bid at the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead mid-turn in the three
 path, was met at near even terms leaving the turn, then dueled down the lane and just missed second. CAMERON STREET settled well back on the
 outside, bid leaving the three-eighths pole, started the far turn in the five path then saved ground through the turn, and finished evenly. DAIQUIRI settled off
 the pace on the outside, made a mild bid near the five-sixteenths pole and took the turn in the five path, then leveled off in the stretch. JUNA broke a step
 slow and showed little. GOLDEN DESIRE was never a factor. EAGLES ZONE rated the pace inside, rounded both turns on the rail, was urged past the
 five-sixteenths pole but was caught mid-turn and faded in the lane.

 Footnotes
 BOSTON TRICK angled in to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on
 well. BEAR SQUARED angled in and settled off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and took over second
 inside the sixteenth pole. TRUE DETERMINATION raced well off the pace and settled toward the outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the five
 sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and was along to take third the final yards. LINEA VERDE raced off the pace about the three path,
 started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and had little left. TOTO'S DARLING stalked the pace two deep, bid approaching
