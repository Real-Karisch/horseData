 Footnotes
 BAND OF THIEVES hustled out to set a clear pace into the turn, was under pressure into the turn, maintained a short lead with an eighth to go, was headed
 soon after then battled back gamely, cleared and won going away. RUSTIC JUSTICE was bumped at the start, chased the pace into the turn, moved up to
 press the winner into the lane, bid when straightened, gained a narrow advantage inside the eighth pole then weakened late. SHATTERPROOF was
 unhurried into the lane while saving ground then offered a belated gain to be clear for the show spot. I TWEET chased the pace near the rail through the
 turn and into the lane then lacked a closing bid. PLEASANT SUNRISE was never a threat while saving ground into the lane. GRANDSON SLAM was never
 a factor while in the two path through the turn. SIX PACK HAYDEN was bumped hard at the start, raced in the three path through the turn and made no
 impact. PASS THE RUSH chased the pace from the three path through the turn and was empty in the lane.

 KITTEN FOR GRANNY was unhurried was near the inside, was roused in mid-turn, came into the lane from the three path when closing in on the winner,
 gained the lead near the sixteenth pole, cleared briefly and lasted. BRO STROLL trailed for half while in the three path into the turn, came into the lane from
 the five path and finished with good energy to be closing in late. HOOSIER PRIZE raced in mid-pack into the turn while in the two path, shifted out in
 mid-turn to avoid a pulling up rival, continued in the three path through the latter turn, angled into the six path into the lane and finished willingly. REGAL
 JUSTICE was in the two or three path through the turn and into the lane and offered a mild gain. KENTUCKY SHINE was squeezed at the start, hustled up
 to press the pace into the far turn, inherited the lead when pacesetter pulled up, continued with a short advantage inside the eighth pole then yielded late.
 GRAND PASSAGE was in the two to the four path through the far turn when never far back then lacked a closing response. GRANDSLAMSURPRISE

 Footnotes
 INSTANT WAR chased the pace from the two to the four path through the turn, was asked for more in late turn, came into the lane from the five path,
 launched a drive into the lane, continued under strong handling from mid-track and just prevailed. STONE SOBER set the pace from the outset, continued
 on a clear lead into the lane, was still clear with an eighth to go and could not last. MIA TIVA TOO was in the three or four path through the turn, came into
 the lane from the five path and rallied for third while never a threat to the top two. ROCKY RUSH chased the pacesetters through the turn while in the two or
 three path, was slowing gaining late and lost the show spot at the wire. ROAD TO JUSTICE was never a threat while in the two or three path through the
 turn. GAMERA was never a factor while in the two path through the turn. REDNECK ROGER was fractious at the gate and was never in it. SWITCH PLATE
 was off to a slow start spotting the field three lengths, raced in the back into the lane and was eased to the wire.

 Footnotes
 BETITALLWITHPAUL tracked the pace along the inside through the far turn, cut the corner when gaining momentum, quickly gained the lead when
 straightening in the lane and was ridden out the last sixteenth. ANGELNAULE raced along the inside through the turn when never far back, shifted out after
 straightening looking for room, angled back towards the inside after the eighth pole and won the duel for place while never a threat to the top one.
 HOOSIER MAIDEN pressed the pacesetter two wide into the far turn, came three wide into the lane, took aim at the winner when straightened, could not
 gain on that one and lost the place duel late. ACCESSORIZING was in the five to the three path through the first turn, raced in the three to the four path
 through the far turn when never far back, came into the lane four wide then leveled out late. LEOTA EVEN BID was in the three path through the turn, came
 into the lane from the two path, angled into the six path and was never a serious factor. PRINCESA STYLE was never a factor while in the two path through
 the turn. COUNTRY DREAMIN set the pace from the two path through mid-turn, relinquished the lead to the winner near the quarter pole and faded through
 the lane. BELLA VELOCHE chased the pace from the two path into the far turn and was done in mid-turn. CORA ANNE was in the six to the four path
 through the first turn, continued in the four path through the far turn and was done nearing the quarter pole.

 while under a hand drive to the wire. ALLDAYLONG was along the inside into the far turn, moved into the four path in late turn, came into the lane from the
 five path and moved up from mid-track. SURE PRIZE was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and moved up for the
 show spot while not a threat. EXPRESS CHARGE was in pursuit through the turn from the three path, bid into the lane to get nearest the winner the
 flattened out nearing the sixteenth pole. PSYCHO CAT trailed into the lane while in the two path, angled from the two to the seven path through the lane and
 moved up. PISTOL PACKIN PETE was steadied at the start, moved up to chase the pace through the turn from the three path then tired through the lane.
 DERBY DAY GRAY pressed then chased the winner through the turn from along the inside then faded through the lane. LUCKY GIANT was in the four to
 the five path through the turn and was never in it. DRUNK UNCLE was in the three or four path through the turn and was finished nearing the quarter pole.
