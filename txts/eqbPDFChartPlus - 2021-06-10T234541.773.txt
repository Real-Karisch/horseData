 Footnotes
 REBEL CORA tracked the pace on the outside while running in the five path, ran very gamely in the stretch between horses and prevailed. ZAHAVA sat well
 rated off the pace while running in the six path, uncoiled a strong outside rally but it was not enough. ORENDA chased the pace between horses while going
 three wide around the turn, ran gamely in the stretch but it was not enough. OUR LORIN ELEANOR was slow into stride but got up and chased the pace
 between horses, went two wide around the turn and ran all out in the stretch. BAYANNE dueled for the lead while running on the inside, gave way in the
 final sixteenth and brushed with TOMBOY TUFF at the same place. TOMBOY TUFF dueled for the lead on the outside while going two wide around the
 turn, dug in for the drive but gave in at the sixteenth pole and was brushed by BAYANNE there too. SUKI'S SEVILITY chased the pace on the inside then
 lacked the needed rally. DEL'S BEAUTY sat well rated off the pace while running in the four path, swung into the stretch in the six path and finished evenly.
 IMPAZIBLE ROCKETTE was fractious in the gate, sat well rated off the pace on the inside then had no response when asked for more. STRIVE TO BE
 HAPPY tracked the pace on the inside then stopped at the three eighths pole. MORE THAN ENOUGH chased the pace on the outside while going four wide
 around the turn but came up empty at the quarter pole.

 FREQUENTLY dueled for the lead while on the outside, took the turn three wide and swung into the stretch in the six path, ran gamely through the stretch
 and surged to the front inside the final sixteenth. GO PLACIDLY dueled for the lead on the inside, swung into the stretch in the two path and ran gamely
 through the finish. SWISS ROSALEE chased the pace on the outside while running in the six and seven paths, responded well when asked and ran all out
 through the finish. PERINA'S PRIDE tracked the pace between horses and took the turn in the four path, swung for home in the six path and uncorked a
 strong outside rally inside the final furlong but it was not enough. BOXING BETTY tracked the pace while running in the two path, swung into the stretch in
 the four path and had no rally. SPARTAN'S BEAUTY chased the pace while running in the three path, swung out into the five path at the top of the stretch
 and weakened. BESS' GIRL dueled for the lead between horses while going two wide around the turn, swung for home in the four path but came up empty
 with a furlong to go. HOPEFUL TIMES tracked the pace on the outside while running in the five and six paths but had no response when asked for more.
 Field stood fully loaded for two minutes as a horse would flip in the gate and be scratched. GO PLACIDLY was taken out and reloaded.

 IGNOTUS vied for the lead on the outside while running on the outside, took the turns in the three and four paths, responded well and ran gamely in the
 stretch then edged clear inside the final sixteenth and won driving. HAIL'S STATEMENT set a pressured pace while running on the inside around the first
 turn, swung into the stretch in the three path digging in for the drive but it was not enough. MY TRAIN chased the pace while going two wide around the first
 turn, was taken up briefly at the three quarters pole, maintained his position on the backstretch then swung for home in the five path where he did not have
 enough. R FLASHY ONE was fractious in the gate but broke well, was void of early speed and took the first turn in the three path, stayed at the back of the
 pack but began to pick up the pace turning for home, swung into the stretch in the six path and was able to pass tired rivals. CLINIC tracked the pace while
 running in the three path then weakened. MAJESTIC VOYAGE took the first turn in the four path while tracking the pace on the outside, turned for home in
 the two path and grew tired. COWTOWN DUKE chased the pace on the outside while running in the four path then weakened for the drive.

 SATURDAYS VAPOR had a comfortable lead while cruising in the two path, drew off with ease in the stretch and was in hand across the line.
 BADMOONONTHERISE reared badly in the gate and broke a few jumps behind the rest of the field, rolled up through the backstretch and got up to track
 the pace by the turn, went around it in the two path then ran all out through the finish. WICKED SISTER was allowed to settle off the pace while running in
 the two and three paths, had a late surge but it was not enough. LOST SCROLL lugged out at the start and bumped into CONGAREES KEY in the process,
 sat well rated off the pace while running in the three path then had no rally. CONGAREES KEY got bumped by LOST SCROLL at the start but shook it off,
 went up and chased the pace while running in the two path but folded up for the drive. ROSIERULES tracked the pace while on the inside and had no
 response when asked for more. LEFTY LUCY was hustled out of the gate but trailed the whole way while in the three path.

 Footnotes
 VICIOUS got squeezed at the start and bumped by IRONBOUND, shook it off and went up to stalk the pace on the outside while in the two path, swung for
 home in the four path while full of run, drew off with a furlong to go and won driving. IRONBOUND lugged out at the break and viciously bumped into
 VICIOUS in the process, shook it off and went up to set a pressured pace while running in the two and three paths, dug in when asked for more but did not
 have enough. MEGACOSM sat well rated off the pace while running in the two path, swung into the stretch in the four path, lacked the needed response but
 proved to be the best of the rest. GOING ABROAD stalked the pace on the inside, swung into the stretch in the two path and faded. CHASING STARS vied
 for the lead on the outside while running in the three path, swung for home in the five path and folded up for the drive. ALL ABOUTHE SALSA was allowed
 to settle off the pace while in the five path, swung for home out in the eight path and had no response.
