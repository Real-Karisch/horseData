 Footnotes
 FUHRELLE tracked along the rail, took the two path into the lane, asked, gained, drifted in nearing the sixteenths pole while going away for the win. SISTER
 SPARROW set the pace along the two path to the furlong marker and then was no match. PARS PEPPERCORN was well placed along the three path,
 lodged a bid and finished with interest. AVABELLA hesitated at the start spotting the field four lengths, three path on the turn and made a mild bid. NEW
 YORK BOURBON saved ground and tired. MOMMA'S MIRACLE ducked out at the start, five wide on the turn, was not a factor. PLASTIC GIRL saved
 ground and tired. ADDIE SUNSHINE lagged far back while six wide on the turn.
