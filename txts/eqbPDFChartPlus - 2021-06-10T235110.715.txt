 Footnotes
 SHE'S SHINEY showed good early speed, built a long lead in the lane, veered in a bit midstretch, was roused by left hand whip to straighten and was clear
 while racing in hand in the latter stages. SHOBIZ SUPERSTAR was allowed to settle early, saved ground while improving position through the lane but was
 no match for the winner. DICEY stalked the pace and weakend from the inside. OUR MUSICAL MOMENT was allowed to settle early, raced three wide
 through the lane and had no response. FOREIGN CREATION failed to respond. MISS ORIENTA failed to sustain a bid.

 Footnotes
 CATAROUX stalked the pace, moved up three wide through the lane and finished well to be clear under strong handling. TAKE CHARGE EASY pressed
 the pace from the inside and finished willingly to the wire. TOAST TIME stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire.
 PHANTOM MENACE stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no final bid. MANTANA saved ground and had no response. THANK
 YA JESUS showed good speed and gave way. TOSEEKORNOT TOSEEK was off a step slow, raced three wide and never was a factor. HUNG OVER ON
 GIN showed little. ONE SILVER DOLLAR was off a step slow, raced towards the inside and never threatened. ONE LUCKY DUDE showed little.
