 CAMANO COMET pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled past the sixteenth pole, inched clear and was all out at the wire. ROXY
 ROCKET was unhurried early, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and was gaining late. DANCING SUNSET was sent to the front to
 set the pace to the second turn, responded when challenged to duel past the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly. CUP OF SOUP raced mid pack outside,
 was within striking distance and lacked the needed late response. FLASHY GOLD saved ground to the second turn, angled out and lacked a stretch
 response. HOT N BREEZY trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. WEST PRINCESS settled off the pace while racing inside, had nothing left for the drive,
 dropped back and was not urged late.
