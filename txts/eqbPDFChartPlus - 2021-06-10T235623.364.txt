 Footnotes
 RAINBOW NORTH broke clean and went right to the front, rated on the lead to the stretch then responded when set down and held stubbornly. NAHEM
 tracked the winner to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then also responded but was held off. VOLKONSKY had no speed, settled to the half,
 shifted three wide on the second turn then made a bit of a run without threatening. POSITIVE OUTCOME pressed the winner three wide to the stretch then
 weakened. DIZZY DANCER stumbled a couple of strides out of the gate, had the rider lose an iron, regained his footing on the first turn but had too much to
 make up. ON FIRE chased the winner to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then gave way.
