 CRAZY ELEXIS prompted the pace outside CHEROKEE JAM through the opening quarter mile, secured command leaving the turn and drew out under
 urging. CHEROKEE JAM bumped with WISHINGUWELL leaving the chute, hugged the early rail while setting the pace and weakened through the stretch.
 FREAKY FAST raced in the two path most of the trip and weakened. FAIR CITY GIRL , three wide on the backstretch and around the turn, finished willingly.
 MORE NOW THAN EVER , in the five path mid way down the backstretch, angled in a bit entering the turn, remained outside horses and failed to rally.
 WISHINGUWELL bumped with CHEROKEE JAM leaving the chute, hugged the inner rail and gave way. QUEEN TO CHECKMATE , steadied to avoid the
 fallen rider entering the turn, raced very wide and was outrun. MISS GOOD GIRL stumbled leaving the starting gate, steadied to avoid the fallen rider
 entering the turn and gave way. PRINCESS A'GO GO , between horses down the backstretch, stumbled and unseated her rider when clipping heels with
 MORE NOW THAN EVER approaching the turn. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the backstretch but no action was taken.

 Footnotes
 LOVE YOU BACK stalked the early pace three wide and under some rating, dropped in a path and aggressively moved to command with a quarter to go,
 kicked well clear into the lane and held firm under a solid left handed drive. MY ADELINE , taken to rate while saving ground, angled out around the final
 turn, came four wide for the drive and finished willingly to gain the place. START WINNING , three wide and off the early pace, picked up steam past the
 three eighths and had the leaders in her sight, gave hard pursuit past the furlong marker then flattened out late between rivals. KATIE'S CADDIE vied early
 outside a rival, pursued two wide leaving the three furlong pole, angled in then steadied briefly around the far turn, moved back out and was between rivals
 into the lane, angled back in and kept on willingly. SIPPY CUP dropped in behind the leading trio entering the first turn, steadied when lacking room nearing
 the quarter pole, angled out and came up empty. NORTHERN PRANCER , wide and off the pace, lacked a bid. R ROUSEY vied inside foes early before
 going clear, opened up soon into the backstretch, ceded to the winner leaving the far turn and faltered through the final furlong.

 Footnotes
 JAX cleared early and angled in to set the pace, dug in when collared by LEOLA LILY leaving the three sixteenths, shook back clear under strong handling
 in mid stretch then was fully extended to hold sway. BALTIMORE BEAUTY settled off the early pace and off the inside, angled out past the three eighths,
 lost ground six wide from the far turn to the wire and closed gamely. NANCY R rated off the pace, raced five wide between rivals leaving the far turn,
 continued well wide and between foes into the lane, brushed with a rival in mid stretch and kept on willingly to close the gap. LOVE MY SISTERS , four wide
 the first turn, edged up and stalked the leaders mid way through the backstretch, angled towards the fence to have dead aim leaving the far turn, steadied
 off heels near the furlong pole, regrouped and stayed inside and kept on with interest. CHAPEL PARTY , bumped and squeezed back at the break, saved
 ground off the pace, eased out and split rivals leaving the far turn, moved up three to four wide into the lane, brushed with NANCY R near the sixteenth pole
 then flattened out. LEOLA LILY bore out at the break, corrected then stalked the pace off the rail, bid two wide nearing the eighth pole, vied into the lane
 then tired in the final seventy yards. DEAR CHARLOTTE , unhurried early, saved some ground into the lane, eased out and had late action between horses.
 SHE BE SASSY , three wide leaving the three eighths pole, came up empty. HONEY BUN saved ground chasing the pace and tired mid way on the final

 sixteenth pole, vied outside SOUPER ECHO and got up late. SOUPER ECHO broke inward and brushed with a rival, moved up three wide nearing the turn,
 rallied between rivals and gained a slim lead in deep stretch but could not quite hold off the winner. IDASIDE sprinted clear early, set the pace inside,
 widened nearing the lane, gave minimal resistance a sixteenth out and weakened. PRANK CALL saved ground chasing the pace, eased out in upper stretch
 and continued willingly. CHAUNCEY , between runners early, swung out in mid stretch and had late interest. SUN DRESS failed to menace. MY SILVER
 BELLE saved ground and failed to menace. SIPPING CHAMPAGNE , three to four wide, was outrun.

 Footnotes
 JUST BEEN JAMMIN , two wide the first turn, moved up three deep around the turn, bid outside BLUEGRASS RYE turning for home, dueled and narrowly
 prevailed. BLUEGRASS RYE drifted in very slightly leaving the chute, sprinted to the lead, angled in entering the first turn, set the pace along the rail,
 dueled late and just missed in a game effort. EL GRAN NOEL , a bit rank soon after the start, swung wide entering the backstretch, remained wide around
 the far turn, was floated to the five path turning for home and rallied outside horses. AIRPORT ROAD , steadied in tight quarters leaving the chute, raced
 three wide the first turn, four wide the far turn and rallied slightly. CHIEF TARHE impeded two rivals when bearing out leaving the chute, chased the pace
 racing two wide, angled out entering the stretch and finished evenly. JACKSON S lacked speed, swung to the four path leaving the far turn, floated to the six
 path in mid stretch and passed tired foes late. CRAZY WILD BILL saved ground around the turns, chased the pace and weakened.
 ALWAYSGOTTHEHAMMER , checked when caught in tight quarters leaving the chute, was no factor and raced in the two path on the far turn. SAM'S WILL
 prompted the pace two wide and faltered. BUZZWORTHY hugged the rail on both turns and faltered. Following an objection by the rider of
 ALWAYSGOTTHEHAMMER, CHIEF TARHE was disqualified and placed eighth. Objections by the riders of AIRPORT ROAD and
 ALWAYSGOTTHEHAMMER against BLUEGRASS RYE for alleged interference soon after the break were not allowed.
