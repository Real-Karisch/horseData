 moved closer before half a mile and faded. SWEET SUMMER STAR dropped back early outside and lacked a rally. REYANA REYA DELITE lacked speed
 and was never in contention. CAROLE'S RAINBOW forced the pace outside to the far turn and gave way. COLESLITTLEMONSTER saved ground, edged
 closer before the half then stopped. NOT IN THE MOOD was outrun early and stopped abruptly.

 in and finished with good energy. FAIRLY BOLD, between foes dueling for command, drifted out and gave way. REBEL VOW, three wide in top flight, also
 drifted out through stretch and weakened. SEA SWAP, very wide, bid on the turn then flattened out. MONEY MAKER three wide and between foes, tired.
 CAPE COD SUN, well off the rail and just of early pace, tired. DANGERUS NOTION showed little.

 GETTING WARMER raced in closest pursuit of the loose pacesetter, took over into the stretch, edged away and remained clear to the finish. SECRET ZAR
 chased wide throughout and closed well with a gradual late gain. AFLEET DESTINY saved ground advancing on the turn, altered course in mid-stretch and
 continued willingly. LILLY MARIE quickly sprinted away, was collared at the quarter pole and faltered. VICTORIA E dropped back after the start and was
 never in contention. STORM BABE raced close up between rivals and began fading on the turn. NEW JERSEY ducked in sharply and then outward just
 after the start causing her rider to lose his irons. FATAL FLASHBACK raced close up outside between rivals and gave way readily.

 LUCKY LEE stalked the pace outside, took over near the three eighths pole and drew away eagerly under moderate urging. IDENTIFIER hustled to the front
 inside, was collared on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. IMPACTFUL chased the leaders between rivals, bore out near the quarter pole but
 continued willingly. DECISIVELY broke a step slowly and trailed for half a mile then showed some late energy. SURFER BOY GEORGE angled inside while
 outrun early and lacked a rally. SACRIFICING IT ALL dropped back early and weakened steadily. VIXSINSFANTASTKFOX was fanned five wide on the first
 turn, remained wide and gave way. BELLATOR was rank under a rating hold inside for half a mile then stopped abruptly.

 entering the stretch, was roused again sharply four times near mid stretch despite holding what appeared to be an insurmountable lead, was finally taken in
 hand near the sixteenth marker and he merely jogged past the wire. NOBLE KENT, off slowest, was outrun inside, moved out and held place. NICE
 SURPRISE passed tiring foes. GENERAL BELLAMY moved out and was never a threat. CONQUEST BIGLUCK E, two wide, tired badly. DIMENSION,
 fractious in the gate, saved ground and stopped. TRILOGY ducked in leaving the gate, chased inside and stopped.

 sixteenth and tired. RAPIDEZ lacked speed, advanced extremely wide and continued willingly. NORMA'S CHARM broke sluggishly, angled inside on the
 turn but flattened out. GIRLS AND GUNS bumped from inside at the start, dropped back and lacked a closing kick. JOYCEE'S SPIRIT dropped back early,

 MZIMA SPRINGS, reserved between foes, rallied after a half, waited for racing room much of the final turn, was steered very wide racing into stretch, closed
 determinedly and was just up. UNBRIDLEDADVENTURE fell back after an alert start, advanced while very wide, challenged on the final turn, fell back
 slightly mid stretch, came back but was outfinished. LIL MISS HOTSHOT, in the four path setting early pace, drifted out in mid stretch and was also coming
 back. PAULITA, three wide, but in the six path, prompting the early pace, challenged on the final turn and fought gamely to wire. B B'S BUSTED was very
 wide into and rounding first turn, remained very wide, took the lead on the final turn, drifted in while opening a clear lead mid stretch but then weakened late.
 MILL AND GLORIA saved ground while never far back, drifted out and faded. GRAZEN HONOR failed to menace. BATMITZVAH prompted racing in the
 five path, tired.

 Footnotes
 CANIFORM dropped well behind, advanced strongly on the turn and was up in the final yards. ONE MORE ROUND vied outside early, was challenged
 again from his outside and continued gamely to the finish. BUZZ WITH ALEX saved ground early, angled out rallying in the stretch, led but was outfinished.
 GUN FOR HIRE lacked speed then closed a gap without menacing. PREP PRIDE vied along the inside to midway on the turn then weakened. STRONG
 BREEZE pursued the pacesetters outside and gave way readily. REST ASSURED saved ground off the pace and stopped. X Y RUNNER lagged far behind
 throughout. AMODEI chased outside and weakened steadily.
