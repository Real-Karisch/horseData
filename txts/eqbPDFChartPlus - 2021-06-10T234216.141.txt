 Footnotes
 CREME DE CERISE stalked the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, launched a challenge from the three path approaching the five sixteenths
 pole and drew clear in the stretch. BATTALSTOWN was squeezed back leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position
 passing the half mile pole, raced around the turn in the four path, and rallied on the outside in the middle of the stretch to just get up for the place. FOGGY
 ALBION raced to the inside of the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, and closed well up the rail in the stretch to just miss the
 place. YABBA DABBA DUDE led the field with a clear advantage through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and tired in
 the final furlong. MAJESTIC DAY raced to the outside of the field in the early stages, dropped back to trail the field from the four path entering the turn, and
 passed tiring horses in the stretch. TALKING ZIP raced between horses up the backstretch, began to improve position from the three path passing the three
 eighths pole and flattened out in the stretch. CAST A STONE raced to the inside of the field for the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn
 and faded in upper stretch.

 Footnotes
 GETTYSBURG tracked well off the leading pair, took closer order approaching the turn, bid inside of TIZ SAMURAI into the bend, split between him and
 STORMINSIDE approaching the three eighths, was briefly turned back by STORMINSIDE into the lane though still in range behind the pacesetter, switched
 inside approaching the furlong pole, launched a rail bid, struck the lead inside of STORMINSIDE with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and drove clear.
 STORMINSIDE set the pace while hounded by TIZ SAMURAI to his outside, edged clear into the turn, set the pace in the two path, was engaged by
 GETTYSBURG to his outside past the three eighths mark, inched out to a clear lead into upper stretch, went to a drive past the three sixteenths, was
 headed from the inside by GETTYSBURG with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and chased that one to the wire. OUR THOMAS came slowly into stride,
 settled in the rear pair inside of TRAVEL WEST down the backstretch and in the two path around the bend, and finished best of the rest inside foes under a
 drive in the lane while proving no match for the top pair. TRAVEL WEST was lightly bumped by TIZ SAMURAI in the opening strides, settled in the rear pair
 two wide down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was urged between horses into the lane but had no rally. TIZ SAMURAI came inward and
 lightly bumped TRAVEL WEST in the opening strides, pressed outside of STORMINSIDE down the backstretch, eased back off that foe into the turn,
 tracked two wide as GETTYSBURG made a bid inside him, was hard ridden past the seven sixteenths for a three wide bid, briefly stayed in range three
 wide, flattened out three wide approaching the stretch and was empty for the drive.

 Footnotes
 BAHAMA KITTEN raced two wide around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged and took over passing the three eighths pole,
 entered the stretch from the two path and shook clear in the final furlong. NORTHERN ALLIANCE raced three wide while fighting her rider some around the
 first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, began to improve position from the three path around the turn, challenged the eventual winner
 passing the eighth pole, and was outkicked by that rival but easily the best of the rest. BONITA SPRINGS raced on the rail around the first turn, stalked the
 frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and finished evenly but was no match for the top two. GODDESS OF
 KIP raced off the pace on the inside for the opening half mile, improved position slightly while saving ground around the far turn and made no real bid in the
 stretch. REAL DE JALPA raced two wide around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and was not a
 factor. TINDERELLA led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path, and tired badly
 in the final quarter of a mile.

 SACRAMENTO Q settled near the rear, inched further up the inside approaching the five eighths to join the chasing flight, continued patiently in close range
 in the three path inside of foes on the turn, dropped to the inside approaching the three sixteenths, swiftly drove to the lead inside of foes, and drove clear in
 the final furlong. OFFLEE FUN chased outside of SPEARED through the early stages, continued three wide from the five eighths when SACRAMENTO Q
 joined the inside of their flight, was pushed along three wide into the turn for a bid, ranged up outside the leading flight past the three eighths, vied three
 wide to the stretch, dug in four wide when SACRAMENTO Q passed to the inside near the three sixteenths, but proved no match in the final furlong. NEW
 ATLAS settled at the rear well off the rail early, trailed in the three path on the turn while taking gradually closer order, went to a drive near the quarter pole,
 and offered a mild inside rally in the lane. BACK PAGE was hustled up to the lead inside, took pressure from OH SO TALL to his outside past the nine
 sixteenths, vied inside that foe while racing in the two path on the turn, continued to vie at the inside of the leading flight into the lane, dug in when headed
 at the three sixteenths but weakened in the final furlong. OH SO TALL was wrangled to stalk outside BACK PAGE, inched forward to press the pace past
 the nine sixteenths, vied outside of that foe into the turn, continued to vie between horses once OFFLEE FUN loomed outside him past the three eighths,
 and flattened from the three sixteenths. SPEARED chased well off the inside early, continued between horses from the five eighths, was pushed along
 between horses past the half mile mark, began to flatten two wide from the five sixteenths and proved empty in the lane.

 Footnotes
 OHIO PLAYER had early speed out of the gate, led the field into the turn, bore out entering the stretch from the four path, drifted out significantly down the
 lane, carrying MIND TRAPPE out with him, and held the win. MIND TRAPPE chased the frontrunner through the opening quarter of a mile, launched a bid
 from the outside around the turn, was pushed out to the five path entering the stretch when OHIO PLAYER bore out on the turn, and continued to be carried
 out by that rival down the lane. WILLOW RIDGE was angsty in the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch on the inside, saved ground around the turn and
 gained ground between horses with a bold rally in late stretch. IM THE BEST I KNOW trailed the field on the outside in the early stages, raced in the two
 path around the turn and finished evenly. BIG AL veered in leaving the gate, raced to the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was
 outfinished. SAMBUCCA raced to the outside of the field through the opening quarter of a mile, started to drop back around the turn, entered the stretch
 from the three path and continued to tire from there.

 CROCE D'ORO hustled to the front, settled on the lead, dictated terms in the two to three paths on the turn, continued comfortably in hand into the lane, and
 opened up under a mild drive in the final furlong. HAWK'S IMAGE settled at the rear of the small field, raced in range at the rear while saving ground
 through the turn, came through inside of CAST IRON into the lane, switched two wide in upper stretch for a bid on CROCE D'ORO, went to a drive near the
 three sixteenths, loomed into the final furlong but proved no match. CAST IRON was asked for early speed but outsprinted by CROCE D'ORO, was pushed
 along past the seven sixteenths to make a bid outside the leader, momentarily loomed two wide, but could not keep pace with CROCE D'ORO approaching
 the five sixteenths and was empty for the drive.

 Footnotes
 STELLA D'ORO raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, began a bold move approaching the three eighths
 pole, came off the turn in the four path, drifted in some while rallying on the outside down the stretch, and prevailed. EXPROMPT (FR) raced in the two path
 around the first turn, raced mid pack up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, continued his bid between horses down the stretch and
 finished gamely, just missing the win. RIVER CACTUS saved ground around the first turn, improved position on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the
 two path around the far turn, led briefly passing the quarter pole, dug in in midstretch and finished gamely while being outkicked. ARRIVAL raced in the two
 path around the first turn, opened up a clear lead in the first quarter, was reeled in by the field some racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the far
 turn, relinquished the lead entering the stretch but battled back in upper stretch and folded late. RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS bumped with the horse to his
 inside leaving the gate, angled over approaching the first turn, continued around the first turn in the three path, raced to the outside up the backstretch,
 entered the stretch from the three path and made no bid. CONTRACTION bumped with the horse to this outside leaving the gate, raced in the three path
 around the first turn, continued up the backstretch between horses, dropped back to last entering the turn, saved ground around the far turn, and passed
 tiring horses in the stretch. DAYS OF GLORY raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in
 the two path and was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 THUNDEROUS GEM sent to the lead, saved ground through the turn while setting the pace, was confronted from the outside by SHILAH BABY past the
 five sixteenths, turned for home with that foe looming outside and MUCHA MEZQUINA looming just inside and behind her, opened up when shaken up into
 the lane, and drew off ridden out while being intermittently shown the crop. SHILAH BABY came in and bumped SISTER RULER lightly in the opening
 strides, raced forward early but was outsprinted by THUNDEROUS GEM, tracked in range down the backstretch and into the turn, angled out to the three
 path for a bid near the three eighths, ranged up outside of THUNDEROUS GEM past the five sixteenths and loomed into the lane, proved no match with the
 pacesetter when she was shaken up, but chased gamely under a drive and dug in between horses to hold the place. SISTER RULER was lightly bumped by
 SHILAH BABY in the opening strides and then taken back to settle near the rear, continued in the three path on the turn, began to rally past the three
 eighths, split horses past the five sixteenths, tipped four wide into the lane, continued with interest under a drive three wide but could not reel in SHILAH
 BABY for the place. MUCHA MEZQUINA chased inside foes down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, came into the lane inside under a drive in
 range, was no match for the winner into the lane, kept on mildly inside but was outfinished. GRAY OWL broke outward soundly bumping GLAMOUR GAL in
 the opening strides, tracked the leading pair two wide down the backstretch, continued to chase two wide in the four path on the turn, fanned five wide into
 the lane, and kept on four wide without finding the needed kick. GLAMOUR GAL was bumped hard by GRAY OWL in the opening strides, settled at the
 rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, was urged past the three eighths pole and ridden into the stretch, and took closer order under a drive in the lane.
