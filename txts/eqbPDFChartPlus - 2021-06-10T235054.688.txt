 Footnotes
 SUN AND SAND allowed the pace to go early off the inside, advanced on the front pair while wide out of the final turn, challenged nearing the furlong
 grounds far out in the strip and wore the leader down under firm handling. CHING CHING dueled up front off the inside, headed far turn, regained the
 advantage and put the other speed away as he was being challenged by the winner, proved stubborn to the end. FRIEND TO ME forwardly placed in the
 second flight, chased the dueling leaders into the lane in the two path, set down, proved no match for the top pair while being along for the show late.
 DEWEY'S SUNSHINE alternated for the lead closest to the inside for over six furlongs, faltered in the drive, caught late for the show. CLASSIC BRAHMS
 bobbled slightly at the start, raced back, improved position slightly while not a serious threat. CALLITWHATYAWANT void of early foot in trailing for a half,
 not a serious threat while picking off a couple of tiring rivals in the drive. TEN GLITTERS remained always back. DONTTAKEITPERSONAL four wide
 through the first turn, tired.

 Footnotes
 ELLIE GIRL settled comfortably behind the leaders inside, continued save ground when moving closer in the second turn, advanced and split foes upper
 straight, brushed, took over, drew off, ridden out in a sharp effort. KENTUCKY BROWN broke alertly, angled in to set the pace while racing along the rail,
 offered brief resistance to the winner when confronted in upper stretch, proved no match for that one late, remained clear for the place. GLIDE BABY GLIDE
 lacked speed while saving ground, steered out for the drive, staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest. TRUST IN DIANE void of early foot, displayed a
 mild amount of belated interest to improve position. BEST GUESS back early, improved before four furlongs, went evenly the last half mile in lacking a late
 kick. SOUTHERN GOLD pressured the runner up from the outside for six furlongs and began to give way. CINCO CINCO DIEZ forwardly placed while four
 wide into the first turn, began to fade after five furlongs. SUNNY SISTER steadied slightly at the start when the runner up angled over, was finished before a
 half.

 Footnotes
 JUBAL in the second flight early while inside, moved closer while continuing toward the rail into the far turn, moved out a bit for room when straightened for
 home, bid inside the furlong marker, fully extended to be edging away late. MASCULINO set the pace while firmly in hand along the inside, continued to
 show the way second turn and into the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, remained clear for the place. BEAU GATOR rank in the early going when
 in some traffic, moved outside, closer turning for home, could manage no late gain on the top two. ALABAMA SLIM pressured the pace while racing three
 wide, vied into the lane then began to weaken. BLUEGRASS PUNCH went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. COUCHE COUCHE void of
 early foot, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. ON CYCLE off a step sloe, remained always back while racing wide into the lane. JUST
 RUN SKINY RUN forced the issue for six furlongs while between foes then gave way in the drive. FARMERVILLE raced in mid pack early, stopped and
 finished far back.

 Footnotes
 MORETHANFISHIN broke well, raced with the pace from the outset, drew strongly clear in the drive under own courage to win ridden out. FLAT OUT LOVE
 raced back off the pace while saving ground and under restraint, called on for some run second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway
 for the place. CLASSIC EMMETT hopped at the start, raced back and off the inside, rallied for be in time for the show, not enough for the runner up late.
 TUNE MY GUITAR lacked speed, checked up in some traffic onto the backstretch, continued in the second flight, three wide into the lane, lacked the
 necessary closing response. NIAGARA STORM pressured the issue from between foes for almost six furlongs and weakened. RED ROUX forwardly placed
 early, had little left for the drive after racing outside. FLORIDA LINE off a step slow, was used while five wide into the first turn to make the early advantage,
 gave way.

 Footnotes
 WHOZ TALKIN NOW outrun early, continued to lag turn, came five wide into the stretch when beginning to move and closed with a rush down the middle of
 the strip to be in time. JOBAY with the pace from the start, vied between foes into and through the turn, could not contain the winner late while proving game
 for the place. MASSTER CHIEF RON vied early between foes, dropped to the inside for the turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, also
 failed to contain the winner while being outfinished for the place late. BACK IN BUSINESS with the pace five wide early, four wide into the turn, chased the
 two leaders past the furlong marker when beginning to weaken and continued to falter slightly. MIGHTY INTIMIDATOR off a step slow, raced well back,
 moved with the winner while fanned six wide into the lane, could not keep up with that one the final furlong, managed to improve a bit more late. BUXTON
 BOY off the pace in mid pack and outside, moved a bit closer four wide turning for home then failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. SPARKY
 SPARKLES with the pace closest to the inside, shuffled back along the rail into the turn and continued to fade. RED PRODUCTION back off the pace, was
 boxed in through much of the turn toward the inside. ROOSTER BULLET within striking distance early, began to tire before a half while off the inside. CAT
 SUP fell back trail, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. TOBIT with the pace while three wide and between rivals, shuffled back into the turn
 and continued to retreat. SILVER DODDGE forwardly placed in the early going outside, steady retreat while four wide.

 SHUCKS broke alertly, narrowly set the pace off the inside, shook clear nearing the furlong grounds, led late, nipped. KENAI STAR void of early foot, began
 to loom a threat five wide out of the turn, set down, flattened out a bit in the late going while between the top two at the wire. JUST STORMIN off the pace
 while well out in the strip, came four wide out of the turn while also appearing to be a threat, went evenly the final sixteenth. MACANDALES in the second
 group, came between rivals out of the turn, lacked the needed closing response. ZENDELPHIAN forwardly placed for five furlongs off the inside, came up
 empty for the drive. RED WINED UP void of speed, roused three wide out of the turn, passed tiring ones. KING CAKE off a step slow, trailed for five
 furlongs, also picked off some faltering rivals while never a threat. TAMMANY PARKWAY forwardly placed early, advanced with a three wide bid in the turn,
 gave way in the drive. FLIT N TIME steadily faded. OUR SMITTY flashed brief speed inside and stopped.

 Footnotes
 SPECIAL BLESSING settled off a slow pace while racing outside, advanced and challenged with a three wide bid midway on the final turn, dueled into and
 through upper stretch, slowly clear the final sixteenth while under firm handling. YES GORGEOUS prompted the slow pace early, advanced and joined the
 leader onto the backstretch,dueled into the far turn, vied between foes through much of that bend, dueled inside the winner past midstretch then could not
 match strides, clearly second best. BELLA CAJUN set a soft early pace inside, continued to duel the middle half, proved no match for the top two in the
 drive, comfortably saved the show. MISS WEKATI off the early pace, closer with a brief bid four wide into the far turn, fell back off the leaders soon after,
 bumped with SHE SANG DIXIE turning into the stretch, went evenly to the wire. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF SHE SANG DIXIE AGAINST MISS
 WEKATI FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE FINAL TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED. MILA'S GOLD fell back to trail after the start, made little
 impact. SHE SANG DIXIE last away, void of any early foot, exchanged a bump with MISS WEKATI late in the final turn then failed to muster a rally.
 GOLDEN BOMBSHELL forwardly placed in the early going, steadily faded.

 Footnotes
 HONEST SCARLET behind the leaders while well off the inside, angled in a bit in the turn, set down for the drive and finished with good resolve to be up in
 time. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF TIZ ONE FEE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE BY HONEST
 SCARLET ENTERING THE TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. SYRUP CAKE with the leaders while between horses, continued to vie into
 the lane, held the advantage late but was unable to contain the winner. TIZ ONE FEE behind the leaders while racing off the inside, steadied slightly when
 in tight entering the turn, fell back a bit, three wide into the lane, altered course with a furlong to run to the far outside and finished willingly. TONI'S VOW
 void of speed, came four wide out of the turn, stage a mild rally. HANNAH BANANA broke out but alertly, showed the way out of the chute, vied into and
 through the turn closest to the inside and began to weaken. D'KELLYGOESWILD away in good order, vied up front three wide and then gave way in the
 drive. COMMANDING ACTION in the second flight for a half along the inside, had little left for the drive. SHE'S A PENALTY failed to menace.
 OUTOFTHEBALLPARK remained always back and was never a factor. MADAM'S DANCING last to leave, trailed throughout.
