 Footnotes
 BLAME THE RIDER had speed outside a rival then angled in, set the pace inside, dueled on the backstretch and into the second turn, inched away leaving
 that turn, kicked clear under urging in the stretch and held gamely. MAJESTIC EAGLE angled in and saved ground off the pace, came a bit off the rail into
 the second turn, swung four wide into the stretch and finished well. SELLWOOD pulled between horses then stalked off the rail on the first turn, bid outside
 the winner on the backstretch and most of the second turn, continued just off the rail into the stretch and narrowly held third. CAJUN TREASURE stalked
 between horses on the first turn then outside a rival, came three deep into the stretch and just missed the show. FRIENDLY OUTTHEDOR angled in and
 saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. POINTED chased three deep on the first turn then outside a rival,
 came three wide into the stretch and also lacked the necessary late kick. DIGNITAIRE pulled along the inside early, saved ground stalking the pace
 throughout and weakened some in the final furlong. PAPA JOE a bit slow to begin, angled in and settled inside then outside a rival leaving the backstretch,
 came four wide into the stretch, angled inward in upper stretch and lacked a rally.

 Footnotes
 ANITA G. stalked the pace off the rail, bid outside the pacesetter to gain the lead into the stretch, inched away under urging in midstretch and held under
 steady handling late. RECKLESS CHARM went up inside to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, fought back into the stretch, could not quite match the
 winner in the final furlong but continued willingly. MINING DIAMONDS was in a good position stalking the pace off the rail then outside the winner on the
 turn, came three wide into the stretch and bested the others. DIXIE CRYSTAL saved ground chasing the pace, came a bit off the rail in the stretch and
 lacked a further response. OUTA HERE chased off the inside then outside a rival, continued between foes into and on the turn and into the stretch and
 weakened. JUST BE HELD ducked in, threw her head and hopped in a very slow start, came off the rail early, went three wide into and on the turn and into
 the stretch and did not rally. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start before ruling JUST BE HELD was the cause of her own trouble.

 NINE POINT NINE angled in and stalked inside, came out into the stretch and in upper stretch, bid three deep under left handed urging past the eighth pole,
 gained the advantage in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. A LITTLE BIT ME three deep early, dueled outside a rival, fought back between horses past
 midstretch, could not match the winner late but outfinished her pace foe for second. RED LIVY (IRE) had good early speed and dueled inside, fought back in
 the stretch, could not match strides with the top pair late and just held third. ROOMS saved ground stalking the pace, came off the rail a sixteenth out and
 was edged for the show. PROUD 'N' READY chased outside a rival, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. BEAUTIFUL BECCA a step slow
 into stride, settled inside then chased a bit off the rail, came out leaving the hill and four wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary late
 response. ZUZANNA also a bit slow to begin, settled off the rail then inside, came a bit off the fence in the stretch and also lacked the needed rally. SAIDA
 pulled a bit between horses early, stalked outside a rival down the hill, continued just off the rail into the stretch and weakened. Rail on hill at 14 feet.
