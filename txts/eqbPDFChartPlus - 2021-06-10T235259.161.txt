 UNCLE B saved ground along rail in the first turn, continued stalk near inside through the backstretch then picked up pace in the far turn, moved up two
 wide to challenge CLASS AND CASH for the lead, matched strides then took command in final furlong and finished clear. CLASS AND CASH sped to the
 lead, cleared from outside and angled inside to save ground, continued lead the way under some pressure from CONQUEST SANDMAN, shook free to
 clear lead and widened advantage entering lane, fought back when challenged by winner near eighth pole but lacked closing kick in late reserve.
 CONQUEST SANDMAN was forwardly placed applying some pressure to CLASS AND CASH, could not maintain close advantage with rival past the half
 mile marker but remained in pursuit three wide through far turn, kept on along rail in the lane. GLOBAL ENTRY broke out and brushed at the start, raced in
 the back then drifted out upper stretch under left handed encouragement, needed more for late impact. JAGR was unhurried and saved ground running
 through the backstretch, put to drive three wide in the lane, lacked needed response for serious impact. BIRD HUMOR step slow then brushed at the start,
 failed to respond. FERGIELICIOUS raced in contention then retreated after half mile marker. Race was hand timed

 Footnotes
 LI'L MEATBALL held narrow lead under some pressure in early stages, cleared on top past the half mile marker, widened advantage to commanding lead
 then kept to task along inside in the lane. HORNER MAN was forwardly placed in opening stages applying some pressure to LI'L MEATBALL, could not
 maintain remain in touch with rival past half mile marker then lost position three furlongs out, dropped to rail then angled out top stretch and continued solid
 bid for second best. KING MAURO raced off the early pace then swung wide into drive, moved in few oaths and bested the rest for share. WOODBURN
 raced in the back then wide in the lane, improved position. RUNAWAY BULL raced in range along outside, sent driving three path entering lane trying to
 gain runner up spot then failed to sustain bid past eighth pole. KOKOMO WILDCAT chased the early pace, driving two path top stretch then had nothing left
 on late reserve. RED HOT RANDY waited briefly along rail near half mile marker then got through and hustled up through turn, angled out top stretch and
 dropped back. MCFLY lacked response after the half.

 STEVE'S SONATA hustled up at the start and closed in on leader midway through turn, dueled outside of TRAVY BOY at the quarter pole, continued battle
 into stretch then took command a furlong out and pulled away. TRAVY BOY broke on top and sped to clear lead, challenged by STEVE'S SONATA and
 dueled inside at the quarter pole, battled back upper stretch then could not move on with rival, finished clearly second best. PERFECT BONUS was
 reserved racing wide in early stages then finished with response gaining position through the lane. LITTLE SHACKLEFORD hopped at the start then
 bumped just after, raced in contention off top two then drifted out five wide going through turn, kept along finishing evenly in the lane. ELASTICO raced
 outside off early pace then three to four wide going by eighth pole for mild improve. HIGH MISCHIEF chased the early pace then gaveway in the lane. HO
 VINTO IO raced five wide midpack then failed to move on in the lane. HOME POWER raced off the pace then five wide entering lane lacking needed rally.
 BARITONE lacked speed, saved ground to no avail. KAUFY BUZZ stumbled very hard at the start, rider stayed aboard but was too much to over come.
