 Footnotes
 BROADWAY ICE last to leave, trailed while saving ground into and through the turn, tilted out into the three path when straightened for home, quickly
 reached the leaders under confident handling a furlong out, won going away, ridden out. BET AGAIN with the pace from the start between foes, narrowly
 showed the way through the turn in the two path, slightly larger advantage into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best.
 SOUTHPINE GIFT vied up front along the in side, had little for the top two in the drive, comfortably saved the show. ABSOLUTELYPOSITIVE vied five wide
 into the turn, four wide exiting, had little left for the drive. G CISIVE broke well, forced the issue three wide and between horses, weakened. FIRE MAKERS
 STAR speed for three furlongs while four wide, began to weaken in the turn, continued to give way stretch.

 Footnotes
 PADDY O'LIONEL outrun early while under restraint and along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, called on for run soon after, got
 through a large opening into the stretch, challenged, long drive, fully extended to prove best. FIRE LAKE within striking distance early toward the inside, in
 traffic through much of the second turn, three wide into the lane, roused when clear, finished willingly to earn the place. RESILIENT RICK void of speed for
 almost six furlongs, angled out to be five wide when beginning to advance turning for home, rallied well out in the course to earn the show. THUNDERBERG
 forwardly placed outside, put a head in front into the far turn, continued to vie into and through upper stretch, proved stubborn until late. SAND PIT ROAD
 back off the early pace, moved closer while four wide through the final turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. WHO DATAWAKI narrowly set the
 pace for five furlongs, was beginning to weaken late in the final turn off the inside allowing the winner to slip through, continued to falter in the run to the
 wire. TROUBLE IN PHOENIX last to leave, moved up to race in the main body outside, floated out six wide into the lane, faded through the straight. TEN
 SILVER PINS pressed the issue for a half and gave way.

 Footnotes
 FIERY FLASH away in good order, forwardly placed, continued to prompt the issue three wide turn, took over into the lane, slowly drove clear. FLEETA
 BELLE settled off the pace and the inside, three wide and behind the winner turning for home, could do little with that rival in the run to the wire, clearly
 second best. WILDLY GRAND broke sharp, set or forced the pace inside the winner, could not match strides with that one in slowly weakening through the
 stretch, no match late for the runner up. IDE B A SOLDIER fell back steadily the opening furlong, two path turn, staged a mild rally to improve past the
 furlong marker, little impact late. J.'S GIRL lacked speed, went one paced through the lane in lacking a significant closing response. SHANGHAI STAR
 lacked speed off the inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. LINDA'S LEGACY flashed early foot, began to give way before three
 furlongs. CRAPAUD staged a steady retreat. BROKE AND PRAYING off slowly, was always outrun while racing wide.

 Footnotes
 ROGER BROWN broke sharp, set all t he pace while racing toward the inside, stayed clear the final furlong under steady handling. RIVER BOBCAT also
 broke well, pressured the winner from the outside, could not get to that one the final furlong, fully extended to hold the place late. C C HARRIS broke back,
 advanced into the turn, shifted out a bit in upper straight when roused, getting to the runner up late. WHISKEY BRAVO lacked early foot, in some traffic
 while idling into the turn, shifted out to be wide in the drive, improved position outside. WARRIOR'S KID closest to the top two while outside for a half,
 weakened in the final furlong. LUKES BAD BOY mid pack while racing off the inside, lacked a closing response. BLACK JUSTICE in mid pack early,
 steadied slightly in traffic entering the turn, lacked a kick when clear for the drive. STORMATION remained back in failing to threaten. ONLY LIQUOR tired
 from early efforts. BIG EM C last away, raced wide while never a factor.

 Footnotes
 HISTORY EARNED allowed to settle behind the pace toward the inside, moved out and made a good advance four out to five wide exiting the final turn,
 gained command past the furlong marker when under pressure and drew clear. THUNDER BOX forwardly placed off the inside, advanced and challenged
 far turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane, could not match strides with the winner, held sway for the place late. WHEN I DO away in good order,
 dueled early off the inside, clearly showed the way up the backstretch, second duel through the final turn, continued to vie past the furlong marker, proved
 stubborn to the end while being outkicked for the place. PURPLE HEART ROAD went evenly paced in lacking a closing response. MY CLASSIC BOWTIE
 also went one paced throughout in lacking a winning bid. SON OF PATRIOT lacked early foot, improved a bit the third quarter, lacked a significant closing
 response. CAESAR POINT remained always back while picking off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. FOUND MY WAY broke slowly
 and was never a threat. STRIKING STAR early foot along the inside, began to back up after a half. ST BASIL four wide into the first turn, was finished early.

 Footnotes
 I AM READY AGAIN pressed the issue early inside, moved up to duel through some soft early splits, continued to vie into the lane, long drive, proved
 narrowly best late in game fashion. CAP ROCK MINER took over soon after the start, helped set the slow fractions while racing off the inside, continued to
 hold the advantage midstretch, outkicked late. ERIK THE RED void of speed the opening quarter, made an early move while four wide before a half, tracked
 the top two into the stretch, slowly getting to that pair late. INVASORS WIND in the second flight while racing outside, came four wide when advancing into
 the lane, flattened out a bit in the final furlong. PINCH ASSAULT well off the early pace inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, improved a bit late
 without posing a serious threat. GREELEY'S DEALER remained always back in failing to rally. BERKO had little left for the drive.

 MISS SOONER GIRL broke a step slow, continued back, roused off the inside into the lane, rallied through traffic to be up in time. SISSY'S KITTEN
 forwardly placed from the start, continued to maintain contact with the leader, took over entering the straight, lugged out under a repeated left handed stick
 past the furlong grounds to bump and bother THIS IS MY PRAYER, led late, nipped by the winner at the wire. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
 REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF THIS IS MY PRAYER AGAINST SISSY'S KITTEN FOR INTERFERENCE
 IN MIDSTRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD. THIS IS MY PRAYER settled off the pace and the inside, advanced to
 challenge into the straight, floated out, bumped and bothered a furlong out, finished up evenly. TWO SKIES in mid pack early while saving some ground, in
 the two path out of the final turn, eased out a bit in some traffic late, also was going evenly at the end. SMOK'N RITA off the pace and the inside, four wide
 when roused upper straight, floated out a bit late, lacked the needed late punch as well. LADYGOGENTLY lacked speed, came widest for the drive, made
 little impact. FUSAICHI SUNSHINE off a bit slow, remained back. GOLD PASS sprinted clear after an alert break, showed the way through the first turn,
 gave way when headed. WIMBLEDON'S KISS forwardly placed in the first turn outside, continued rather wide, gave way far turn, jogged in.

 Footnotes
 RIFLE MAN in the second flight, called on for some run late in the second turn, split foes into the stretch to challenge, drove clear. REDDY TO BET broke
 on top, helped set a soft pace, showed the way into the lane in the three path, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. NIPPY RED stalked the
 pace, continued forwardly placed while four wide into the lane, lacked a winning bid, clear of the others. ATLANTIC RULER broke back, lacked speed, went
 evenly through the stretch while also lacking a significant response. BOSTON BOB void of speed, came five wide out of the final turn, passed a couple of
 tiring foes while not a threat. GUEYDAN dueled early along the inside and gave way. DREWSIZZLE remained always back while racing wide.

 Footnotes
 CHASING A SAINT took command after the start, continued to show the way turn along the inside, held sway through the lane while being kept to task.
 GOOD AIR away in good order, raced within striking distance well out in the strip, set down for the drive, could not get to the winner. KANNON'S BAD BOY
 lacked speed for three furlongs inside, angled out entering the stretch, finished willingly while too late. ZARB'S PISTOL in mid pack early off the inside,
 moved closer in some traffic turn, lacked a further advance in the drive to flatten out. FOOLING JAY also in the second flight through the turn, came up
 empty for the drive as well.. DOUBLE LUNAR pressured the winner for a quarter and began to weaken. INGOT IN THE SAND failed to muster much of an
 impact outside. CHATAIN'S WITA fell well back after the start, remained back through the turn, passed tiring rivals while not a threat. RAIL'S GENUINE
 BOY wide trip, no threat. ASH TAX steadily faded. LIL SHARP LEWIE backed up through the stretch.
