 Footnotes
 MR THUNDER BOY was unhurried two wide, angled to the rail entering the far turn, rallied into the stretch, took over just before a mile and was quickly
 clear. GAMBLIN JACK showed speed from the outset, ran out while clear into the first turn, remained out from the inside, ran out entering the stretch and
 gave way. RED WARRIOR settled inside, was sent closer into the far turn, swung out entering the stretch, gave his best into the final furlong and flattened
 out. MANACOR (IRE) came out three wide between horses for room while moving on the final turn then lacked a further response. REAL POWER was
 content to lag inside, swung wide into the stretch but lacked a strong closing. FLEET STREET was slow early, raced two wide run into the stretch and
 lacked a rally. JUST A SCIP wasn't far back outside, fanned four wide on the final turn then tired. BEAR'S COWBOY wasn't far back inside early, came out
 two wide on the final turn then stopped. BARLEY TWIST raced four wide around the final turn and stopped.
