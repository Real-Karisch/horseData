 Footnotes
 HEY FUNNY raced up close from the start, moved for the lead mid turn, dueled outside of TIZ ALL BIZ to mid stretch, slowly edged clear holding firm under
 encouragement to the wire. PRETTY GRITTY taken in hand leaving the gate, settled towards the rear, advanced mid turn, angled three wide upper stretch,
 surged willingly from the eighth pole getting up for second place. TIZ ALL BIZ set a rated pace traveling along the rail, headed mid turn, battled to mid
 stretch, yielded grudgingly at the sixteenth pole besting the rest. BLUMIN SWEETHEART tracked to the far turn, hard ridden at the quarter pole, lacked
 response beating others. CRAFTY INDY void of early foot, settled in the second flight, saved ground throughout, slightly improved placing in the lane but
 never menaced. ON THE ROAD tracked running four to five wide to the half, failed to respond when asked and tired in the lane. CAGEY BABY stalked to
 the far turn racing three wide, gave chase at the quarter pole, had little left in upper stretch and faded to the finish line. MYSWEETVALENTINE was always
 a step slow, trailed throughout showing little.

 CAN'T GET ENOUGH set a rated pace to the far turn, was threatened by PALTARREVENGE turning for home, traveled in the tree path turning that rival
 away in the lane holding safe to the wire. PALTARREVENGE settled early, gained mid turn racing three wide, bid outside of CAN'T GET ENOUGH entering
 the stretch, was turned away in the drive and settled for second best in a hard try. BALK stalked to the far turn, began to chase from mid turn, lacked rally
 and tired in the lane while holding third place. BADUKE raced up close to the half running inside, began to drop off leaving the quarter pole and was no
 factor in the lane. THORNADO was soon outrun, showed little.

 Footnotes
 WILD RIDER broke well, came in a bit shortly after the start, cleared early traveling towards the inside, increased margin in mid stretch winning in hand
 crossing the wire. MORNING MUSE unhurried from the gate racing mid track, gained on the turn to loom off the winner at the quarter pole, proved no match
 in the final furlong but was a willing second best. RAGTIME BAND lacked early foot running off the rail, passed tiring foes in the lane taking third place. IAN
 SMITH rushed hard shortly after the start to press the winner early, could not keep pace entering the stretch and weakened to miss a minor share. PIECE
 OF EIGHT raced up close soon after the start running between foes, was caught in tight and squeezed steadying going into the far turn, failed to recoup and
 never menaced. GEE PEA ESS broke well and came inward tightening up rivals, chased from mid turn, weakened mid stretch. EL COMANDER vied for the
 early lead running between foes, was in tight and jostled around going into the far turn, dropped off at the three eighths pole, was eased turning for home,
 rider dismounted and was vanned off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING GOING INTO THE FAR TURN RESULTED IN NO CHANGES AND
 RESULTS STOOD AS IS.
