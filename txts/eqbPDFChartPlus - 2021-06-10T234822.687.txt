 Footnotes
 SCARLETT'S RANSOM set the pace well off the rail, was put to a drive in upper stretch and was never threatened while kept to her business. BROOK'S
 ON FIRE , three deep on the turn, was bumped by NEXT STREET when that one was carried out near the five sixteenths pole then continued willingly.
 NEXT STREET raced in the two path on the turn, checked and bumped BROOK'S ON FIRE when forced out by CHIPS ICLUDED near the five sixteenths
 pole, angled out for the drive and lacked a rally. CHIPS ICLUDED , a forward factor along the rail entering the turn, drifted out near the five sixteenths pole
 then gave way. BACKSEAT DRIVER , along the inner rail around the turn, trailed.

 Footnotes
 BADUKE set a pressured pace inside, responded when let out near the quarter pole repelling a challenge, kicked away leaving the three sixteenths and
 continued eagerly while under a drive to the finish. GREAT SMOKE , away alertly, tracked the leaders while three wide, moved menacingly past the five
 sixteenths to take aim, kept on willingly and just held the place. DR BOLT bobbled at the break, regrouped and settled off the pace while saving ground,
 angled out gathering some momentum into the lane, straightened away to be five wide and continued with interest. CAST A DOUBT pressed the pace
 outside the winner, failed to kick on under pressure in upper stretch and faded. TENS WILD was taken in hand soon after the break, raced removed from
 the inside and failed to menace.

 ONE STEP CLOSER pulled his way to the lead leaving the chute, moved clear under rating near the five eighths, controlled the issue in the two path,
 spurted away nearing the lane as his rider took a peek back to measure any competition, responded to right handed rousing through the final furlong and
 held sway. ICE TEA drafted back further off the leaders leaving the half mile marker, was under pressure two wide into the lane, progressed between
 runners near mid stretch, altered out and closed gamely. EL MANUT broke a step slow, was taken to rate while saving ground, angled out nearing the
 furlong grounds and finished willingly. C B BODEMESTER settled off the pace, raced between foes leaving the far turn, was put to a stiff drive mid turn,
 angled five wide for the drive but could only muster up a mild kick. WHAT R U DOING NOW , between foes early, secured the rail around the turn, was
 shoved along making some headway past the three sixteenths then flattened out late. CAN'TMAKETHISUP veered out at the break, corrected but lost
 ground four to five wide, was under pressure around the turn but lacked a bid. PRINTER , brushed at the break, was hustled up soon after and stalked three
 wide, was under a firm ride chasing the winner into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. THREE BEANS was backed out of the gate pre race,
 lagged three wide off the pace and faded around the turn.

 Footnotes
 WATERHAVEN vied outside MR. SMARTY PANTS, entered the lane four wide and gained a short lead soon after, came in under right handed rousing
 bumping MR. SMARTY PANTS leaving the eighth pole, drifted in slightly while clear and under the right stick near the sixteenth pole and held firm. SELF
 START broke a step slow, recovered and advanced wide and in hand heading towards the turn, continued progress three wide and to the inside of
 BELTANY, altered out five wide soon into the lane, straightened away and churned on willingly to nab the place in the final yards. MR. SMARTY PANTS
 took command soon after the break, set a pressured pace towards the fence, wandered outward to about the three path entering the stretch, straightened to
 duel inside WATERHAVEN, was bumped and forced in by that one departing the furlong grounds and gave way grudgingly. BELTANY , a bit rank stalking
 the leaders three wide heading towards the half mile marker, came under a ride mid turn, was fanned six wide turning for home, straightened and lacked the
 needed finish. SATISFYING edged up along the rail nearing the half mile marker, failed to quicken with the leaders leaving the far turn, angled off the inside
 and came up empty. SUPER CAUSEWAY drafted back off the lead after an alert beginning, secured the rail leaving the far turn but had no stretch kick.
 Following an objection by the rider of MR. SMARTY PANTS, WATERHAVEN was disqualified from first and placed third for causing interference in the
 stretch

 IT'S THE JOURNEY , poised three wide just off the leaders, moved in hand to reel in WILLIE B MINE after a half, asserted himself after being set down in
 upper stretch, kicked clear under solid right handed rousing in mid stretch, was kept to solid pressure to the sixteenth pole then cruised home the final
 seventy yards. WILLIE B MINE accelerate inside to take command, met a pair of challengers from his outside leaving the far turn, staved off the winner to
 the quarter pole, failed to match strides leaving the sixteenth marker but continued willingly to be clear for the place. TO BLAVE hesitated at the break,
 settled well back, came under pressure leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the lane and kept on with interest. HOW'S YOUR SUGAR , sluggish from
 the gate, lagged off the pace, saved ground making some headway into the lane, continued willingly to mid stretch then flattened out. GRECIAN PRINCE ,
 four wide chasing the leaders, was under solid pressure past the five sixteenths, failed to go on in upper stretch and faded. MINOR LEGEND , three to four
 wide, was ridden along mid turn and came up empty. LOUIE LUNCHBOX prompted the pace two wide, challenged between foes leaving the far turn, could
 not quicken past the five sixteenths and dropped back.

 handling to the sixteenth marker, dug in when collared and stayed on well. CHAMBERLIN ROAD lost ground five wide, advanced under a ride into the lane
 and churned on willingly while saving the show. IMPORTANT , bumped at the break, eased back from between rivals nearing the turn, shifted out six wide

 out. TIZ MAJESTY advanced inside to contention after three furlongs, chased around the turn and faded. STRANGERS NO MORE , four wide between
 rivals, was under pressure mid turn and faded. LOVE IN EXCESS came in at the break and bumped a rival, saved ground and weakened. NOT MINE BUT
