 Footnotes
 RON'S ANSWER set the pace clear of the field to the stretch, urged through the lane and held off the late charge at the wire. FREAKY MONIQEE settled
 early, raced three to four wide around the turn, rallied form the outside and just missed. EVENING AGAIN traveled along the inside, angled out on the turn,
 chased through the lane but finished evenly. CUTE TALKER saved ground off the pace and produced a mild rally to whittle the gap. WONDERFUL BECKY
 broke well from the outside then dropped to the back of the pack, took the turn two wide and was never a factor.

 between JEN'S JOURNEY, ROCKY'S SHOW, and DREAM ON BROTHER and ruled that DREAM ON BROTHER caused the incident by breaking inward
 and since he finished behind ROCKY'S SHOW there would be no change in the order of finish.
