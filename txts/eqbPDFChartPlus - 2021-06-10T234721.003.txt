 Footnotes
 HORSE SPOTTER CARL bumped with MO BOURBON at the start, settled within striking range of a three-way pace battle two wide, moved out four wide to
 launch a bid late on the turn, challenged outside JOURNEY'S END, and wore that foe down while getting brushed twice late. JOURNEY'S END battled for
 the lead between horses for three furlongs, put both early rivals away coming to the quarter-pole only to be joined immediately from the outside by HORSE
 SPOTTER CARL, dug in stubbornly to maintain a short lead, then drifted late and yielded while brushing with the winner twice. MO BOURBON bumped with
 HORSE SPOTTER CARL at the start, then was bumped a stride later by FIRST GOAL, lacked room inside and steadied briefly behind the leaders soon
 afterward, swung out three then four wide being roused at the top of the stretch, had a clear shot but did not have enough. DATTTS ARTIES BOY was
 devoid of speed two wide, shifted out for the drive and failed to threaten with a mild late response. LEMON ROYAL hopped at the break to get away slowly,
 raced four wide and was no factor. STARSHIP DANNY checked at the start behind FIRST GOAL and trailed well back three to four wide, came five wide to
 the stretch and remained outrun. FIRST GOAL veered out sharply impeding STARSHIP DANNY and bumping MO BOURBON after the start, was sent up to
 duel inside rivals and was finished before reaching the stretch. KOKOMO WILDCAT contested the pace three wide, moved to the inside giving way leaving
 the turn, and dropped back steadily.

 Footnotes
 SAVANNAH ROXANNA took rail position in opening quarter and settled nicely just off leader, continued to save ground along rail then angled out and
 hustled up leaving the turn, put to drive five wide top stretch, came in couple paths trying to get by stubborn BEAUTIFUL WIFE, edged clear in final
 sixteenth. BEAUTIFUL WIFE made move between rivals to take over lead just after opening quarter, widened advantage moving through the turn then
 showed signs of fatigue while challenged by SAVANNA ROXANNA at head of lane, found more in reserve and kept on stubbornly to end, finished well clear
 over rest. SIERRA LEONA stalked through the backstretch then came under ride in the turn, put to drive along outside at head of the lane, was no match for
 pulling away top pair, secured share. CASUAL CARO was off step slow and continued slow into stride, hustled up along inside at head of lane to no avail.
 SHEZ A GREAT ONE grew fractious in the gate, began to take closer order along rail in initial sixteenth, lacked racing room along rail when eventual winner
 took path, steadied then angled out, retreated early. DRINKS ON ME took the lead in opening stages then lost top spot to beautiful wife shortly after,
 continued up close along outside then failed to sustain bid and retreated in the turn. MISS LOTUS FLOWER was not asked for much, trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 TOWNIE quickly took command inside being chased by PUT THE HAT BACK and ASKED AND ANSWERED, spurted away from his pursuers in upper
 stretch, and widened steadily under a drive. DOMENIC was boxed in behind the pacesetter late on the turn, got room on the fence when the winner left
 everyone behind turning for home, and finished gamely to get the place. PUT THE HAT BACK chased TOWNIE from the two-path, was unable to keep up
 with that one by the top of the lane, dug in outside DOMENIC but lost the place after a long drive. REPETITIOUS was outsprinted to the turn two wide,
 swung out to the four-path approaching the stretch and could not gain. STUN lacked early speed inside and was never a factor. ASKED AND ANSWERED
 ducked out hitting the side of the gate at the start, chased three wide to the end of the turn and gave way. COPPER VESSEL was away slowly after a
 stutter-step start, and trailed three wide.

 Footnotes
 RUNAWAY POSSE broke well then angled inside then two wide to save ground in first turn, switched out couple paths and raced under slight restraint to sit
 back off pace, confidently ridden still unasked three furlongs out, let out notch and edged up bit closer midway through far turn, shifted to outside position,
 given cue, set down driving six wide under left handed drive, continued gaining on late leader, got by in time to prevail. ROYAL BLESSING was positioned
 well settled near midpack racing three to four wide, steadily inched way up closer in far turn, shaken up four wide at head of lane, vied three deep for lead,
 put to drive, moved by then got caught in final strides, cleared rest for second best. CREAKY CRICKET showed speed at the start and pulled while being
 reined back to race off leader, tracked up close through the backstretch then challenged SMALL FORTUNE in far turn, briefly held narrow lead then vied
 upper stretch, was no match for top pair but kept on, dug in and held share. TWO STEP TIME stalked the top pair running through the backstretch, moved
 up closer and raced inside of ROYAL BLESSING midway through far turn, responded when called upon, vied between rivals in upper stretch, could not kick
 on with top pair nearing eighth pole, kept on for show, lost position in final stride. MY POINT EXACTLY raced three to four wide in the first turn, rated in
 range going through the backstretch, roused for more in final turn, lacked needed kick to move on. BLACKJACK BABY raced in contention, roused for more,
 responded evenly and failed to move on. ADVENTIST was well reserved racing in back, saved ground then angled out, put to drive along outside at head of
 lane, failed to kick on. SMALL FORTUNE sped to lead at the start, angled in from outside position, continued on top with CREAKY CRICKET not far behind,
 challenged by rival in far turn, could not sustain bid, retreated.

 Footnotes
 CAMILA PRINCESS was away slowly after breaking outward, moved up three wide into the far turn, joined the leaders from the outside in upper stretch,
 hooked up in a duel with BEACH WALTZ for the final furlong and prevailed near the wire. BEACH WALTZ rated along on the lead inside, responded when
 challenged through midstretch and resisted gamely before yielding in the closing yards. MIZ MAYHEM chased outside MIZ MAYHEM heading into the first
 turn, backed off opting to stalk from inside up the backstretch, remained on the rail for the drive and could not quicken with the top two. SOLDIERS PRIDE
 unseated her rider while fractious prior to loading, broke outward bothering TRINI PLEASURE, settled off the pace two wide for six furlongs, shifted out a bit
 further turning for home and made no headway. LISA LIMON saved ground early, bid three wide around the far turn, then faded through the stretch. GIFT
 OF GLORY broke alertly but was soon gathered back, saved ground to the end of the backstretch, swung widest leaving the far turn and lacked a response.
 TRINI PLEASURE shied away from SOLDIERS PRIDE at the start, recovered to chase BEACH WALTZ three then two wide, and had nothing left past the
 quarter-pole.

 Footnotes
 NIKKI'S CAUSE came away in good order and saved ground early, tracked the leaders in the clear up the backstretch and two wide to the far turn, shifted
 outside when given her cue passing the quarter-pole, quickly drew clear after catching the leaders, then had enough to repel SPICY NELLY in the final
 stages. SPICY NELLY saved ground for six furlongs, moved off the inside rallying into the lane, bid inside the winner with ample room through the last
 sixteenth and was inching closer late. FOUR K'S settled in the middle of the pack two wide early, moved four wide coming off the far turn to loom a threat,
 and kept on with good courage outside the top two to narrow the gap. FABRIANA broke slowly, raced three wide on the turns and finished evenly.
 MADDY'S SALSA forced the pace outside PAINTED ON JEANS, wrested a short lead on the far turn, fought on to upper stretch and weakened inside. L. A.
 HOUSE lacked room and steadied rankly between horses two wide approaching the first turn, saved ground thereafter and was no factor. CHARMING KID
 was slow into stride and three wide around the first turn, shifted to the two-path after that and was outrun. CROWN OF JOY trailed inside early, raced three
 wide on the far turn and failed to gain. PUPUTOV had an inside trip and was always outrun. PAINTED ON JEANS set the early pace inside, dueled with
 MADDY'S SALSA through the far turn and gave way in the lane.

 Footnotes
 FLY SO HIGH drifted in couple paths step after start, lost position, steadied slightly then angled outside and continued rated through early stages, picked up
 pace leaving the backstretch, challenged MY FAVORITE GIFT for the lead, dueled along outside then moved away a furlong out, widened advantage under
 mild drive. MY FAVORITE GIFT held narrow lead out of the chute, steadily moved in closer from outside position, set the pace through the backstretch then
 challenged for lead by FLY SO HIGH three furlongs out, fought back gamely from inside, could not move on with rival in final furlong, cleared rest for second
 best. WEEKEND MISCHIEF raced up close in opening stages then weakened losing position past the half mile marker, was no match for top pair but
 continued steady two wide bid in lane, regained show. BERNADETTA stalked and saved ground running through the backstretch, came under ride in the
 turn, was no match for top pair but kept along two to three wide, weakened, lost share and cleared the rest. PROSPECTIVE DIVA raced in range three wide
 in backstretch, could not keep pace in the turn, had no late response. ALLIYA'S STORY raced in or near the back along inside, shifted out five wide late
 backstretch, failed to move on. MISS KATIE BUG moved out widest midway through backstretch and failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 OURS AGAIN was allowed to settle well off the pace, came two wide off the far turn looking for room, found a seam in the three-path coming to the furlong
 grounds, and was up late from between horses. CHANGING LEADS settled into good position just off the early leaders inside, came out three wide turning
 for home, rallied to a short lead in deep stretch, then was overtaken by the winner and just saved the place. KING MAURO saved ground for six furlongs
 toward the back, began moving three wide coming off the far turn, shifted out further and was steadily gaining on the far outside to just miss the runner-up
 spot. RORY raced in midpack early, slipped through a tight opening on the fence to grab the lead inside TIDE OF THE DESERT in upper stretch, and was
 overtaken after the rider lost the whip just past the furlong marker. GRAN CHIEF was slow into stride, trailed to the far turn inside, fanned out four or five
 wide to upper stretch bumping with GRAN SAMAN, and was gaining late outside. BODHI DOG prompted the pace outside TIDE OF THE DESERT, came
 four wide off the far turn, gave way in midstretch and was taken in hand late. WORD ON THE STREET raced in striking range three wide for six furlongs
 and tired. TIDE OF THE DESERT set the pace inside, drifted off the rail turning for home and was overrun from both sides near midstretch. GRAN SAMAN
 was five wide early, moved closer to the inside up the backstretch, swung out wide again and was done after bumping with GRAN CHIEF in upper stretch.
 MONGOLIAN PARTY moved in from the four-path around the first turn to be two wide much of the way, raced inside through the lane and did not factor. EL
 CHAVAL was slow into stride four then three wide around the first turn, saved ground after that and remained well back. GODS GREATNESS raced four
 wide to the first turn, then tired and dropped back around the far turn three wide. Run-up distance unavailable.
