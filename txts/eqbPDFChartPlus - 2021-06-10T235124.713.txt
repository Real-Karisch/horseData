 took over and drove well clear under steady pressure. PLEASANT BUFFY off a step slow, moved closer before a half, put a head in front in the second turn,
 proved no match for the winner the final furlongs, held the place late. K P ANNA pulled early when forwardly placed inside of traffic into and through the first
 turn, continued to save ground, steadied then fell back when lacking room into the far turn, came again with a bid for the place late, outfinished for that
 position, clear of the others. BEANIE'S BABY pressured the pace for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. CREOLE WILDFIRE within striking distance the
 middle half, also came up empty for the drive. LABRUNA narrowly set the pace for a half while along thew inside, gave way when headed far turn.
 TENACIOUS FAITH sluggish from the start, trailed far back, eased in hand stretch, jogged in.

 Footnotes
 TAKING CHARGE last to leave, void of early foot toward the inside, continued to lag second turn, rallied through traffic, steered out slightly and kicked down
 the leader late. G. A. BETTING settled off the pace, began to advance on the leader midway on the final turn off the inside, collared that rival past the
 furlong marker, led late but could not contain the winner while drifting slightly. UDOKNOWJACK lacked speed while racing wide, continued widest through
 the final turn and into the lane, mild rally to finish clear of the rest. HE'S A LADY TAMER broke on top, set a modest pace along the inside, weakened when
 confronted in the drive. DUJAC closest to the leader for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. LIP SERVICE settled off the pace, lacked a response in the
 drive. GANGES raced in mid pack for a half, finished early.

 and drove clear. L L L COLLEGE FUND took command soon after the start, showed the way into the turn, clear when straightened for home, proved no
 match for the winner late, remained clear for the place. YOU COULD BE MINE forced in the start to be last away, raced back, moved out, rallied five wide
 out of the turn to finish well clear of the others while unable to get to the top two late. SALUTE ELLE went evenly in lacking a closing response.
 SCREAMING PRIDE forwardly placed for three furlongs, also lacked a closing punch. I MAID MY POINT was never a factor. MINION MONEY veered in at
 the start to bother inner rival, was straightened to force the issue for three furlongs then gave way in the drive.

 THEORYINTOPRACTICE hopped at the start to be last away, raced back off the pace while saving some ground, angled out three wide exiting the final
 turn, challenged the leader nearing midstraight, put a head in front soon after and drew strongly clear under steady pressure. CHEERS TO BERTI broke
 alertly, allowed the leader to go early, raced closest to that one the middle half, took over turning for home, briefly offered resistance to the winner then
 proved no match, clearly second best. ARKANSAS MARTINI void of early foot, continued back into the far turn, rallied belatedly to annex the show while not
 a threat to the top pair. YOUVE GOT A FRIEND settled off the pace, lacked a response in the drive. SLIDERULER showed the way into the first turn,
 continued to set a lively pace until headed in the second bend when he gave way. FIRESPIKE was finished after a half.

 Footnotes
 THUNDERBERG took control just after the start, rated through a soft set of early fractions, picked up the pace when confronted into the far turn, held a
 slight advantage through that bend, increased that lead by saving ground into the straight, fought off a late bid along the rail in finding more in the waning
 strides to prove best in a determined effort. MESETA DIABLO close from the start outside, moved closer three wide into the final turn, lost some ground to
 the winner turning for home, got back to that one late, outkicked in the final strides. ERIK THE RED lacked early foot, moved closer with a four wide middle
 move, continued in the four path final turn, set down for the drive, brushed midstretch, was closing the gap on the top two late while widest of the first flight.
 WELL'S GOLD in the second flight, moved a bit closer in the three path late in the final turn, fell back into the lane, brushed with ERIK THE RED past the
 furlong marker and like that rival, was slowly closing the gap late. TIZ TOWN broke on top, pressured the winner for six furlongs, between foes into the lane
 and began to weaken, continued to give way the final furlong. A HE'S AN O'PRADO within striking distance off the inside, came on the outside in the second
 group, lacked a closing response. CASTLEDERG last away, trailed throughout in failing to menace.

 Footnotes
 CLASSIC HIGH forwardly placed from the start outside, dueled into the turn, shook off the other speed to be clear into the lane, expanded that advantage
 upper stretch, enough left to last. GREELEY'S GLACKEN raced in mid pack and inside, encountered some traffic late backstretch, again into the lane,
 dropped inside, finished willingly when clear to be getting to the winner late. FROM NOW ON back off the pace and the inside, three wide turn, closer into
 the lane four wide, best of rest. IZZY B WINN showed the way out of the chute, dueled into the turn inside the winner, weakened gradually in the run to the
 wire. RIDE lacked early foot, improved position without posing a serious threat. RELENTLESS ATTACK off the early pace outside, moved closer through
 the turn then failed to sustain that advance in the drive. BIG YANKEE chased the early pace and began to retreat before a half. ZARB'S LEAD lacked early
 foot, picked off a few tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. ROCKY TOGA forwardly placed in the early going, backed up. HOT CAJUN NIGHTS
 sluggish from the start, well back. KORBIN'S KOPY was finished early and also well beaten.
