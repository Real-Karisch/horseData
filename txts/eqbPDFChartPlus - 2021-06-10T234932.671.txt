 five wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and was gaining late. WHENBETTERTHANNOW raced in the back, bid off the rail, couldn't gain ground and
 settled for show. COAST IS CLEAR was hustled along, showed speed to the turn, fell back and finished evenly. CHERISH stalked inside, had nothing left
 for the drive and steadily faded through the stretch. ATTACK MODE was a bit rank early, taken wide and lacked a response.

 WISSAM pressed the pace three across, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled past the eighth pole, began to inch away, came in and held well under
 steady urging. DANCING ZAPPER vied inside, fell back on the turn, angled out for the drive, finished well and gained late. GRANDPA'S INDY was never far
 back, went seven wide into the stretch, lacked the needed rally and earned show. BADLY NEEDED vied to mid stretch, was crowded and checked past the
 eighth pole and dropped back. KING REZA raced outside, rallied on the second turn to loom a threat, bid and hung. ADIR offered a mild bid in an outside
 trip and improved position. I'MCOMINGTHROUGH was outrun in an even effort. MEETING IN HEAVEN was not a factor. THE GREAT LEBOWSKI was
 outrun. JOE T GARCIA'S was through after a half. The rider of BADLY NEEDED claimed foul against the rider of WISSAM for alleged interference in the
 stretch. No change was made

 POWER CORRUPT rallied three across on the turn, dueled to deep stretch and inched clear to prove best. PARCHED sprinted clear to set the pace,
 responded when challenged, dueled to the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly. JAM N ADDY chased the pace, challenged between horses on the
 backstretch, fell back on the turn and held safely for show. ELEVEN ZIP was unhurried early, bid inside on the turn and lacked the needed rally. WOOD
 MACHINE lagged early, swung five wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. CITRON KID was never far back, bid along the rail on the turn to get within
 striking distance and came up empty. PARLAY PONTI raced in close, challenged three across on the backstretch, stopped and was not urged through the
 stretch.
