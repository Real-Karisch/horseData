 Footnotes
 NEW YEAR'S WISH broke towards the outside after losing her footing springing from the starting gate, recovered and went on to dispute three wide while
 matched up with MISS IMPERIAL, moved by and tucked closer to the rail by the conclusion of the backstretch, showed the way on the turn shadowed by
 the aforementioned opponent from the outside, was in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker when finally called upon more, gave the desired
 response to remain well in the clear. MONACO PRINCESS off the inside throughout, pursued the pace two to three wide on the turn, came under stronger
 handling by the five-sixteenths pole, was worked into path four with some left side stick work during the early stages of the stretch run, rallied well enough to
 procure the place. MISS IMPERIAL vied with the winner from path two for over a half, gave way. DARIA'S ANGEL stayed along the inside route after the
 start, got roused at the five-sixteenths marker, stepped into the stretch and faltered. MIDNIGHT DISGUISE sluggish until the end of the bend, travelled three
 wide on the turn, got sent out into path five spinning into the lane, ventured onward as the widest of all beginning from the half mile pole having never made
 her presence felt.

 Footnotes
 BALON ROSE established the front shortly after the start and showed the way crossing to the two path into the opening bend, settled into a comfortable
 rhythm in hand tucking inside at the nine-sixteenths and was patiently handled until set down near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch,
 drifted out under a near sided stick safely in front a furlong from home, dug in and held well to prevail. OCEAN FIRE tracked the pace along the inside from
 the pocket, got let out spinning three then two wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. SMACK saved ground just off the pace, was taken
 in hand and steadied off the heels of the aforementioned foe near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home roused for the stretch drive and kept on
 to secure the show honors. TAKE TEN saved ground near the rear of the field, tipped out three to four wide at the three-eighths and came under coaxing
 five-sixteenths from home, went eight wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. TAPIT TO RIDE forwardly placed two to three wide, came under
 coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SOUL KITCHEN saved ground near the rear of
 the field early on, advanced to mid pack down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
 upper stretch, offered up a mild bid, couldn't sustain the move flattening out in the late going. KEEPME IN THEGAME stumbled just after the start losing
 about two lengths of momentum to the front, tracked just off the inside from mid pack until tipped three to four wide three furlongs from home, came under a
 ride five-sixteenths out, went six wide into upper stretch and made no headway. NAVASHA just off the pace two to three wide, got coaxed along with
 five-sixteenths to go, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. CHAMPAGNE DIET broke out a step at the start and was corrected, raced
 two then three wide through the first turn near the rear of the field before advancing three to four wide down the backstretch in the clear by a trio of rivals,
 tipped five wide through the far turn under coaxing, cornered seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FRITZI three wide through the first
 turn, chased two to three wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. SO GRACIOUS saved ground in mid
 pack early on, faded to the rear of the field put to coaxing three furlongs out, spun just off the inside for home and tired.

 QUALITY CHOICE away in good order, was rated along keeping watch from the pocket, remained within striking distance for over three-quarters, was put to
 a ride angling three wide into the stretch, straightened away and took off in eanest after the front runners, hitched up to them with approximately a sixteenth
 to go, out-fought them the rest of the way home, getting up at the wire to prevail. RIVER KNIGHT off to an alert beginning, glided over to the rail with the
 advantage coming up to the end of the homestretch, rated well carving out the pace, with THOMOND PARK in accompaniment out in the two path,
 continued along under the same scenerio all the way to the end of the second bend, was approaching the three-sixteenths pole when asked for a response,
 gave it, dug in with good determination defending its lead, was almost there but got nailed right at the end. DEVOTED KITTEN strung out three wide on the
 clubhouse bend, was one path nearer the rail on the subsequent one, sat reserved for the opening three-quarters, swung into action by fanning out into path
 six during the initial portion of the stretch, becoming the widest of all, had a good finish down the center of the course to earn the show. THOMOND PARK
 prompted the pacesetter from the two path, came under stronger handling in the general area of three-sixteenths marker, battled hard, in between rivals
 from around the sixteenth pole onward, weakened late. SPORT was at or near the two path in pursuit of the front runners, altered off another and into path
 five at the three-sixteenths pole, gained some ground en route for a minor slice of the pot. SPINNING KITTEN three wide on the first turn, was in path two
 and between rivals on the far turn, moved out four wide entering the stretch, flattened out in the last eighth. BAD GUY towards the inside early, was three
 wide by the second bend, angled five wide for the drive home, made no impact. SMIDGE forwardly placed three wide for six furlongs, folded. SPECTATOR
 SPORT made it over to the rail before departing the homestretch, continued along it both on the backstretch and the second bend, was under a drive cutting
 the corner into the lane, lacked the needed response. MY AMANJENA three wide on both turns, failed to menace. DECADENCE two wide and in midpack
 during the opening phases, raced four wide on the far turn, was through by the quarter pole and backed away readily.

 FREUDIAN SIP five paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to striking range nearing the
 five-sixteenths when placed to coaxing, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths and came inwards shaking
 away to a safe lead a furlong out, then drew clear kept to task to the finish. ELIOS MILOS broke in at the start and was corrected, chased just off the inside,
 tucked briefly to the rail near the half mile pole and was taken in hand in tight briefly inside of LUCKY BET, got out once in the far turn slipping to the two
 path at the seven-sixteenths and pinching back LUCKY BET before floating INDIAN GHOST to the four path three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper
 stretch under a drive, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. TIZANOXBOW got bumped at the start
 by CALL THE CAT who shied out under hustling due to pressure from BUSTIN MACH FOUR, showed the way briefly five paths off the inside before tucking
 four then three wide down the backstretch while under some pressure inside from BUSTIN MACH FOUR, took to the two path into the turn, came under
 coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch set down under threat from a flanking pair, got collared at the three-sixteenths,
 weakened in the final furlong while along safe for the show honors. SOMEBODY four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
 three-eighths briefly angling to the three then two path before tipping out four wide into upper stretch, then improved position by tired rivals in the drive.
 BUSTIN MACH FOUR broke out at the start floating out CALL THE CAT, came under coaxing and led briefly before prompting the pace of TIZANOXBOW
 along his inside from the two path, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, tired
 through the final furlong. CALL THE CAT shied out at the start in reaction to the aforementioned foe and bumped TIZANOXBOW, chased three then four
 wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. UNION WISE five wide in pursuit, came under
 coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. LUCKY BET three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path near
 the half mile pole, got floated out three wide at the seven-sixteenths and was pinched out between foes as ELIOS MILOS drifted out along his inside, took to
 the inside put to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. INDIAN GHOST coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly
 placed four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn, got floated back four wide at the three-eighths when under coaxing as ELIOS MILOS

 Footnotes
 SEDUCER put to a firm hold after a clean getaway, moved down along the inside route with control by the end of run along the short chute, rated kindly
 setting the pace, with AZIZA in attendance in the two path, spun into the stretch, was past the three-sixteenths marker when called upon for more, extended
 the lead, was still comfortably in the clear when geared down for the last seventy yards. LUCK MONEY tracked the winner from the pocket, got cued up
 angling to the outside after six furlongs had been rattled off, stepped onto the head of the stretch from path two, finished with some willingness, but proved
 no match today. BOOM BOOM GIRL took the inside route, was sighted pulling with some force on the bit during the early going, went into the stretch, failed
 to threaten the top twosome, stayed on for the show. HARVEY'S LIL GOIL strung out three wide on both turns, got sent out into path five after entering the
 stretch, mustered up a mild response sufficient enough for the final significant slice of the purse. AZIZA stalked the winner from path two for three-quarters
 and gave way. STUNNING SKY underwent a two wide pursuit to the top of the lane, improved position during the stretch run. ESPRESSOANDACHECK
 worked out a tuck into the two path coming up to the crown of the clubhouse bend, was still in it racing around the subsequent one, came into the stretch
 and backed away. FASHION RULES saved ground to no avail. YLIKEDIS lunged at the start, raced two to three wide for over three-quarters, was more the
 latter at the start of the stretch drive, came up empty. LOOK ME OVER strung out in path three on each of the bend, folded after completing three-quarters.
 SHE'SAMERICANMADE rode the rail to the quarter pole while trailing throughout.

 Footnotes
 DEVAMANI (FR) got bumped at the start by HAY DAKOTA recovering from a bobble and then got brushed by AQUAPHOBIA, tracked just off the inside
 early on before taking to the pocket along the inside midway down the backstretch, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, scraped the paint into upper
 stretch roused, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in knocking heads through to the finish and prevailed gamely on the wire with the nod
 of his head. DREAM FRIEND established the front crossing to the two path into the first turn, showed the way settled into a comfortable rhythm just off the
 inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive and was headed a furlong out,
 fought on gamely to the finish but lost the bob on the wire. INSTILLED REGARD settled just off the inside in mid pack, remained patiently handled until let
 out spinning just off the inside for home, began to tip out from the two path nearing the sixteenth marker while closing well to threaten the top pair late and
 missed on the wire having tipped out five to six paths through to the finish. FLAVIUS got away to an awkward beginning a beat slow, settled just off the
 inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths and remained patiently handled then cut the corner paused into upper stretch in
 behind DEVAMANI, got roused briefly at the three-sixteenths and paused once more at the eighth pole inside of INSTILLED REGARD before commencing
 encouragement inside that station, offered up a mild bid to secure the last major share. AQUAPHOBIA broke in at the start brushing DEVAMANI, settled just
 off the pace two to three wide before tucking along the inside with seven-sixteenths to run, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the
 inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, then flattened out in the late stages. NINETY ONE ASSAULT four wide into the first turn,
 tucked to the two path by midway, tracked two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch
 and made no late headway. LEMONIST two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four
 wide into upper stretch and offered no response while passing tired foes. RAPT three wide through the first turn, chased four wide under coaxing from the
 three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. HAY DAKOTA bobbled at the break recovering into DEVAMANI, was steadied in tight
 inside of FLAVIUS into the firs turn, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper
 stretch and was unable to make an impact. STRIKE ME DOWN five wide into the first turn, tucked three wide through that bend before chasing three wide
 down the backstretch from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened. ANOTHER four then
 three wide through the opening bend, chased three then two wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
 upper stretch and tired. WESTERLAND (GB) three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide in closest aim of the front, got coaxed along at the
 five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired.

 Footnotes
 SAGUARO ROW well off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from the four path, cruised up to the front runners after the second split had been
 posted, came under a ride for drive home, chopped away at the deficit in a steadfast manner, struck the front end with approximately a sixteenth remaining
 and drove clear. PHILANTHROPIC got engaged with LAST TRUE LOVE just about from the start, was in path two pulling a bit on the left while vying with
 that opponent, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and got switched over to stronger handling, got reeled in right around the sixteenth pole, held on for
 the place. PINK SANDS took up the chase from path two on the turn, got sent out into path five after spinning off it, rallied for the show. LAST TRUE LOVE
 sparred for the top three wide until upper stretch before giving way. MAJESTIC REASON stalked the pace from midpack in the two path, commenced the
 stretch sligthtly wider, lacked a response. HONOR WAY faltered off a ground-saving journey. GOLCONDA (FR) hustled on the chute to attain a forward
 position, kept watch on the front runners from path three on the turn, swung into the lane and folded.

 CURLIN'S HONOR got bumped at the start by GIDU who recovered inwards from a stumble and pinched back JUST HOWARD between foes, settled just
 off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside at the three-eighths placed to coaxing, spun just off the inside for home before darting to the rail
 straightened away, rallied up the inside to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking narrow command just inside the sixteenth marker, tussled
 gamely to the finish to prevail on the wire by a hard fought neck. CARIBOU CLUB tracked the pace along the inside leading the second flight in behind the
 top quartet who spurted away early on, tipped to the two path three furlongs from home advancing with the remainder of the field on that top foursome, spun
 just off the inside for home, got roused when getting a seam straightened away and rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under threat to
 the inside coming over to look that rival in the eye and was headed inside the sixteenth pole, fought on head to head to the finish clear of the rest for the
 place honors. FRONTIER MARKET settled two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into
 upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. JUST HOWARD got pinched at the start by CURLIN'S HONOR due to pressure from
 GIDU, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and
 offered up a mild bid. GOLDEN BROWN two to three wide in pursuit from the second flight, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths as the field
 condensed, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, couldn't sustain the move and flattened out in the final furlong.
 VOODOO SONG coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace of ABIDING STAR to the inside slipping away in concert with that rival as well as GIDU and DR.
 EDGAR as a foursome from the rest of the field, had the field condense through the far turn and poked a head in front before spinning just off the inside into
 upper stretch roused, dug in under threat and relinquished the front nearing the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. GIDU (IRE) stumbled at the start
 recovering into CURLIN'S HONOR, raced forwardly placed just off the inside in behind the top pair through the first turn and down the backstretch tracking
 in tandem with DR.EDGAR to his outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. DR. EDGAR forwardly
 placed three wide through the first turn, tracked in aim of the top pair three then four wide, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, swung five
 wide into upper stretch and tired. ABIDING STAR came under coaxing just after the start to be forwardly placed just off VOODOO SONG into the first turn,
 took over command narrowly midway on that bend and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from that rival to the inside down
 the backstretch, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and the pressure intensified, got headed near that station and swung three to four wide for
 home, then faltered in the stretch.

 JACK AND NOAH (FR) grabbed the advantage shortly after the start and cut over to the rail, was lightly hand urged leading the way, prompted by TURNED
 ASIDE from the outside, made it to the three-sixteenths marker and was turned loose, departed the eighth pole in possesson of its largest lead, ventured
 onward chased by a hoarde but dug in well to stay in the clear. EMBOLDEN bumped with MONTAUK DADDY in the shadow of the starting gate, worked out
 a tuck aong the inside route in time for the run around the bend, stepped into the stretch, altered course into path three at the three-sixteenths pole, fought
 on with good courage to win the place. SO STREET rated in the pocket keeping an eye on the front runners, got cued up for the stretch run, inched its way
 to the outside, failed to dent into the margin much in the final furlong, held on well enough to secure the show. ME AND MR. C took up the chase from two
 path on the turn, swung out into path six for clearance into the stretch, closed in to earn the last major check. OLD CHESTNUT got set up along the rail after
 the field had been sent off and running, was on hold prior to cutting the corner into the lane, made some headway en route for a minor slice of the pot.
 MONTAUK DADDY darted over to the rail after making some contact with EMBOLDEN right after the start, took it for the opening half, angled out six wide
 entering the stretch, mustered up a mild response . TURNED ASIDE prompted the winner from the two path, was let out in the vicinity of the
 three-sixteenths pole, failed to keep up and backed away. FLY FLY AWAY forwardly placed while stationed in the three path, was put to a drive as the half
 was being completed, went into the stretch and gave way. MYSTIC LANCELOT strung out three wide on the turn, had no rally. FREEWHEELER settled into
 midpack after the start, was in path two travelling on the turn, shifted out four wide into the lane, came up empty. PRINCE OF THIEVES two wide onto the
 turn, was sent five wide exiting it, failed to menace. AXIOMO pursued the pace from path two in midpack, commenced the stretch one path farther off the
 rail, folded.

 rallied to poke a head in front a furlong out, came out bumping ONWARD inside that station before edging clear to the finish kept to task. ONWARD vied
 from the four path early on before chasing COLLOQUIST two to three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
 into upper stretch and took over command straightened away, dug in and was headed a furlong out, got bumped by TOLEDO inside that station and ran on
 to chase the winner home clear of the rest and second best. HUNT THE FRONT struck the near side stall at the start getting away last, chased just off the
 inside from the tail of the field down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled in nearing the

 from the gate, vied for command with a pair five to six paths off the inside, cleared those rivals and tucked to the two path into the turn advancing to a safe
 lead before coming under growing threat from flanking challengers, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home between
 foes and yielded command straightened away, then folded in the stretch. VERIFY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
 angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. MANOLITO bobbled at the start recovering into COLLOQUIST, raced forwardly placed seven paths off the
