 Footnotes
 TENACIOUS TRUDY broke in front and chased the leader into the turn, inherited the lead two wide near the quarter pole then widened the balance of the
 trip to win as much the best under energetic handling. EDGE OF HONOR never far back, had a mild late rally in the four path and finished clearly second
 best. TEAM HALO trailed into the stretch then found her best stride late in the three path. ANSWER QUIETLY failed to menace. PYRITE SLEW well
 placed,inside, lacked the needed response. PAT'S WILL sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for nearly a half then
 stopped. SARAYA hopped at the start, was never close and stopped in the lane.

 Footnotes
 PATTY'S MISCHIEF broke in front and set a pressured pace along the rail for four and one half furlongs, gave up the lead, dropped back and angled two
 wide midway on the far turn, came on again in the final stages and got back up in time. ELOQUENT ETHEL slow early, closed with a burst of speed in the
 five path through the stretch and got up for second. HEATHERFROMPHOENIX pressed the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, made the lead
 and angled inside, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. DANCE ELECTRIC well placed, offered a strong bid along the rail in mid stretch
 then lacked the needed racing room. LAINEY LUCK void of early speed, found her best stride late in the five path. CHOCOLATE CANDY was no threat.
 ROAN FEATHERS was no factor. GRAN CHAMA had speed three wide and was through after a half.
