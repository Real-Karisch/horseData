 Footnotes
 HIP HOP stalked outside a rival, edged up in upper stretch, shifted in approaching the eighth pole, closed under left handed rousing and to the inside of
 SCARFREE, took over with about a sixteenth remaining and drew clear. SCARFREE was sent up three wide between rivals and took command, kicked
 clear and set the pace off the inside, was confronted from the inside nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. HOT FRIESIA , off the pace and
 two wide into the lane, swung out leaving the three sixteenths and closed steadily. STETSON GOLD had speed between foes then secured the rail while
 chasing, raced to the inside of the winner into the lane, lacked a kick past the eighth pole and faded. STAKES ON A PLANE broke a step slow, raced off the
 pace while saving ground, eased out in the drive and had a mild kick. BACCARAT FASHION saved ground with early pursuit, dropped back mid turn, eased
 out late but lacked a bid. SNIPPETY was hustled up soon after the break, chased three wide and gave way in mid stretch. MARIE FROM PARIE was
 steadied when in close at the break, recovered in the opening sixteenth, circled the turn four wide but failed to rally. FANNIEBELLEFLEMING was outrun.

 Footnotes
 SEEKING THE SUNSET gained a forward position despite trying to wander outward into the first turn, corrected and was patiently handled tracking the
 leaders towards the fence, eased out leaving the far turn and had dead aim past the five sixteenths, shifted four wide and responded when asked entering
 the stretch, forged past the dueling leaders in mid stretch and eagerly drew away under left handed rousing. DASHING LOU , between rivals early, edged
 up to set his sights on the duelers into the far turn, bid three wide, vied outside HE'S ONE WILD DUDE past the quarter pole, exchanged a brush with that
 one soon into the lane, could not resist the winner in mid stretch but kept on gamely to the line. HE'S ONE WILD DUDE prompted to the outside of DOUBLE
 WHAMMY early on, put a head in front around the far turn, secured inside while dueling past the quarter pole, made contact with DASHING LOU entering
 the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. MY OWN LANE , unhurried early, angled out for the drive and had a mild kick. BRICKYARD KITTEN settled in
 the clear while off of a contested pace, moved up some into the far turn, angled out under a ride in upper stretch but came up empty. DOUBLE WHAMMY
 broke a bit awkwardly, rushed up between foes and gained a short lead in the opening furlong, set a pressured pace along the rail, ceded command around
 the far turn, was under a ride trying to maintain a forward position approaching the stretch then weakened. STARRY MESSENGER raced without front
 shoes, stalked the leaders four wide, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and faltered.

 SOUPER ECHO tracked three wide under a light hold, took closer order soon into the lane, responded when shaken up near the three sixteenths, forged
 clear of the leader nearing the eighth pole, kept on under a drive and held firm. SILVER SLIVERS rated off the pace, came three wide for the drive and
 finished well. ELEVATED VISION settled off the pace while removed from the rail, came three wide into the lane, angled out in mid stretch and rallied mildly.
 MADAME X. lagged off the pace, swung six wide for the drive and rallied. FINDING PERFECTION rated towards the inside, eased out in upper stretch,
 moved up slightly then faded in the final sixteenth. OFF MY STAGE angled five wide and lacked a bid. MS EILEEN broke a step slow, rushed clear from the
 outside and then dropped in, set a strong pace towards the rail, was reeled in nearing the eighth pole and weakened. BEARSATLANTICMIST saved ground
 while showing a bit of early foot then weakened.
