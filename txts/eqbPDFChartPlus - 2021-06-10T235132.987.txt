 drive, moved up then by HELEN ROSE a furlong from, widened margin under steady encouragement. HELEN ROSE vied for lead racing outside of INDIAN
 MYTH, edged away from rival leaving the backstretch, continued to lead the way entering the lane, continued driving with narrow lead the lost top spot to
 eventual winner leaving eighth pole, kept along for second best. SIMULADORA was away step slow at the start, continued in the last flight saving ground
 along rail, sent driving five wide in the lane, showed response, gained and finished well clear for share. CASUAL CARO raced in the last flight, hustled up
 three to four wide upper stretch but failed to move on. INDIAN MYTH vied for early lead racing inside of HELEN ROSE, could not match strides with rival
 leaving the backstretch but kept up close then retreated in the lane. HOLD ON EMMA raced in range off top pair, put to drive mid-turn but came up empty.

 Footnotes
 SALSA CAPUCHINO raced in tracking position off the top two leaders, shook reins then put to drive leaving the turn, steadily moved way closer to the lead,
 got by in final stride. K K'S REVOLVER dueled for lead racing inside of CAPT. OVERDRIVE, continued to battle into the lane, held narrow advantage, dug
 in gamely in late drive, got caught approaching the wire. CLEMSON AND WATSON was step slow at the start, hustled up along rail to gain closer
 contention, set driving along inside into the drive, moved up in striking distance in deep stretch but lacked needed kick to move by. CAPT. OVERDRIVE vied
 for lead racing outside of rival, continued to battle into the lane then had nothing left in reserve for deep stretch. DRAMATURGO raced in range along the
 outside, continued wide even bid through the lane. CAPE MARCO DRIVE raced off early pace, hustled up four wide upper stretch, needed more for late
 impact while finishing well clear over rest. DRIVEN TO THE MAX was keen wanting to go in early stages, raced under a hold just off inside, continued to tug
 with response still unasked then lost interest and had no further response. LUCKY CLEMEN raced near the back then three wide upper stretch to no avail.
 FORTY HITS showed early response then retreated.

 Footnotes
 RUN TIME raced three wide in first turn, was well rated through the backstretch, came under strong hand ride racing off top trio midway through far turn, put
 to drive five wide entering the lane, reached leader in late drive, got by SWAGGER JAGGER and edged away. SWAGGER JAGGER was keen while trying
 to rate off early pace, tugged wanting to do more then let out entering far turn, engaged top pair three furlongs out, continued to battle with CHARLIE MOPS
 in late drive, began to edge away while being confronted by RUN TIME, lacked closing kick to move on. CHARLIE MOPS secured rail position racing on top
 in the first turn, raced under pressure then dueled for lead racing inside of JAGGER then added challenge of SWAGGER JAGGER in far turn, fought gamely
 into deep stretch then came up empty late. JAGR quickly angled in from outside position nearing first turn, pressed pace then dueled for lead with CHARLIE
 MOPS, took on added challenge opf SWAGGER JAGGER in far turn, could not match strides at head of the lane but never gave up and kept on to wire.
 ROBUSTO stalked along rail, cut the corner entering lane then put to drive three to four wide, lacked needed kick for late impact. BEALESTREET DANCER
 raced midpack then put to drive four wide in the lane, continued steady even bid without threatening. FRONT LINE PAIGE was unhurried through the
 backstretch, roused along outside at head of the lane, needed more for late impact. BOOTLEGGER (FR) raced off the pace and failed to rally in the lane.
 ZITMAN was unhurried in early stages then failed to gain close contention in the lane. SECOND STREET raced near the back, failed to gain. MAJOR KEY
 failed to respond. SILVER BEACH had no late response.
