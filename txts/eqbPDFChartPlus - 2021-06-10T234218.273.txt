 GUSKA MON SHOES settled well, advanced on the turn, moved four wide into the stretch, responded to pressure and rallied strongly. SERENGETI stalked
 the pace, took over leaving the turn, proved no match and stayed on. JOAN'S DELIGHT saved ground, was angled off the rail into the stretch and lodged a
 mild rally. PLUMBAGO was void of speed and failed to make an impression. BIG GUY IAN gained the early lead, was headed leaving the turn and gave
 way. NEVER GIVE IN was outpaced along the inside and weakened.

 angled four wide during the stretch run and exhibited good late energy. FAIRWAYNGREEN sprinted clear, was headed leaving the turn and proved no
 match. SWEET TATUM stalked the early fractions and lacked the needed kick. PARADE OF ROSES showed little.
