 Footnotes
 VALEDICTORIETTE vied for command from the outside, dueled with PRINCESS ZENN around the turn and gained command, battled to the sixteenth pole
 and drew clear of rival under a drive. PRINCESS ZENN vied off the rail, dueled from the inside around the turn and into the stretch and could not match the
 winner in the final sixteenth. INFORM ME broke out and bumped leaving the gate, showed brief speed challenging from the inside, failed to match strides
 and chased the top pair around the turn and finished evenly in the lane. PREDOMINANCE stalked a bit off the rail, two wide around the turn and never
 produced a bid. CALI SINDY tracked from the inside, lost ground around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. LALA FLEUR bumped at the start, took
 the turn three wide and never threatened.
