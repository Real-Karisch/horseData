 Footnotes
 ROSEAU, urged to prompt the pace inside rivals racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin for a half, was headed nearing upper stretch
 but continued resolutely to regain the advantage and edged clear late under firm right handed pressure. LITTLE PATRIOT, forwardly placed three deep
 stalking just off the first flight, was prompted to challenge in that path racing into the far turn, struck the front nearing upper stretch but proved no match for
 the winner late. ROSE N MOTION, a step slow into stride, tracked off the first flight inside foes, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a mild bid
 to prevail for a share. RAGING LADY, restless in the gate, was urged to terms prompting a rival's pace in early stages, pressed the issue between foes into
 the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. WOW WOW NOW tracked off the first flight between rivals in the opening half, shifted five wide racing
 into the stretch but made no impact. SHE'S PRETTY WINDY broke slowly, settled last to the far turn and failed to menace. BRAHMIE tracked the pace
 outside rivals in the second flight racing to the backstretch but retreated early.

 WATERTONIAN, forwardly placed outside rivals tracking just off the first flight, advanced to challenge three wide on the turn, shied a bit off the pacesetter
 entering upper stretch but quickly recovered to wrest command and kick clear under firm left handed pressure. WINTERS RUN, urged to gain the lead
 inside foes, set the pace into the turn, ducked out racing into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. WANNAPLAYBIGCHIEF
 broke slowly, settled into stride, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and improved position. LINK broke outwards bumping a rival, angled inside
 while briefly gaining some position nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. LAST MINISTER tracked the leaders near the inside but made no impact.
 NOT JUSTA SOMERSET, urged three deep prompting the pacesetter into the turn, gave way in the drive. MAGIC WOLF flashed brief pace between foes
 and emptied out early. BREEZE E PRADO, bumped twice at the start, never menaced.

 MISDEED angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, shifted out on the far turn commencing a steady, four wide
 advance to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, quickly wrested the advantage while shifting to the inside and was roused clear under firm left
 handed pressure. A WE BIT FLIRTY angled in to track just off the first flight between foes in the opening half, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper
 stretch, then switched outside rivals while proving best of the others. VANDERBOOM RIDGE, urged to gain a forward placing three wide racing to the
 backstretch, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn and weakened in late stages. SKY CITY, urged to prompt the pace between foes racing to the
 backstretch, dueled inside rivals racing into the far turn and gave way entering upper stretch. SPEED IS LIFE was urged to dictate the pace on a narrow
 margin along the inside and emptied out racing into the far turn. SCATTERED CASH angled inside tracking the leaders in second flight but offered no rally.
 ALPINE GATHERING settled near the inside early and failed to menace. ARONEY was reserved outside foes in the opening half and proved no threat.
 COLONEL GOTHAM, caught four wide racing into the first turn, retreated early.
