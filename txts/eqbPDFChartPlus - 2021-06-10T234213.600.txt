 and hustled up in far turn, kept under steady urging in stretch and raced along for share. LAPULGA raced off the pace then set down driving five wide top
 stretch and passed tiring rivals. BIG DARLING took the lead in the first turn, set pressured pace through backstretch, failed to match strides through far turn
 then faded in lane. ALONG THE TRAIL raced in last flight, driving four wide upper stretch, gained position without threatening. VOILA LA VICTOIRE (IRE)

 Footnotes
 IS THAT MAGIC raced in tracking position along inside, angled out path and vied for lead mid-way in turn, shook free, drove away to clear command then
 held late under firm encouragement. LITTLE NECK unhurried in early stages then began to pick up pace in far turn, responded when put to drive top stretch
 and gained on winner to wire. TRINI PLEASURE tracked the pace through backstretch, hustled up three wide at quarter pole, continued steady bid and
 regained share. PERFECT STATE set the pace through backstretch, vied for the lead mid-way through turn then failed to move on with eventual winner and
 steadily weakened in lane. CASUAL CARO unhurried, saved ground then urged along rail into stretch but failed to kick on. BUENAMOZA raced in early
 contention then steadily retreated. TRESTE KANTA raced four to five off the pace then faltered. SONOMA STORM showed early response then dropped far
