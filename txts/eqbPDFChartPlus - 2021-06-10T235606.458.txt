 PLAY BALL chased the leader into the turn, responded readily when set down, rallied to make the lead two wide entering the stretch, opened a daylight lead
 rapidly and prevailed under a hand ride. LEO unhurried early, closed with a rush in the six path through the stretch and was steadily cutting into the winners
 advantage through the final stages. STAND ALONE DENNIS allowed to settle, swung wide and rallied belatedly in the eight path. FUNNEL CAKE passed
 tiring rivals. I AM IRON MAN broke slowly and was no threat. JUMPN' JAMES was outrun. BOWMAN was through early. MAKE THE CALL sprinted to a
 clear lead a few strides out of the gate, set the pace to the top of the stretch, altered course to the five path then stopped.
