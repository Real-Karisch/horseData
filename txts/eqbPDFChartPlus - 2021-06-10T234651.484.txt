 Footnotes
 SUMMER KING chased the pacesetter, cruised up on the far turn and bounded clear in the stretch under intermittent pressure. DOWLINGFOURTYEIGHT
 sprinted clear, was gathered up by the runaway winner on the far turn, was no match and stayed on. LIKE A COWBOY raced forwardly while three wide,
 moved three wide into the stretch and kept on. KIPPER KEY passed tired ones. ST ALBERT ABBEY settled while four wide and lacked a rally. KING JIMMY
 never menaced. BAD MOON was outpaced while four wide and no factor. COV saved ground and was never involved. SYD LICIOUS dwelt at the start and
 trailed. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BY SYD LICIOUS. IN TURN, THEY DECLARED HIM
 A STARTER.
