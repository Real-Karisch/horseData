 Footnotes
 U S CITIZEN was off very sharply to be clear in the first couple strides, settled back to track the two rival duel through the turn, moved three wide in late turn
 to challenge for the lead, was going to the front when the runner-up edged past, came again, dueled through the last fifty yards and just prevailed.
 MEANBONE chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and four wide, made the lead outside the eighth
 pole, appeared a winner approaching the sixteenth pole, was joined by the winner in deep stretch and yielded very late. SUPREME VENTURE vied for the
 lead through the turn while two wide, was inching past the dueling challenger after straightening in the lane then was no match for the top two while clear for
 the show spot. SCOOTER BUG BUG vied for the lead along the inside into the turn then gave way. BIG LEGACY was never a threat while racing near the
 rail into the lane. FUDGE PROUD never a factor while along the inside. STAY ON SHORE raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from
 the six path and never menaced.

 Footnotes
 EXPECT INDY raced along the rail through the turn, came into the lane near the inside, shifted two wide when gaining on the leader, collared that one and
 quickly cleared then widened to the wire. JILLS PASSION set the pace from near the rail through the turn on a clear lead, continued clear into the lane, was
 no match for the winner but kept on to be clear for the place spot. ARCHIE'S GIRL was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled into the
 five path into the lane when gaining momentum and moved up while not a threat to the top two. EASY DEAR stalked the pacesetter while in the two path
 through the turn, was well placed into the lane then tired approaching the eighth pole. PAIGE'S STAR raced in the four path through the turn and never was
 a factor while in mid-track through the lane. COLONIAL JILL chased the pace from the three path through the turn, remained in a good spot into the lane
 then was empty after straightening. FRAN'S RANSOM was done after going a half while saving ground. CITY SEDUCTION was in position early while
 approaching the turn while in the four path, began to lose ground in mid-turn and continued to fade through the lane.

 lane and could not gain on the top two while finishing best of the rest. STATESBORO vied for the lead along the inside into mid-turn, could not keep up with
 the winner and weakened through the lane. RIO BUENO was never a factor while racing near the inside to the three path through the turn. JUST OLD

 Footnotes
 ARISTOMACHES was void of early speed, came off the inside into the far turn, came into the lane five wide with momentum, continued with good energy
 straightening in the lane, caught the leader inside the eighth pole, dueled with that one and inched up. PLAINFIELD chased the pace from the three path
 through the turn, bid with the show rival while three wide, gained the lead just inside the eighth pole, dueled with the winner to the wire and was just denied.
 UPHOLD tracked the pacesetter while in the two path, bid two wide into the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole, lost the advantage inside the
 furlong pole and slowly yielded. BIZERK tracked the pace along the inside, had first run on the pacesetter in late turn and into the lane and could not offer
 the needed response. SLICKLY DONE was along the inside though mid-turn, came off the rail into the lane and moved up while not a threat. DEVIL'S DUE
 WEST was in the three or four path through the far turn and never was a serious menace. SIR BROGAN was never a factor while negotiating the turns in
 the two path. HUCKLEBERRY HILL raced along the inside while on a clear lead into the lane then folded up along the rail.

 WHEREWEGOIN led inside, went clear in the stretch and lasted under steady urging. TWOBIRDSONESTONE was unrushed early, raced four wide in the
 stretch and rallied late. I WILL STAND stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole, then faltered late. BARTLETT HALL pulled inside
 throughout, lacking room, angled three wide at the eighth pole, but then had no bid. DARKNSTORMYTIME saved ground and improved position late.
 UNCLE PADDY passed tired foes outside. AIR WONDERFUL and LET IT GO INDIGO faded. MICHAELS TARNATION pressed the pace outside of the

 early inside, then yielded. AUCTION LIGHT raced in the three path, bid at the quarter pole, then faltered late. E Z MAN BAND stalked the pace in the four
 path, then had no late bid. CRIMSON BANDIT was squeezed back at the start, then had a mild late bid. NOT E Z BEINGGREEN raced in the five path with
 no late bid. FAR'S OUTLAW saved ground. PROFESSIONAL ROPER and VREELAND were not factors. WAR ON RED stalked the pace between foes
