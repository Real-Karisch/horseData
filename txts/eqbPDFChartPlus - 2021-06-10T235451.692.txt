 Footnotes
 ZECHA at a considerable distance from off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from the three path, was the outerrmost of a group consisting of
 three in pursuit of the unattended leader, got asked to pick it up right after the half had been completed, swung one path farther off the rail into the stretch,
 chopped away at the deficit, continued along in workman-like fashion to prove best in the final sixteenth. DAZZLING SPEED cut over to the inside after
 establishing control in short order, showed the way on an open lead, got turned loose when challenged by the winner in the general area of the
 three-sixteenths pole, relinquished a furlong later, held the place. TAYLER'S THE BOSS tracked the pacesetter from along the inside route, tiipped into the
 two path stepping onto the top of the lane, narrowed in, missed out on second. MAZMANIA took up the chase from the two path, went about its busiiness
 from between rivals from the five-sixteenths pole to midlane before weakening. JAZZY J was checked after breaking to the outside, saw the pilot squeeze
 the reins once again shortly afterwards getting taken back to the rear of the pack, gradually made her way into path two, got driven six wide into the lane,
 becoming the widest of all, had no rally.

 Footnotes
 HONEY GRAEME broke out at the start and was corrected, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from
 JUMP FOR JOY to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, took to the inside straightened
 away, shied out under a near sided stick a furlong from home, dug in and shied in under an off sided stick with seventy yards to the finish forcing TIMELY
 TRADITION to steady and alter late and held safe to prevail. TIMELY TRADITION chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
 spun just off the inside for home, tipped out a path at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive, had the aforementioned foe shy in with seventy yards to go
 and steadied before altering out to just last on the wire for the place honors. AUNT BABE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
 angled five wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. HAY FIELD just off the inside in pursuit early on, tipped four wide through the turn
 coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. JUMP FOR JOY four then three wide prompting the
 leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. CHORUS LINE chased three wide down
 the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout. There
 was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on HONEY GRAEME in deep stretch as well as a Jockey's objection lodged by the rider of TIMELY TRADITION alleging
 interference in deep stretch. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result stood prior to the race being declared official.

 Footnotes
 CHANNEL ISLAND rated along keeping watch on the front runners from the two path, was gradually maneuvered into the three path after departing the
 backstretch, came under a drive nearing the quarter pole, inched up to the ones to catch, kicked into his best with approximately a sixteenth remaining,
 wearing down OVERBOLD in the shadow of the finish line to prove best. OVERBOLD grabbed the advantage soon after the start, cut over to the inside,
 was well rated carving out the pace, accompanied by SEA MIST to the outside, ventued onward under the identical set up all the way to the quarter pole,
 setlted into at the top of the lane then had the pilot go to work, fended off SEA MIST only to get confronted by the top one late, was determined to the end
 but wound up releasing the lead with about two jumps left to go. SEA MAST was coaxed along in path two path prompting the pace, got turned loose at the
 three-sixteenths pole, put up a solid challenge over the course of the next furlong, wasn't able to claim the front end, held on belatedly to salvage the show.
 FELIX THE FOX took up positon in midpack after the field had been sent off and running, was in path three loosely drafting behind the winner during the run
 around the second bend, tipped into the four path for the drive home, narrowed in, fell short of snagging third. BETTER TAPIT pocketed until the quarter
 pole, was asked for more shifting out two wide onto the top of the lane, lacked the needed response. THIRD EDITION fidgeting about in its stall, shouldered
 the right side of the gate hard after leaping up at the start, was patiently ridden and allowed to settle into stride, took up the chase at or near the two path,
 had no rally. BRIDGETOTHEFUTURE sent over to the rail on the backstretch after being mostly two wide prior, failed to menace.

 way in hand three wide down the backstretch through moderate splits, tucked inside half a mile from home, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in
 under a drive getting collared near the sixteenth pole, then got outfinished in the late going. PURE PRAISE bumped at the start by DANGEROUS WOMAN

 Footnotes
 MISS PEPPINA gradually made her way into the two path on the backstretch, was well rated taking up the chase on the turn, flashed some interest coming
 up to the end of the bend, got cued up getitng sent to outside after stepping into the stretch, paused behind a shifting PALACE AVENGER before settling
 into the six path herself at the three-sixteenths pole, took off after the ones to catch, wrested away the advantage with approximately a sixteenth to go and
 edged away. AVUNCULAR underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, got set down leaving the five-sixteenths marker, angled slightly wider into the
 stretch, forged to a slim lead deep into the furlong grounds, got collared by the top one about a sixteeenth later, held on well to save second. TALK YOU
 OUT OF IT strung out four wide on the turn, fanned out into path seven from upper to midstretch, rallied with some willingness for the show. PALACE
 AVENGER took up position in midpack after being hustled out of the starting gate, was kept to some light hand urging riding the rail on the turn, got asked
 for more getting moved out five wide during the first half of the stretch run, rallied mildly, but without impact. CRITICAL DECISION chased the pace from the
 two path on the turn, was set down at the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch slightly wide, gave way. OUR DIXIE BLUE set up in the two path after
 the start, went on to dispute the pace matched up with BEAUTIFUL AMAILA, saw the rider switch over to a brisk hand ride after putting away the nemesis in
 the vicinity of the five-sixteentsh pole, came under pressure a littie while later, relinquished a short distance from the eighth pole then backed away.
 POSITIVE POWER two wide onto the turn, got sent seven wide exiting it, failed to make her presence felt. BEAUTIFUL AMAILA along the inside route
 sparring for command to the five-sixteenths pole, folded. PATERSON was put to a brisk hand ride after breaking the tardiest, raced three wide on the turn,
 was still as wide entering the turn, made no bids.

 remained patiently handled shaking away and went just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused near the three-sixteenths, drew clear under a drive to
 prevail. CREATIVE STYLE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the

 Footnotes
 LUCULLAN took up residence in the three path after the field had been sent off and running, vied as the widest of three for the lead, got set down spinning
 into the stretch, fought his way to the front end during the ensuing furlong, kept going on with good energy and edged away. NOBLE INDY retained the
 advantage after breaking on top, was guided over to the inside route, showed the way, feeling the presence of rivals out in paths two and three respectively,
 was the first of that threesome to have its pilot commit to a drive, this occurring a short distance from the end of the second bend, was headed deep into the
 furlong grounds, proved determined to the wire but had to settle for the place. THERAPIST prompted the pace in path two from between opponents, got
 turned loose stepping onto the head of the stretch, fought onward until the sixteenth pole before weakening. FORCE THE PASS tracked the front runners
 from a slight distance from off the rail, was worked into path four from upper to midstretch, made no headway. MARAUD sighted two wide and fighting the
 bit for much of the journey leading up to the conclusion of the backstretch, went over to the inside at the half mile pole, got cued up swinging three wide into
 the lane, lacked a solid closing punch. HARLAN'S HARMONY strung out four wide on the clubhouse bend, took up its pursuit two to three wide on the
 subseqeuent one, came into the lane and weakened.
