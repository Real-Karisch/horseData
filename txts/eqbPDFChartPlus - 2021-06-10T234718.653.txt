 Footnotes
 SUPPORT OUR CAUSE broke on top and remained forwardly placed, stalked the leader from path three, crept up to increase its presence after stepping
 onto the turn, was yet being held in reserve drawing up abreast of PLATINUM NUGGET as the half was being completed, swung slightly wider into the lane
 lightly hand urged, came in slightly after being called upon for more in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, got quickly corrected, edged away to
 begin the last eighth leading by his largest margin, held on late to fend off the second place finisher. FLAT OUT JAYVIEN away without apparent mishap,
 gradually made his way to the inside route, kept watch on the front runners, was put to a drive shortly after the half had been completed, fanned out into
 path five spinning into the stretch, becoming the widest of all, closed in well late, but came up short. CREATIVE STYLE pressed the issue towards the two
 path, was one path farther off the rail coming into the stretch, steadied getting pinched in the vicinity of three-sixteenths pole, recovered and mustered up a
 mild response to claim the show. PLATINUM NUGGET showed the way, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, came under heavier pressure as the
 second split was being finalized, was in the process of getting displaced when set down a sixteenth down the road, began the stretch more in the two path
 than before, failed to keep pace with the top one and weakened. LINNS BOY off a bit slowly, trailed throughout while undergoing a ground-saving journey,
 Following a claim of foul lodged by the rider of CREATIVE STYLE against the rider of SUPPORT OUT CAUSE alleging interference in the area of the
 three-sixteenths marker, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official. All riders carried an additional two pounds as mandated by a
 weather-related safety initiative.

 Footnotes
 FREE KITTY ranged up after the start to vie between foes from the six path down the backstretch, inherited the front at the nine-sixteenths, tucked inside at
 the half mile pole, came under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide at that station, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
 and held safe to prevail. SMILES FROM SADIE six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased five wide through the turn coming under
 coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to be along well clear of the rest and second best. STARS
 WILBURN seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home,
 spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. DYNAMITE KITTEN vied from eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three to four
 wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway on the bend, got put to a protective hold just outside the quarter pole and was guided five wide into
 upper stretch, then got eased through to the stretch to the finish and was walked off under her own power. SHE'SAKITTYKAT hustled from the gate, led
 early on before vying from the four or five path to the inside of a pair down the backstretch, yielded the front near the nine-sixteenths, faded to the rear of the
 field briefly coaxed along before being eased through the turn, cantered four wide for home and continued under her own power to the finish while protected
 to the wire, then walked off after the finish. All riders carried an additional two pounds as mandated by a weather-related safety initiative.

 Footnotes
 WHISTLING BIRDS prompted the pace from the three path, quickened approaching the half mile pole, grabbing away the advantage as the half was being
 completed, edged away from the competition during the run around the bend, was put to a drive heading into the top of the lane, came in after a single right
 shot at the three-sixteenths marker, not bothering yet inducing the second place finisher nevertheless to alter course to the outside, dug in well enough in
 the final stages to hold sway. PIER FORTY made contact with JUDGE STANTON in the shadow of the starting gate, was put to an abbreviated ride
 afterwards to get going, took up the chase from path two, spun into the stretch under a hard drive, altered course to be outside the top one a few strides
 later, gained late, but fell well short. JUDGE STANTON gently pinched after being bumped from both sides at the break, was in path four in pursuit of the
 front runners, stepped into the stretch and proved no match. BEBE BANKER remained along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running,
 saw the pilot grab hold after things became a little tight along its route beginning from the five-sixteenths pole, got steadied just shy of the quarter pole,
 arrived into the stretch and lacked the needed response. DARING DISGUISE bobbled inward springing from the gate, resulting in some contact with its next
 door neighbor, went onward to narrowly secure the top, was at on near the two path, vying against WHISTLING BIRDS, kept at it until midpoint on the bend
 before giving way. All riders carried an additional two pounds as mandated by a weather-related safety initiative.

 CAPTAIN FROST established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the
 inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. D EMCEE three then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed
 along midway on the turn, cornered four wide into upper stretch, ran on dueling to the finish with TRANCE and just bested that rival on the wire for the place
 honors. TRANCE chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide at the quarter pole, dug in dueling with the
 aforementioned foe through to the wire but was bested at the finish for the place honors while well clear of the rest. MEND UP bumped at the start by DR.
 LLOYD, who broke inwards, chased four then five wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. DR. LLOYD
 broke in brushing the near side stall then bumped with MEND UP, chased five wide down the backstretch, backed away to last and appeared sluggish into
 the turn, was placed to a protective hold and eased up through the bend before being pulled up in upper stretch, then was subsequently vanned off. All
 riders carried an additional two pounds as mandated by a weather-related safety initiative.

 Footnotes
 CRAIGVILLE BEACH along the outside throughout, was three wide departing the backstretch, was let out a notch and asked to pick it up at the
 five-sixteentsh marker, swung into action by swinging six wide into the stretch, hooked up with WISECRACK as they rallied in tandem for the final furlong,
 struck the front end inside the sixteenth pole and edged away. WISECRACK worked up at tuck into the two path coming up the conclusion of the
 backstretch, sat within striking distance of the front runners, angled five wide into the stretch, raced towards the ones to catch teamed up with the winner, fell
 short. DOLLARSFORPENNIES away well, disputed the pace nearly from the get-go, going about the task three wide on the backstretch, and then one path
 closer to the rail but from between rivals once onto the turn, got set down in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, dueled with the MR WONDERFUL all the
 way down the stretch, got overhauled by the top twsome with under a sixteenth to go, won the fight for third. MR WONDERFUL patiently stalked the pace
 from along the outside during the initial stages, moved up to contest the pace, from path three as the widest of three after the half had been reeled off,
 inched his way to the slimmest of leads as the third fraction was being finalized, got called upon, clung to that sliver of a lead while tussling with
 DOLLARSFORPENNIES until a short distance past the sixteenth pole, went onward engaged with the aforementioned foe and lost the show. FOTIS made
 contact with COOLBOY at the start, ranged up to contend for the top with DOLLARSFORPENNIES, hand urged from path two, slid over to the inside route
 at the top of the turn, was now forced to hold off a pair of foes to the outside, did so until after more than halfway around the turn and gave way. COOLBOY
 out a bit springing from the gate, bumped with FOTIS, was then out-muscled by that opponent and forced towards the inside for a few jumps afterwards,
 saved ground for almost three-quarters, got sent five wide into the lane, had no response. All riders carried an additional two pounds as mandated by a
 weather-related safety initiative.

 OLD UPSTART jostled a bit after the start with THERE GOES JOSE, raced three to four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the
 seven-sixteenths, advanced through the latter portion of the turn circling six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over command just outside the eighth
 pole, edged away under a drive kept to task. THERE GOES JOSE jostled after the start briefly with the aforementioned foe before settling two to three wide
 at the tail of the field, came under coaxing half a mile from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to belatedly secure the place
 honors. ORPHEUS (ARG) chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, bid to the eighth pole, then
 kept on to preserve the show honors. AVAST MATEY two to three wide in aim of the front, advanced on the leader nearing the half mile pole in tandem with
 COLORADO GRANDSLAM, took over command nearing the three-eighths, shook away through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside for
 home, dug in under threat from a pair and yielded a furlong out, weakened in the late stages. THE GREAT SAMURAI off to an awkward beginning, chased
 two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, tired. FIFTY hustled from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed
 along just off the inside, came under pressure from a pair and tucked to the rail into the turn, yielded the front nearing the three-eighths, faded through the
 latter portion of the turn cornering just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. COLORADO GRANDSLAM hustled from the start, raced four then three
 wide in range of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded nearing the quarter pole and spun three wide at that station, then tired in the
 stretch. All riders carried an additional two pounds as mandated by a weather-related safety initiative.

 Footnotes
 AMERICAN POWER hustled along for the opening phases, tracked the front runners from along the inside route, came under rousing a second time leaving
 the midway point of the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, kicked into his best coming up to the sixteenth
 pole, surged by SIENA MAGIC and edged away. SIENA MAGIC moved up with willingness to the front end after losing his footing springing from the starting
 gate, got stationed at a slight distance from off the inside route, departed the backstretch forced to fend off a pair of opponents to the outside, spun into the
 lane still on top and was given his cue, displayed an inclination to come out at stages of the stretch run, pilot countering this with left side pressure,
 relinquished after finally coming out in deep stretch, easily saved second. BOOTLEGGER (FR) attained a prominent position after bobbling lightly at the
 start, was three to four wide, vying as the widest of three on the turn, was more the latter, that is four wide, after stepping into the lane, put up a fight,
 although failing to go by, before making no headway in the last stages. CREA'S BKLYN LAW three wide entering the turn, got sent five wide exiting it, made
 no impact. MAD MUNNYS pursued the pace from path two on the turn, came under a drive approaching the five-sixteenths pole, shifted a couple of paths
 farther off the rail early in the stretch, had no rally. MUCH TROUBLE disputed the pace two to three wide from between rivals to upper stretch, altered
 course over towards the inside right around the three-sixteenths pole, gave way. All riders carried an additional two pounds as mandated by a
 weather-related safety initiative.

 WHYISSHESOOLUCKY four then three wide in aim of the front, advanced to pressure the leader at the half mile pole into and through the turn, took over
 command placed to light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home set down for the drive, went clear under a drive to prevail. ABBY
 NORMAL bumped at the start by GIVE ME A HUG, then got bumped in the hindquarters by BIZNESS BEAUTY who got off in a tangle, chased four then
 three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while improving position to secure the
 place honors. BIZNESS BEAUTY off to a staggering stumbling start, lunged to keep her footing bumping the back of ABBY NORMAL forcing the rider from
 the irons for the first three to four strides and conceding six to seven lengths to the front, chased three wide from the tail of the field down the backstretch,
 tucked to be near the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes to garner
 the show honors showing good courage. GIVE ME A HUG broke out at the start bumping ABBY NORMAL, raced just off the inside in aim of the leader
 before advancing to knock heads with that rival half a mile from home tucking to the inside, got shaken off and tipped three wide at the three-eighths placed
 to coaxing, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. SHANGHAI SMILE broke in at the start brushing PLUM BAY, chased five paths off the inside down
 the backstretch, tucked two to three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. DEVIL'S
 FLAIR established the front from the start crossing to show the way in hand three wide down the backstretch, came under pressure from flanking rivals
 nearing the half mile pole, tucked to the two path into the turn shaking off the inside foe confronted to the outside by the eventual winner, yielded command
 to that rival five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. MISS ALLISON stumbled at the break and was bumped by
 PLUM BAY who recovered inwards from a bobble, chased four wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing tucked to the inside half a mile from home,
 swung three wide into upper stretch and gave way. PLUM BAY bobbled at the start recovering inwards into MISS ALLISON, chased four then three wide
 under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued three to four wide for home and made no impact. All riders carried an additional two pounds as
