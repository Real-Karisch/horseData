 MIDNIGHT RODEO quickly went to the front, edged clear on the turn then was kept to her task to prove best. SHOWREEL (GB) prompted the pace from
 the outset then was unable to go with the winner and held on for second. MAKEYOURSELFATHOME was away alertly to be forwardly placed and could
 gain little in the drive. SOUTHERN CHRISTMAS was jostled at the start then continued willingly. RAISE THE RITHM lacked a solid rally. REVOLVING
 STORM failed to menace. HOLIDAY MAGICIAN tired.

 MID OCEAN was unhurried early then rallied outside the top two entering the stretch and drove clear. ABIDE BY ME moved up menacingly into the stretch
 then lacked the needed closing kick. TO THE STARS was forwardly placed and rallied to finish best of the others. MY MAN DAN failed to menace with a
 mild bid. DREAMING OF FRANK vied for the lead racing in the two path then weakened. STRIKE 'N SPARE waited behind horses on the far turn. MR.
 BEANS prompted the early pace and tired. CREA CAN DO tired. THINK HE'S GONE saved ground disputing the pace and tired.

 DIE HARD DI dueled for the lead from the outset and turned back the challenge of SIR BRAHMS under a long drive. SIR BRAHMS, away alertly, loomed
 boldly outside the winner through the stretch but was not quite good enough in a sharp try. HOT N SPICY LOVE saved ground vying for the lead then was
 easily third. COACH ADAMS failed to menace with a mild stretch bid. DIAMOND JUNIOR lacked a rally. EXILE broke slowly then failed to be a threat.
 DEMERARA was no factor. RUMFIRE was through early.
