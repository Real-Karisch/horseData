 AUDACIOUS QUALITY , eager to run along the rail leaving the backstretch, was in hand into the turn, swung to the five path turning for home, was lightly
 bumped by CHASING THE CANDY when taking the lead near the three sixteenths pole then drew off. FIVE STAR PERFECT , two wide on the turn,
 remained in the two path in the stretch, raced on his left lead in the drive and gained the place between horses. CHASING THE CANDY , under some
 urging soon after the break, moved up two wide on the turn, gained the lead at the head of the stretch, lightly bumped the winner when drifting out and
 weakened in the drive. BOAT OVER THE HILL saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and failed to rally. GRAY GARY sprinted to the
 early lead, saved ground on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way. RIGGED ELECTION chased the pace three wide and gave way on the
 turn.

 Footnotes
 ROMANOFF pulled his way clear early on and set a comfortable pace under rating, responded when set down two wide in upper stretch, kept on under left
 handed rousing through the final furlong and held sway. THE POSER broke outward and bumped soundly with DECORATED, straightened and edged up
 along the rail to stalk the pace, came under pressure nearing the lane, finished gamely and earned the place. ON THE TURF rated three wide outside the
 winner, came under pressure past the five sixteenths and continued willingly between foes. DECORATED came in at the break and bumped with THE
 POSER, moved up three to four wide to stalk the pace, was put to urging leaving the three eighths, circled into the lane and kept trying to the line. SUDDEN
 BREEZE settled off of a sluggish pace, raced three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung out five wide for the drive but lacked a significant response.

 Footnotes
 HONEST MISCHIEF edged up inside rivals early on and stalked a contested pace, was under coaxing just off the inside while holding a forward spot mid
 turn, followed CHILLY IN CHARGE and found a seam three wide between foes leaving mid stretch, shifted out, leveled off when roused left handed and
 surged to victory in the final yards. CHILLY IN CHARGE prompted the pace three deep while under rating, moved to apply more pressure past the five
 sixteenths, was roused clear heading towards the furlong grounds, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the winner's charge. HALL PASS broke a bit
 slowly and was quickly taken off the inside, moved closer leaving the far turn and was put to pressure, swung five to six wide for the drive and closed
 steadily. HANALEI'S HOUDINI chased outside the winner, angled four wide and ranged up to loom a presence into the lane, chased past mid stretch then
 flattened out. ROHRBACHER , brushed at the break, was nudged to the front and secured the rail, handled outside pressure into the turn, was headed after
 a half mile, stayed on to contest the pace into the lane then faded. AMUNDSON came in at the break and brushed with a rival, corrected and disputed the
 pace between foes, gained a slim lead after a half mile, sparred between runners to upper stretch then gave way.

 Footnotes
 VAULT stalked the pace under confident handling outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, secured command in upper stretch
 and drew out the final furlong under brisk urging. JEHOZACAT , three wide entering the first turn, was taken to the rail after sprinting clear leaving the bend,
 saved ground around the turn, came out a bit for the drive and was no match for the winner. TROLLEY RIDE , squeezed back leaving the starting gate,
 raced two wide on the backstretch, swung to the four path turning for home and passed tired foes. LAYLA NOOR saved ground the first turn, raced in the
 two path on the far turn, swung outside horses in upper stretch and failed to menace. BEACH DIVA chased the pace two wide for the six furlongs then gave
 way. STORMOLOGIST , forward factor along the inner rail, failed to keep pace on the far turn then was steadied when lacking room entering the stretch.
 TRACE OF GRACE , three deep entering the first turn, was outrun.

 Footnotes
 SUNNY RIDGE tracked the pace while saving ground, stayed along the rail into the lane, eased out and found room nearing mid stretch, responded when
 put to hand urging, forged to command leaving the sixteenth marker and held firm under a confident ride. HAN SENSE cleared early, set a slow pace while
 saving ground, came under a ride in upper stretch, maintained the advantage past the furlong grounds, could not turn away the winner a sixteenth from
 home but kept on gamely to the line. BOBBY G , taken to rate off the rail, edged up between rivals nearing the five sixteenths, had to wait briefly entering
 the lane, shifted in and closed willingly to gain the show. GOLDEN BROWN prompted the pace outside the leader, bid to apply more pressure leaving the
 five sixteenths, was shifted out a bit leaving the three sixteenths, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. BONUS POINTS saved ground within
 range, angled three wide while under pressure into the lane and churned on between rivals. JEFAZO stalked three to four wide, was under pressure past
 the five sixteenths and came up empty. ADVENTIST , four wide into the first turn, lagged off the pace, angled six wide approaching the stretch but lacked a
 solid kick. O DIONYSUS broke a step slow, pulled his way forward and was angled out leaving the three quarter pole, moved up four wide five wide into the
 far turn, pursued to the quarter pole then gave way.

 TAPPIN CAT , bumped at the break, edged up to contention when a bit keen, steadied around the first turn then checked near the three quarter pole,
 stalked between foes, eased out around the final turn, ranged up four wide to engage the leader into the lane, moved to a short lead in upper stretch, came
 in a bit and brushed with TOUGHEST 'OMBRE while dueling inside the furlong grounds, corrected and battled in close proximity with that rival through the
 final seventy yards and prevailed. TOUGHEST 'OMBRE prompted the pace two wide outside RIVER DEEP, took over mid way on the final turn, was joined
 from his outside by TAPPIN CAT entering the stretch, dug in after being headed, was brushed while dueling past the furlong grounds then steadied when in
 some close quarters late. CHARGIN STORM settled off the rail, moved up four wide into the lane, loomed nearing mid stretch then flattened out. CANDY
 CANE LANE broke outward and bumped with TAPPIN CAT, edged up inside and stalked, angled three wide for the drive and faded. DOTHAT DANCE
 lagged off the pace, raced four wide into the lane but lacked a rally. POSTERITY , off the pace, saved ground into the lane and was not a factor. BLAME
 THE KIDS , three to four wide stalking the pace, was under pressure leaving the far turn and gave way. RIVER DEEP , wide to clear around the first turn,
 dropped in to set the pace, ceded the lead near the five sixteenths, fought on for a bit then faltered. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider
 of TOUGHEST 'OMBRE, TAPPIN CAT was disqualified and placed second.
