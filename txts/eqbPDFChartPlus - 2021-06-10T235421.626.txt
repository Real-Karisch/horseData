 LET'S MEET IN RIO tracked the early pace, went five wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole, drew off as an easy winner. FETED pressed the
 early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, was eased back off the pace, passed horses in late stretch, was no match to the winner and finished second
 best. MR JANIMAL raced in mid pack early, rushed to contend while racing between rivals and weakened. ROCK CITY ROADHOG was allowed to settle
 early, advanced six wide through the turn and offered no late rally. PASSED BY PAUL was unhurried early, went four wide into the turn and never fired.
 SUPER ACCORD chased the early pace, raced along the inside and gave way. THE LAST REP was always outrun.
