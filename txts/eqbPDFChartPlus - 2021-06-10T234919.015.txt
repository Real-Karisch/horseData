 PEPPERMINT DRIVEN hustled to the top worked a narrow lead through the turn then down the lane hanging on in determined fashion. SULLY'S FOLLY
 pressured the pace moving abreast rival throughout dueling down the lane unable to get by. ADDIE'S BEST DANCE tracked the pace shadowing dueling
 foes through the turn into upper stretch, looming outside of rivals had no final push. EL CAPA ROJO stumbled then bumped just after the break, lagging
 through the turn swung out six wide in upper stretch finding good late energy. TENDOWNINGSTREET bumped after the break lost ground to upper stretch
 finding little there at mid track. TINTERN ABBEY was always outrun. WISE EXSPENCE showed early speed then faded on the turn.

 IYWAAN went evenly through the turn surging in the three path in upper stretch wresting the lead a sixteenth out drawing clear. I'M RUNNING LATE stalked
 the pace through the turn rallying abreast the eventual winner in the four path upper stretch vying willingly to the end. HOLD MY BEER hustled out pressed
 early shaking clear on the turn, began to waver under outside pressure near the sixteenth pole fading in the two path. PIRATE EXPLOSIVE was in tight
 being bumped and jostled shortly after the break. COMANCHE CHIEF ducked in rushing from the gate, pressed along the inside weakening approaching
 the quarter pole giving way into upper stretch. MOONEY BONZ was in tight bumping shortly after the break. CALLHIMFIRST was in tight bumping shortly
 after the break.
