 Footnotes
 CALL ME COWBOY broke out and bumped Here Comes Coach at the start, then rushed up to set a clear pace inside, rounded the turn on the rail, and
 drove down the lane under steady handling, just lasting first. MR SHEEN chased the pace on the outside and took the turn in the five path, came in through
 the upper stretch, then rallied in the final sixteenth, quickly gaining on the winner, and ran out of track. RIGHT ON THE MONEY angled in and chased the
 pace from the inside, rounded the turn two wide between horses, then was herded in near the sixteenth pole and finished evenly. HERE COMES COACH
 was bumped at the start by Call Me Cowboy and into Dangerous Dan, gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn on the rail, then finished evenly.
 UPHILL CAT gave chase inside and rounded the turn on the rail, eased out mid-turn and entered the head of the lane on the outside, then finished evenly.
 PINCH THIS TOO gave chase on the outside and rounded the turn in the three path, then finished evenly. DANGEROUS DAN was bumped at the start by
 Here Comes Coach and was shuffled back leaving the chute, then gave chase well back on the outside but was eased past the five-sixteenths pole and was
 walked off. TOO MANY CORONAS hesitated at the start, broke in the air, then was slow into stride; was eased soon after the start and was walked off. The
 stewards reviewed a claim of foul lodged by the rider of Right On the Money against the rider of Mr Sheen but found no cause for change.

 Footnotes
 HYGH LIFE settled into stride early on then rallied past the seven sixteenths pole to take the lead at the three eighths, raced clear nearing the turn and held
 on while flattening stride later yards. ELUSIVE CAMILLA angled in to give chase off the rail and was gaining mildly later yards. QUEEN LUCIA chased the
 pace from the outside, rounded the turn about the five path, raced evenly down the lane and was just up for third. FLASHY BARGIRL gave chase from the
 inside, rounded the turn off the rail and finished evenly. BEAUTIFUL SUCCESS chased the early pace off the rail, eased to the four path through the turn
 and passed tiring rivals. GIANNA BELLA gave chase from the two and three paths and showed little further in the stretch. Bumped at the break, DON'T
 BELEVE WATCH picked up the chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little further. MAJESTIC LYRIC came away
 awkwardly and out to make contact with Don't Beleve Watch then saved ground to no avail.

 later yards and dug in for second. FREESTYLE FAIRY chased the pace about the three path, rounded the turn in the five path then flattened stride nearing
 the wire. FRICTION FIRE chased the pace toward the inside, steadied at the rail off the heels of rivals past the five sixteenths pole then flattened stride the
 final sixteenth. LIVE FREE chased the pace while angling to the outside, rounded the turn about the eight path and passed tired rivals in an even finish.
 CANDY BLU chased the pace, rounded the turn in the four path and showed little further down the lane. TOTO'S DARLING engaged in close early chase,
 kept aim in the three path rounding the turn then weakened. QUEENIE RULES chased the pace from the outside, rounded the turn about the seven path
 and showed little down the lane. Hustled to the lead leaving the seven sixteenths pole, CHARLIE'S LULU set a pressured pace, was headed past the five
 sixteenths pole and faded readily through the turn. DIMITRI'S IN STYLE chased the pace toward the outside, rounded the turn about the six path and
 weakened.

 the three path, then dug in under steady handling to finish well. INEXCESS AGAIN pressured the pace on the outside and dueled head to head through the

 Footnotes
 OWL RUN came away sharply to rate the pace inside, was pressured leaving the quarter pole, widened the advantage through the far turn and held on well.
 AFFIX saved ground the opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path,
 couldn't gain significantly on the winner and had to settle for second best. SILVER TAURUS stalked the pace off the rail, bid approaching the three eighths
 pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly. FIRE TIGAR raced boxed in through the opening turn and settled off the pace entering the
 backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, was boxed in again toward the quarter pole, angled out on the far turn, left the turn four wide and
 finished evenly. Shuffled back early, GREAT ROAD rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, eased out into the backstretch, bid approaching
 the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch. APPEALING GROOM raced well back toward the inside, bid
 approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn mostly in the three path, angled out in the upper stretch then lugged in down the lane.
 ROCKAROUND saved ground off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased to the three path leaving the turn and
 showed little further. ARYA PEACEFUL rounded the opening turn about the five path and stalked the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three
 eighths pole then weakened approaching the top of the lane. CROSS ME AGAIN showed little response after saving ground the opening turn.
 LEESGONETOHEAVEN rated close in the five path the first turn then showed little response through the backstretch.

 OPERA NITE stumbled badly at the start then pressured the pace on the outside, took over near the half pole and raced in contention through the
 backstretch, was caught near the three-eighths pole and continued to duel from there through the turn in the three path, took over again mid-turn and drew
 clear approaching the head of the lane, then drove down the lane and held on. THE NAMES BILLY settled off the pace on the outside, bid at the
 five-sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the five path, then dug in under steady handling and was slowly closing on the winner. SIENTE EL VIENTO settled
 well back on the inside, bid approaching the five-sixteenths pole, started the turn on the rail but eased out to the four path through the turn, then gained
 down the lane on the outside and finished evenly. IFURNOTFIRSTURLAST broke out sharply and corrected course, then rushed up and angled in to rate a
 pressured pace inside, was caught near the half pole and raced in contention through the backstretch, took over near the three-eighths pole and continued
 to duel from that point through the turn on the rail, but was caught mid-turn and weakened. LITE THE STORM settled off the pace on the outside, made a
 mild bid past the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the five path, but flattened out in the stretch. TRUFFLES AND GOLD pressured the pace two
 wide between horses but was through early. CREATIVE MIST broke awkwardly and was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 MISS FRANLUDA stalked the pace inside through the front stretch and raced hemmed in the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the
 three eighths pole, took the lead at the five sixteenths, drew clear nearing the far turn and held on well. GRACEFUL GODDESS settled off the pace and off
 the rail the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then couldn't gain significantly on the winner.
 CHARITABLE LASS came away a bit awkwardly and was shuffled back shortly afterward, rounded the first turn in the three path, moved out into the
 backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, progressed in the four path of the far turn and showed little further. BELLA FOX saved ground off the pace,
 bid toward the three eighths pole, improved her position in the four path of the far turn and finished evenly. SOMETHING SWEET stalked the pace about the
 three path the first turn and took the lead into the backstretch, moved to the inside at the three eighths pole, was pressured leaving the pole, headed at the
 five sixteenths, dropped back at the quarter and weakened rounding the far turn. HAY KAREN came out at the break and rounded the opening turn about
 the five path, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of the far turn and finished evenly. SOARING ELLA raced well off the pace while saving
 ground and showed only mild response past the three eighths pole. After steadying at the start, HURRICANE MISS took the lead at the three quarter pole
 while angling in and rated the pace through the front stretch, was headed at the five eighths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths then weakened rounding
 the far turn. MARIAH'S CALM rated close inside and took a brief slim lead past the five eighths pole, was caught leaving the half mile pole and faded from
 the three eighths. WIND AND STORM steadied at the start, raced six wide the opening turn, rated close into the backstretch then faded after a half mile.
