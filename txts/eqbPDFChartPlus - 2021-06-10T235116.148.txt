 Footnotes
 NICE ICE stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, took the lead outside a foe in midstretch, drifted out some past midstretch and proved
 best under urging. COPPER FEVER angled in after the right hand curve and chased inside, came out leaving the hill and three deep into the stretch, angled
 inward past midstretch and edged a rival for the place. TOKEN VOW chased outside a rival, came out leaving the hill and four wide into the stretch and
 finished with interest to be edged for second. JACCAT broke in and slowly, saved ground off the pace and finished with some interest inside. SHE'S LEGIT
 chased a bit off the rail, was in tight off heels nearing the dirt crossing, came out in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. NO WINE UNTASTED had
 speed three deep then angled in and stalked the pace, came out into the stretch and could not offer the necessary late kick. TRUE TESTAMENT went up
 inside to duel for the lead, fought back a bit off the rail in midstretch and weakened in the final furlong. DUTTON'S LEGEND had speed between foes then
 dueled outside a rival, drifted out some into the stretch and had little left for the drive. Rail on hill at zero.

 LIFE OF ILLUSION dueled between horses then outside a rival on the turn, took the advantage leaving the turn, kicked clear under urging in the stretch and
 proved best. WHAT'S BRUIN prompted the pace three deep then stalked off the rail into and on the turn and into the stretch and was clearly second best.
 ETCHING hopped in a slow start, saved ground off the pace, came out past midstretch and split rivals late for the show. CYRIELLE had good early speed
 and dueled inside, fought back leaving the turn, had the rider lose the whip into the stretch and was edged late for third. SHE'S FUNNY close up stalking the
 pace off the rail then four wide into the turn, continued off the inside and three deep into the stretch and was outfinished for a minor award. AUNT LUBIE
 broke slowly, was between horses early then chased a bit off the rail to the stretch and did not rally. WISH YOU WERE MINE three deep early, settled
 outside a rival then off the rail and gave way in the stretch.

 second turn and four wide into the stretch and also finished well. KONA DREAMS pulled his way along inside to duel for the lead, inched away in
 midstretch, held well to deep stretch and was overtaken. POPULAR KID four wide early, stalked three deep, continued four wide on the second turn and into

 Footnotes
 SPOKANE EAGLE stalked between horses then chased off the rail, came out in the stretch and rallied late under left handed urging to get up in the final
 stride. TREASURE HUNTER sped to the early lead, set the pace off the rail then a bit off the fence, angled to the inside on the turn and held on well but was
 caught on the line. GLORIOUS CROWN saved ground stalking the pace, came out leaving the turn and into the stretch and bested the others. CARAY
 moved up between horses to stalk the pace on the backstretch then a bit off the rail, continued inside on the turn and weakened in the drive. ON THE
 ROCKS close up five wide then four wide on the backstretch, went three deep into and out of the turn and weakened. SHARON'S FURY stalked between
 horses then three deep on the turn and into the stretch and also weakened. RHETTBUTLER pulled between horses stalking the pace and steadied in tight a
 half mile out to drop back, continued off the rail on the turn and into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

 Footnotes
 NESSY saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch, rallied under urging to gain the lead three deep in late stretch and proved best. A RED
 TIE DAY took the early lead and went the opening quarter mile in :24.30 seconds, set a pressured pace inside, inched away in the stretch the first time,
 edged away again when a rival challenged on the backstretch, came a bit off the rail in the stretch, was between horses in deep stretch, could not quite
 match the winner late but gamely held second. RYE chased outside a rival early then angled in leaving the hill, saved ground, came out a bit into the stretch
 then angled back to the inside in upper stretch, bid along the rail in deep stretch and was edged for the place. EVO CAMPO (IRE) pressed the pace outside
 the runner-up then stalked off the rail, bid again outside that one early on the backstretch, tracked outside a rival into the final turn then off the inside leaving
 that turn, was between horses past midstretch and was outfinished. LAZZAM (GB) angled in on the hill and chased inside then a bit off the rail leaving the
 backstretch, went outside a rival on the final turn, came out leaving that turn and four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. PRINCIPAL BOB
 chased outside a rival then three deep, continued outside a foe on the final turn and three wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the drive and weakened.
 MOONMAN stalked off the rail then between horses, continued outside leaving the last turn, came out into the stretch and also weakened. Rail on hill at
 zero. HAND TIMED.

 Footnotes
 RED SHELBY sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inside, kicked away in the stretch and held under urging. BEAUTY DIVINE stalked the pace off
 the rail to the stretch, continued off the inside and finished willingly to be second best. WARM IT UP angled in and saved ground stalking the winner
 throughout and bested the others. ON A TOOT chased just off the rail, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. FLUORESCENT broke a bit
 slowly, settled off the rail, angled in on the hill, came out into the stretch and could not summon the necessary response. SHEZA FACTOR chased outside
 then alongside a rival down the hill and into the stretch and also lacked a rally. DESERT APPEAL broke inward and slowly, saved ground chasing the pace,
 cut the corner into the stretch and did not rally. MY ALCHEMIST stalked outside then alongside a rival, came out into the stretch, was between foes in
 midstretch, drifted in late and weakened. SHANGHAI TOOTSIE unhurried off the rail early, angled in outside a rival leaving the hill and failed to menace.
 LUCY BUCKNER broke slowly, dropped back off the rail, was pulled up midway on the hill and walked off. Rail on hill at zero.
