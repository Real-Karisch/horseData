 IGNOTUS was prominent three wide between horses around the first turn, fell back on the backstretch, rallied the rail around the final turn and quickly ran
 clear through late stretch. NAVASODA moved four wide to command midway on the first turn, drew out on the final turn, remained clear into the final
 sixteenth and tired. RITEAMONTOFMSCHIEF was unhurried inside, came out between horses early in the stretch while outside the winner then couldn't
 keep up with that one. I GOT CLASS lagged early, swung wide into the stretch and improved position. HASHTAG WINNING raced two wide and lacked the
 needed closing respsonse. MISTER HUMOR moved outside the early leader after a quarter and was finished after five furlongs.
