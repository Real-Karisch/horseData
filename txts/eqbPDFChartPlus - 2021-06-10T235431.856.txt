 Footnotes
 MR. LUV MAKER stalked from between horses, was roused on the bend, rallied from outside and caught ROYAL'S POSITION seventy yards out. PRINCE
 ABUBU gradually progressed from inside and was forced to weave around the tiring HALO HUNTER as he fought for second inside the final furlong.
 UNCLE PADDY angled out on the turn, came widest into the lane, battled for second but did not have enough late. ROYAL'S POSITION shared the early
 lead outside HALO HUNTER, moved clear in the lane, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but was easily best of the rest. QUEEN'S LITTLE RED
 prominent early, gave way between foes through the lane. STRATUS STORM was away slowly and passed inside tired ones the final furlong. HALO
 HUNTER was hustled to contest the pace from inside but tired for the drive. BOUND TO RULE chased in midpack and began to fade from path three on the
 bend. HELIOS hesitated then broke awkwardly and was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 MIAS MOONBEAM hesitated slightly and bumped with WILLIES WAR WAGON, was then steadied behind traffic, hustled up from outside, moved clear
 without urging three wide on the turn and continued widen command while under a drive the last furlong. R HIDDEN TREASURE showed first, moved
 toward the inside midway on the backstretch, had the rail on the bend, was no match for MISS MOONBEAM but proved easily second best.
 SCHWARZKOPF prominent between rivals, altered in trying to keep a clear path midway on the backstretch, did not keep up along the rail on the turn,
 gained third upper stretch but could only just hold his position late. WILLIES WAR WAGON bumped from the rear at the break, angled off the rail midway on
 the backstretch, drifted out into the lane, was angled in some and lodged a mild bid. ROBBIE JONES forwardly placed inside, was checked solidly when his
 path was compromised midway on the backstretch, soon trailed and lacked a stretch bid. CRAWFORD AVE displayed early speed between rivals but gave
 way leaving the quarter pole.

 BIG MAN HUNGATE forwardly placed outside, progressed under urging from outside on the bend, came into the lane four wide, took the lead seventy yards
 out and just lasted. SLICK MICK well back early, lost ground widest through the turn, made a strong move in the stretch but came up short. JAZZY SUN
 was sent to contest the pace between horses, gained the rail on the turn, moved clear into the stretch but began to wear down in the late going.
 WILDWOOD RANGER turned her head at the start, progressed between rivals on the turn, closed through the lane and altered outside JAZZY SUN in the
 waning yards. LITTLE KICK disputed the pace from inside but began to slowly wear down before finishing a half mile. KID PARADISE vied for the lead
 outside JAZZY SUN but gradually weakened for the drive. W W SPRING STORM in contention early, angled in nearing the bend, did not keep up along the
 rail on the turn, showed a willingness to run in the lane and was steadied as he squeezed through inside LITTLE KICK deep stretch. HAYDAY'S PAYDAY
 was sent to duel for the early lead between rivals, faltered into the turn, distanced himself from the rest as he coasted in the stretch and was walked off.

 THISDUCKCANFLY bore in at the break, bumping LEGENDARY VISION, was quickly clear, showed the way staying off the inside, was under a drive
 through the stretch, all out in the late going and held on. SIRCORRI without early speed, advanced along the rail on the turn, gradually angled out five wide
 upper stretch, made a strong move in the late going but was too late. BENNY COLORS raced closest to THISDUCKCANFLY from just outside, commenced
 his bid on the bend, was closing in on the leader deep stretch but also came up short. SEEYALATERBYE hesitated at the start, saved ground and also
 made a strong bid the final eighth. BUMPTYBUMPBUMP in contention early, did not keep up just off the inside through the turn, his rider lost his whip upper
 stretch and could only make up minor ground late. MATTHEW'S THUNDER was bumped, forced inward and steadied at the start, was an early factor from
 inside but began to tire as he moved to the outside through the turn. LEGENDARY VISION was bumped solidly and forced into MATTHEW'S THUNDER at
 the break, also steadied, altered out for a clear path on the backstretch and faded on the bend.

 Footnotes
 THE PEGASUS BOOK well placed early, waited for room along the rail on the turn, got through leaving the bend, took the lead inside the final furlong and
 held sway. GARLAND'S SPIRIT vied for the early lead inside AT THE GRANDE, gained the rail and moved clear on the turn, floated out some leaving the
 bend, was challenged from inside after entering the last furlong and lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. LAZYLOVIN came into contention three
 wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, threatened with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. BEAUZIPPITY forwardly placed between
 rivals, took the rail into the turn, fanned out leaving the turn, bumped with AT THE GRANDE at the top of the lane, altered in some for a clear path, also had
 an easy striking position midstretch but could not sustain his bid. HIGHWAY FIFTYFOUR gradually progressed from inside to have a striking position at the
 eighth pole but also leveled off in the late going. DONTCHANGETRAINERS chased from between rivals and began to tire three wide on the turn. AT THE
 GRANDE displayed early speed from outside, began to tire from between horses leaving the turn, was bumped at the top of the stretch while in tight
 quarters and continued to fade. RED REDEMPTION failed to menace in a wide trip. DENOUN THE ROAD was a step slow at the break, rushed up from
 inside, began to yield after the first quarter mile, was checked when his path was taken into the turn and steadily gave way.

 Footnotes
 ELIZABETH'S FEVER was quickly clear, under a drive through the stretch and proved much the best. FIGHTING MARKET chased from paths two or three
 and caught the weakening SO OBVIOUS for second late. SO OBVIOUS forwardly placed outside ELIZABETH'S FEVER, was no match for that one in the
 stretch and weakened late. SHARPSBURG was a step slow at the start, advanced from inside on the turn, drifted out entering the lane but was closing the
 gap on the second flight late. KISS'N ROSIE chased from outside, lost considerable ground staying outside SHARPSBURG entering the stretch but showed
 a willingness to run inside the last furlong. GOTTA GO BACK was never a factor in a ground-saving trip.

 ROYAL'S RETURN soon drew away from the rest under urging, was put to a drive again in the lane, began to tire the last furlong but managed to hold on.
 MORE THAN KRAZY crowded briefly leaving the chute, was well back early, lost ground, fanning widest for the stretch run, surged under mostly hand
 urging the last furlo0ng but was too late. JUST SKY chased from outside, improved position four wide on the turn, rallied from between horses in the lane
 and was also too late. CAROL'S A CASE came into contention along the rail on the turn, battled for second in the stretch and lacked the extra needed in the
 waning yards. HOLD ME SUE raced closest to ROYAL'S RETURN from just off the inside but weakened deep stretch. SING KITTY SING unruly in the gate,
 was being held by the assistant starter when the gate opened and lost all chance. SHAKER MAKER chased from between horses and began to tire three
 wide on the turn. There was a stewards' inquiry into SING KITTY SING'S start. After their review, it was determined SING KITTY SING was not prepared for
 the start when and was declared a non-starter for pari-mutuel purposes only.

 RUN AWAY MARKET without early speed, picked up his pace just off the inside on the bend, fanned four wide for the stretch run, dueled for the lead
 outside JOCHERO inside the last furlong the drew off the final sixteenth. ARK FLASH well back early, commenced his bid from outside on the turn, lost
 further ground fanning widest for the stretch run, closed well and caught JOCHERO for second late. JOCHERO chased from outside, began to make his bid
 into the turn, was checked solidly when OUTSIDE RUN crossed his path after three furlongs, came again from between rivals in the stretch, dueled for the
 lead inside the final eighth but did not have enough left. RUMBLER chased in close quarters between horses on the backstretch, took over second two wide
 leaving the bend but tired for the drive. PIRATE'S ON LINE showed no speed, had the rail through the turn, angled out for a clear path midstretch and
 passed between some tired ones. MIGHTY GENE was hustled to a clear lead early but tired from inside through the lane. DORIE'S LAST chased from
 inside, began to tire after a half mile, floated out into the stretch and quickly gave way. OUTSIDE RUN prominent just outside MIGHTY GENE in the early
 going but ducked out after three furlongs and lost his rider.
