 Footnotes
 DANCE EVEN tracked four wide, launched a bold bid leaving the turn, came in a bit and tightened up REAGANIZE leaving the turn, opened clear, drifted
 out through the drive and held sway. REAGANIZE prompted the pace three deep, was put in tight between horses leaving the turn, altered course to the
 outside, took a run at the winner, was floated out through the drive and settled for the place. CASH TICKET set pressured pace along the inside, weakened
 entering the stretch but safely held the show. JOE FRANK was slow into stride, came three wide, waited to avoid the riderless horse entering the stretch,
 shifted out and finished with a mild rally. STARCATTER contended toward the inside, faltered leaving the turn, drifted out and faded. OHMYMIC failed to
 respond. SCHMOODS was through early. DR SPAULDING stumbled at the start and unseated his jockey. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start,
 and the jockey of REAGANIZE lodged an objection against the winner for alleged interference entering the stretch, but following the review the Stewards
 made no change to the order of finish.

 BRACKEN BELLE set the pressured pace three wide, edged clear a furlong out and dug in gamely to hold sway. PERSONAL CAT bumped with
 SIMMARDS HEART at the start and was away slow, advanced between horses, angled out entering the stretch, kicked on well but settled for the place.
 SIMMARDS HEART bumped at the start to get away slow, moved up five wide, loomed large entering the stretch, but flattened during the drive.
 MINESHAFT DIVA stalked the pace four wide, came to level terms leaving the turn, but weakened between horses. NORWEGIAN LADY broke slow, closed
 the gap along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, but faltered between horses. FLATTER'S SONG prompted the pace along the inside, contested the
 issue to the final furlong and gave way. SCATTER POINT was never a factor. STORMFIELD was through early.

 toward the inside, split horses and was along for the show. MOVE THE CHAINS settled saving ground, got through but went evenly. SAINT'S BRO
 contended four wide, angled out entering the stretch but lacked a response when called upon. STORMY GOING set the pressured pace three wide, but

 BOLD COLORS tracked four wide, drew even with three furlongs to run, battled on through a long drive and wore down GALLANT CAUSE in the final yards.
 GALLANT CAUSE contested the pace three wide, fought gamely through a long drive, had the rider lose the whip inside the sixteenth pole and was unable
 to resist. SKYDERE settled in hand, ranged up five wide, loomed large but flattened and settled for the minor award. CANNONSHOT brushed the gate and
 was away slow, shifted out and made a middle move five wide, but faltered entering the stretch and faded. DECISION TIME set the pressured pace along
 the inside, but tired before going six furlongs and faded. ART'S DESIRE went wide and was never a factor. CONVINCING showed little.
