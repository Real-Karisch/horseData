 Footnotes
 HOPEWICK trailed early, went to pursuit of the lead at the quarter pole, shifted out through traffic into the final turn and kicked away to score easily. PICK A
 PRIZE unhurried away, was reserved off the pacesetters, moved up closer into the final turn, swung three-wide into the stretch and lacked the kick needed.
 ISABIRD settled in range, chased the leaders leaving the backstretch, was brushed racing four to five-wide into the drive and flattened. IMPULSIVE BUY
 vied inside for the early lead, contested the pace from a rail position and had nothing left in reserved for the drive. SASSY MISS broke alertly, contended the
 pace and came up empty for the drive. DUMONT settled mid pack racing in the three path and failed to produce a bid.

 Footnotes
 BEAR FABULOUS SON controlled the pace early, drew away when unchallenged then opened up into the stretch. LONG TIME DON stalked the pace from
 between foes, chased into the stretch but was no match for the winner. UP JUMPS A MONSTER settled in range racing three-wide, launched a three-wide
 bid leaving the backstretch but failed to threaten in the drive. VALID POSITION shifted out into the five path carrying DER HE WAS GONE wide leaving the
 first turn, moved up into contention, chased four to five-wide in the far turn and evened out. DER HE WAS GONE carried six-wide in the first turn and
 showed some interest late. CALL IT EVEN prompted the pace and was done early. WILD ROMEO tracked inside, bumped the rail racing into the
 backstretch and stopped.

 gate leaving, raced in closest pursuit, hung early stretch and was out finished. MADAM BULLET tracked inside, chased in the far turn, swung three-wide into
 the drive and failed to threaten. GAYSHAN saved to no avail. FUTURE STATE lacked running room leaving the chute and failed to produce a bid.

 TEGAN'SBESTWILKO pressed the pace, drew away at the quarter pole and opened up under steady encouragement. RACING THE WIND was brushed
 leaving the gate, raced four-wide in the first turn, moved up menacingly in the far turn and finished gamely in vain but was no match for the winner. STELLA
 ELLA OLA trailed early and launched an all out bid belatedly. BIG RIVER hit side of gate breaking outside brushing RACING THE WIND and rallied mildly
 late. CANDY RED set the early pace, was overtaken easily leaving the backstretch and faded steadily. MOVE WITH JOY stalked the pacesetters and
 stopped. SACRED MISSION settled in range from the three path and was done early.

 Footnotes
 WILKO'S AGREEMENT saved ground early, lodged a three-wide bid in the far turn, circled the field into the stretch and ran down the leader. RUN AWAY
 LANE lost ground leaving the first turn, chased three-wide then was wide racing into the stretch run, gained a narrow lead mid stretch and was caught late.
 MYTHICAL WARRIOR lacked early seed, saved ground and closed late to earn show. JAX ON broke alertly, chased the pace along rail and gave way late.
 CLEVER BOOTS emerged the leader leaving the first turn, responded to looming threat from NAVAJO DAN and wilted abruptly mid stretch. FLYING WINE
 passed tiring rivals. SILENT TRUTH vied between foes for the lead, was unable to keep pace with the field and stopped. NAVAJO DAN broke inward, vied
 three-wide, moved up closer leaving the backstretch, yielded at the top of the stretch and was eased.

 early speed, raced four-wide in the first turn and tired. ANNIE'SLITTLEANGEL showed little. EMMA DAHLING flashed early speed and retreated.
