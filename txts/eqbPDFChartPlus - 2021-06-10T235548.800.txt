 Footnotes
 SPECIAL JO forwardly placed early inside, moved into the two path into the turn, advanced to challenge midway on the turn, vied past the furlong marker
 between rivals, edging away late. MONTEZUMA EXPRESS prompted the pace in the three path, set down for the drive, bid past the furlong marker, could
 not match the winner late. CITY SAGE broke alertly, set the pace while racing toward the inside, briefly raced on equal terms with the top two past the
 furlong marker then weakened. SHORE TO SHORE back early, began a useful advance in the two path through the turn, lacked clear room in traffic into the
 stretch while remaining off the inside, dropped to the rail upper stretch, flattened out. MAGNUM FORCE lacked speed, raced four wide into the turn, three
 wide into the stretch, went evenly through the lane. BRUVVER MAX void of speed, saved ground through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while
 not a threat. UNION LABEL tired while racing toward the inside. GRAVITY FORCE in tight just after the start, moved up race in mid pack, tired while racing
 three wide.

 Footnotes
 SHOE MONEY never far back in the three path, moved closer in the turn, roused, took over into the stretch, lugged in nearing the furlong marker, drove
 clear. JOAN'S DELIGHT settled off the pace and the inside, three out to four wide in the turn, finished willingly to annex the place. DELTA CHANCE
 bumped then steadied at the start, raced far back, began to advance midway on the turn, came four wide into the lane, finished well to be closing the gap
 late. QUIETLY CUBA broke alertly, soon got well clear, continued to show the way through the turn, faltered when headed by the winner into the lane. HOT
 BLOODED SONG chased the winner off the inside, set down for the drive, was beginning to weaken when bothered by the lugging winner in upper stretch,
 continued give way late. CAVA HOYOS lacked speed, saved ground turn, asked along late in the bend, improved slightly while not a serious threat. BIG
 STATEMENT off a step slow, raced well back, improved position while also not a serious factor. KIOWA CAN in mid pack off the inside, came three wide
 into the lane, came up empty. WILBUR in the second flight while racing off the inside, tired in the drive. SURPRISE SUSPECT bumped then steadied at the
 start, raced four wide into the turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. JONESBORO BOY tired while racing four wide. EUROWAY bore out badly in the run
 up the backstretch, again midway on the turn, trailed home.

 Footnotes
 LAMU moved inside, narrowly set the pace set down entering the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker, was fully extended to prove best while drifting out
 slightly. RIBBON BOX pressed the issue off the inside, moved up to duel, raced on equal terms with the winner into and through upper stretch, was
 outfinished while being floated out by the winner late. GO GOLD back off the pace and the inside, continued in pursuit while three wide out of the final turn,
 proved no match for the top two, well clear of the others. ALSHUJAA one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. RAGE RIOT four wide through
 the first turn, continued on the outside through the second bend, made little impact. SYLVAN HILLS BOY forwardly placed for six furlongs just off the inside,
 weakened through the stretch. SHEMP settled well off the pace while between foes for much of the way, lacked a response. PAPA BROSE saved ground to
 no avail. HUNTER HENRY broke awkwardly, trailed far back in failing to threaten.

 Footnotes
 AREED with the pace outside, cleared to the inside, showed the way through the turn, responded when the runner up came alongside into the stretch, dug
 in late to prevail in determined fashion. QUICK SAND forwardly placed early between rivals, chased the winner through the turn, engaged that one from the
 outside for the drive, slight drift, extended drive, outfinished. WILDCAT FRIENDSHIP with the first flight early, fell back a bit in the turn, could not get back to
 the top two through the stretch, well clear of the others. SIDEARM in tight at the start, came three wide out of the final turn, went evenly to the wire.
 WICKED RASCAL brushed at the start, flashed brief speed inside, began to retreat before a half. HEMMINGER was not involved while four wide. HOW
 ABOUT HIM steadily faded four wide.

 Footnotes
 DOUBLE A forwardly placed inside, fell back in some traffic second turn, steered out three wide for room turning for home, angled back, gained command
 and held late in a game effort. ZIMMERMAN settled off the pace and the inside, four wide advance to challenge in the second turn, showed the way past the
 furlong marker, between foes late, outkicked. NAN'S PIERCE ARROW raced in mid pack off the rail, closer four wide turning for home, lost some ground to
 the top two into the lane, got back to the top two late, hung in the final strides. ALPHA BRAVO void of speed, five down to four wide first turn, continued
 outside, four wide as well through the second turn, improved slightly without posing a serious threat to the top three. CITY ALL STAR narrowly showed the
 way into the first turn two path, continued to show the way up the backstretch, weakened when confronted for the drive. HOTTERTHANAPISTOL prompted
 the pace in the three path, lacked a closing punch. INVICTOR lacked speed, failed to muster a rally. DART TOSS saved ground to no avail. DANCING CAT
 TRICK was outrun while racing three wide. REMEMBER THE IRISH restless in the gate, off slowly, finished far back.

 DOUBLE OURS pressured the pace from the outside, took over turning for home, got clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late under
 steady handling. MESOMA pinched back at the start, steadily advanced through and around traffic turn, swung five wide into the stretch, finished willingly to
 be clear for the place. STORMY PACIFIC void of speed, three wide out of the turn, shifted out a bit and closed well while too late. PURELY GIVEN in mid
 pack for a half off the inside, three wide into the lane, went evenly then final furlong in lacking a closing kick. WELL MANNERED set or forced the pace for
 five furlongs closest to the inside, faltered late. MR. Z mid pack early inside, shuffled back along the inside late backstretch, asked along turn, checked up
 on a tiring rivals heels with a furlong remaining then displayed a modest amount of late interest. GO VO broke out, raced off the pace, four out to five wide
 through the turn, tired in the drive. MISTER POLLARD off a bit slow, failed to menace with a four wide trip. ABBAA broke sharp, set the pace off the inside,
 stopped back through the stretch.

 clear late. RIPPIN RANGER never far back while racing outside, raced four wide through the turn, set down when straightened for home, along for the place
 midtrack, no threat to the winner. PATRIOTIC AMERICAN forwardly placed inside, slipped through along the inside turning for home, lodged a brief, mild bid
 along the rail midstretch, caught late for the place. ASLEEPINCHURCH in the second group three path, angled in to be two wide in some traffic exiting the
 turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a late response. HEARTLAND HIT broke very sharp, quickly established the pace from the two path, continued to
 show the way into the stretch then faltered when headed by the winner upper stretch. SMART QUESTION was never dangerous while racing three wide.
 BEST TRICK YET in some early traffic just off the inside, dropped to the rail for the turn, failed to muster a rally. WILDCARD void of speed, not a factor.
 RIVER PLACE off slowly, four wide trip. POPCORN in some traffic the opening furlong, steadied, fell back, never a threat. BROTHER LOVE finished early,
 far back.

 ON THE LAM well back in the two path, rallied after moving inside, split foes past the furlong marker, finished full of run to win going away. CONQUEST
 WILDCAT tracked the first flight in the three path, dove to the inside when advancing into the stretch, roused, took over, proved no match for the winner the
 final sixteenth. RECKLING off a step slow, far back, saved ground into and through the early part of the turn, two path into the lane, finished up willingly to
 earn the show. SMOKIN NOW vied up front while just off the inside, got out late in the turn, offered little resistance to the top two just inside the furlong
 marker, continued to weaken to the wire. COLONEL SLEWIE made little impact while racing three wide. D R C MAJESTIC MAN vied up front on the
 outside, floated out to be five wide turning for home, gave way in the drive. R FAST LIFE vied up front while between rivals, also was floated out by SMOKIN
 NOW turning for home, backed up.

 Footnotes
 EASTER INDY in mid pack early, continued in traffic turn, split foes to move closer with a quarter to run, split another pair of foes to take control nearing the
 furlong grounds, got clear, enough left to hold off the runner up. DUTCH PARROT unhurried early off the inside, swung out five wide turning for home,
 brushed, finished fast to be rapidly getting to the winner late. LADY LAKE forwardly placed in the three path, continued prominently into the lane, had little
 left for the top two the final furlong, saved the show. AVISIONOFCHOCOLATE off the pace and the inside, three wide and in traffic turning for home, lacked
 a closing response. BLUSHING BELLA in the second group along the inside, continued to save ground turn, came up empty for the drive. CHILEAN
 QUEEN wide trip, failed to menace. SOPHIAS BIG GIRL with the pace in the three path, showed the way into the stretch, gave way. PINK FLASH raced
 back, came six wide out of the turn when beginning to tire, brushed with the runner up, continued to back up. LITTLE SHOES off a step slow, never a threat.
 SADIE BE MINE vied up front two path, stopped. AUNT GAYLE forwardly placed in the early going, steadily faded. ROXY ROCKET raced very wide, far
 back.
