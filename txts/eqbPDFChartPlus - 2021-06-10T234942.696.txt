 GRAMS FUTURE settled in nicely early, rallied through the turn three wide, roused to clear off in the final furlong. CAROL'S ROYALTY good speed to duel
 to the stretch, clear late lead but could not last. TOPO CHICA off slowly, rallied widest out of turn for the show spot. CAT'S POPSTAR rushed to duel from
 two path but gave way in the stretch run. STAY IN THE BUGGY never a real factor from off rail into the stretch run. TOO SHORT speed three wide to turn
 and gave way readily thereafter. EASTER WEEKEND was through early and dropped back.

 Footnotes
 MAMMA LOVES YOU perfect position to turn, rallied in the lane to win the head bob. UNCATCHABLE off a beat slow, rushed between horses, inside the
 furlong marker but nailed on the wire in a good effort. QUEST APPROVAL speed to the front, led to the half hooked in stretch, weakened. REAGANIZE
 inside trip, pressed leader to turn, shuffled back, no bid. RIGHT ON MUNICH raced evenly with no late gain in the stretch run. LOOKINFORFUN chased
 pace to turn, gave way readily while attempting to bear out badly through the turn. ASTRO MINISTER never a factor, far back. DUNNY BUG unruly loading,
 pulled up backstretch and reluctantly vanned off.
