 Footnotes
 SHACKLE ME GOOD vied outside HASHTAG SELFIE while in hand, moved clear under a light hold leaving the three eighths pole, turned away an inside
 challenge in upper stretch and steadily pulled away under a strong drive. CHEF KAREN , three wide to the far turn, angled in and advanced leaving the five
 sixteenths, had aim on the winner in upper stretch, failed to go on but was well clear of the rest. SPICY GIRL RED chased outside a rival, dropped back
 some after six furlongs, shifted out to be four to five wide in upper stretch and churned on willingly to come back and edge AFRICAN WILDCAT for the
 show. AFRICAN WILDCAT settled four wide, edged up leaving the far turn, angled six wide under a drive nearing the lane then flattened out in the final
 furlong. FED UP FIRED UP was outrun. HASHTAG SELFIE rushed up to the inside of the winner and gained a short early lead, was hounded by that one to
 the far turn, angled out leaving the three eighths pole, wandered outward approaching the stretch and tired. LA LA BAMBA chased in the two path, moved
 out some while under a ride past the three eighths, failed to go on and tired through the lane.

 WHIRLIN CURLIN moved up and bid four wide between rivals nearing the five eighths marker, dueled around the turn, was under strong encouragement
 outside foes into the lane, dogged STILL HAVING FUN from the head of the lane, got the best of that one inside the sixteenth marker and held firm. STILL
 HAVING FUN broke a step slow, fought some restraint and pulled his rider forward to engage runners after a quarter mile, vied inside a trio leaving the three
 eighths while holding a slim lead in the two path, kept the winner at bay from the quarter pole to about the sixteenth marker, failed to switch to his correct
 lead but kept on valiantly to the finish. CLEVER MIND settled off of a four-way pace scramble, moved up three wide after a half mile and appeared poised to
 threaten, failed to seriously respond as he lugged in towards the rail in upper stretch, came back out, kept attempting to get in near the sixteenth marker and
 closed some late. JAMAICAN DON broke on top, got out early and set the pace in about the five path, vied four deep leaving the far turn, failed to quicken
 with the leaders past the five sixteenths and faded. CORDMAKER bid three wide between runners nearing the five furlong pole, stayed on between foes to
 the quarter pole then gave way. RITEAMONTOFMSCHIEF saved ground and weakened.

 Footnotes
 VUA SAIGON disputed the pace inside horses around the turn, drifted out turning for home and narrowly prevailed in an extended drive. THE GREAT
 RONALDO , two wide leaving the turn, angled to the five path near the eighth pole, advanced outside horses and hung. LIL LOVE MACHINE , three wide
 around the turn, floated to the four path entering the stretch, gained the lead in upper stretch and weakened. BIG SLICK lacked speed, worked between
 horses in upper stretch, raced in the five path in upper stretch and flattened out outside horses. MR. OCTOBER hugged the rail on the turn, remained inside
 horses in the stretch and gave way. MOONSPELL , outrun, angled to the seven path in mid stretch. FAR FROM AWESOME prompted the pace outside the
 winner, failed to keep pace turning for home and steadied behind THE GREAT RONALDO near the eighth pole. CRIMSON SECRET , four deep on the turn,
 chased the pace, was fanned to the six path in upper stretch and gave way. WORLD VIEW raced well off the rail and was no factor. MONEY MARKET was
 outrun.

 Footnotes
 MS LOCUST POINT, a bit reluctant to load, broke sharply and was keen to go while four wide outside rivals, asserted herself and took command after a
 quarter mile, moved clear while under rating mid turn, opened up after being set down in upper stretch, was kept alert with a couple of left handed cracks in
 mid stretch then held firm under steady hand encouragement. IVY BELL hesitated when the gates sprung then broke in the air, spotting the field several
 lengths, settled off the pace while four wide, angled outside runners leaving the three eighths pole, circled five wide into the stretch and finished well to
 bridge the gap. LINE OF BEST FIT vied between runners early on, could not quicken with the winner leaving the far turn, stalked to the quarter pole, lacked
 a response in mid stretch and faded. MY MAGICIAN saved ground while gaining quickly past the three eighths, chased the winner into the stretch but came
 up empty in the final furlong. LAKE PONCHATRAIN , off the early pace, saved ground mid turn and failed to rally. FEAR NO EVIL gave four wide pursuit to
 the head of the lane and faded. SHE'S HOT WIRED vied early inside a pair of rivals, failed to keep pace past the three furlong marker and gradually gave
 way.

 the three path turning for home and passed tired rivals. STEAMY HOT , four wide on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. NUMBER THE STARS ,
 rated behind horses down the backstretch, worked between horses in the stretch and was no factor. MARGIE'S MONEY , along the rail down the

 on the turn, failed to be a factor and weakened. DROPS AND BUCKETS , outrun, swung to the seven path in upper stretch. EIGHTY SIX METS raced in the

 Footnotes
 STRUTH , with the pace four wide outside a pair of rivals, moved clear after being asked past the five sixteenths, responded to strong right handed
 encouragement inside the three sixteenths and powered away. LEWISFIELD dueled inside foes, came off the rail in upper stretch, drifted back in near the
 sixteenth marker, switched to his left lead but kept on gamely to be well clear of the rest. WINPLACEORSHOWONO chased the pace five wide, dropped
 back some mid turn, continued five wide for the drive and had a bit of late life to nab the show. IT'S THE JOURNEY , away alertly, eased back off the
 leaders nearing the turn, came under pressure past the three eighths while off the rail but failed to respond. NOTEWORTHY PEACH saved ground, made a
 mild run into the stretch then flattened out. SHOWALTER broke slowly, rushed up soon after and dueled between runners, stayed on to the three sixteenths
 then weakened. TALK SHOW MAN lacked speed while off the rail, was under pressure mid turn, swung out entering the lane, altered back in near mid
 stretch and had belated interest. SONNY INSPIRED , three to four wide, failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 NICO BREE N TEEJ stalked the pace, advanced three deep to secure command entering the stretch and drew off under brisk, left hand urging. ALIGN THE
 NUMBERS sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was no match for the winner through the stretch and was best of the others. PAID HOLIDAY
 chased the pace two wide and weakened. SPARTY , swung to the four path leaving the turn and lacked a rally in an even effort. BAD ANGLE BURKE , two
 wide leaving the turn, lacked a rally. PAPPILLON , three wide leaving the turn, raced on his left lead in the stretch and was no factor. STOMP DANCE was
 outrun. JACKGREERSTUBHUTCH , along the inner rail on the turn, gave way. CHARISMATIC BLUE trailed.
