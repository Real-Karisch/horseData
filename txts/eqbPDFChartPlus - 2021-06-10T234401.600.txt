 GENERAL IKE was on the pace from the outset, got fanned out to the four path by MIRROR IMAGE on the turn, pushed clear to mid stretch and held
 driving. JENS DE VILLE chased the leaders to the turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch, shifted out for room in upper stretch and finished well for the
 place. MIRROR IMAGE dueled inside the winner and three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then could not save the place. ROCKET FUEL
 chased the pace to the turn, circled five wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. FAST SALE had no speed and was never a threat. BUTTE CITY
 was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 SHE'S NO FOOL was always well placed, responded four wide on the second turn, pushed to the front in mid stretch and held on stubbornly. NORTHERN
 ROSE stalked the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then also responded in the drive but was outkicked by the winner but saved the
 place. PERFECT EDITION set the pace for six furlongs three wide, was overtaken in upper stretch and lost the place in the late stages. FABULOUS STAR
 had no speed, settled for a half mile, was three wide to the stretch then got outfinished in the final furlong. TIZ YOUR WAY was four wide to the backstretch,
 tracked to the second turn but was forced out to the five path to the stretch and weakened in the drive. WHY ARE U SO SWEET broke awkwardly and took
 up off heels in the first few strides then had no speed and was not a factor. MISS SWISH chased the pace for a half mile then tired.
