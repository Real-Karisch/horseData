 Footnotes
 GEMOLOGISTER raced in the mix through opening stages then continued a bid racing just off the top two leaders around the turn, sustained outside bid
 through stretch run and drew clear late. RATTLE'M dueled for the early lead, continued to battle racing outside of SILENT TIGER around the turn and into
 stretch run, dug in gamely then had no closing kick in reserve and captured place in final stride. SILENT TIGER dueled for the lead out of the gate,
 continued to battle racing inside of RATTLE'M around the turn and into stretch run, kept on with game response then lacked a closing kick and got edged for
 place in final stride. KRAMMY BOY raced off the early speed then hustled along four wide around the turn, continued a bid racing along the outside through
 the lane and failed to threaten. SIGHTED raced in mix while hung out wide in opening stages, roused three wide around the turn and into upper stretch then
 failed to keep pace. PLEA BARGAIN was off to a good start but lacked the early foot to move, dropped off the pace and raced along inside through early
 stages, angled to outside in stretch run and failed to respond. OUR PRIDE lacked speed and saved ground to no avail.

 Footnotes
 UNION RICHES saved ground around the first turn then rated off the top two clear leaders down the backstretch, came under mild prompting and advanced
 on the leader around the far turn, roused forward under left handed pressure in upper stretch, took command and finished clear. MR DEWEY secured inside
 position and led the way around the first turn, set the uncontested pace down backstretch and widened to clear advantage while still in hand around the far
 turn, put to a drive at head of the lane but could not hold off the bid from UNION RICHES. SOUTHERN SEA saved ground around the first turn then rated
 along inside down the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, was no match for top pair but dug in gamely to edge out foes for share.
 SHIDOSHI was unhurried and saved ground down the backstretch, picked up the pace in the far turn then kept under steady urging two wide and got edged
 out for show. CHIEF WHITE SOX settled and saved ground through early stages, launched a bid near the quarter pole, continued with response three to
 four wide in the lane and lacked the needed response for late impact. GRAN GREYFROST raced off the pace, hustled up around the far turn then put to a
 drive four to five wide in the lane and needed more for impact. MASON'S SONG raced four wide around the first turn then settled off the early pace, hustled
 up three wide around the far turn and into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. SIDNEY'S CHARISMA was forwardly placed in the first turn, chased after
 the leader while clear over the next pursuer down the backstretch, failed to gain around the far turn then faded in the lane. TIDE OF THE DESERT raced
 four wide entering the first turn, raced in the back and failed to respond when called upon. Run up distance unavailable

 SUN SQUALL was off to a good start and gained a forward position then tracked three wide through the backstretch, hustled up and raced between foes at
 the quarter pole then continued a bid under steady pressure through stretch run and drove by late. PARLAY PETE sped to the lead and continued to save
 ground while holding firm around the turn, roused for more in upper stretch then came under left urging while racing along the rail and got outkicked in final
 stages. MAN OF VISION was off a step slow then rushed up and steadied a bit leaving the five eighths pole, hustled along three to four wide around the turn
 then stayed on with response for show. UNCAPTURED KING raced up close and chased after the leader around the turn then failed to keep pace and gave
 way in the lane. AT THE BEACH lacked early foot and saved ground through early stages, angled out and hustled along five wide in stretch run and lacked
 the needed response for impact. HE'S ON THE FLY raced five wide off the early speed, roused for response along outside around the turn then lacked
 further response in the lane. SHAKEM N BREAKEM raced off the pace and four wide into upper stretch to no avail. LAST JET OUT chased in range through

 Footnotes
 COLONELS DAUGHTER settled nicely while rated just off the inside down the backstretch, saved ground moving through the far turn then angled out
 turning for home, set down for the drive four wide under firm handling and got up in time. ADMIRAL'S WIN raced off the leader under firm rating down the
 backstretch, launched a two wide bid and advanced up to challenge CALLIE CALIFORNIA for the lead in the far turn, took slim lead turning for home,
 continued to dig in on top under pressure and got edged out late. STARSHIP TRIBBLES was forwardly positioned and raced under firm rating through early
 stages, saved ground then angled out three wide and headed in pursuit leaving the far turn, edged up closer in late stages then raced between foes nearing
 the wire. CALLIE CALIFORNIA cleared and crossed over to inside in the first turn, set the pace and saved ground down the backstretch, challenged for the
 lead by ADMIRAL'S WIN around the far turn, got headed for the lead but fought back in upper stretch then gave way in final furlong. FANTASTIC KINGDOM
 was allowed to settle in early stages and raced in the back, came under left handed pressure and shifted out five wide at head of the lane, improved position
 but needed more for late impact. HOTTY TODDY settled and saved ground through early stages, roused for response upon entering the far turn and kept
 under steady urging into the lane but failed to kick on. BALADA hopped at the start, stalked the pace positioned outside of a rival through the backstretch
 then failed to move on when called upon in the far turn. FINAL FLURRY raced off the pace then hustled along through the far turn and failed to rally.

 then finished determinedly and got up late. A I INITIATIVE raced in range down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, advanced
 and dueled for the lead at eighth pole then gained a brief slim lead, dug in and got edged out in final strides. NAUGHTY cleared and crossed over to inside
 entering the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, continued to hold on top around the far turn, dueled for the lead at the eighth pole, failed to kick on
 but stayed on for share. JOHNNYTHETIREMAN rated along inside through early stages, came under a ride along the rail around the far turn, cut the corner
 then continued in striking range upper stretch then gave way. BARBIE'S KING raced off the early pace, hustled up two wide around the far turn then kept on
 three wide in stretch run and lacked the needed kick for late impact. TARANTO stalked the pace down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around
 the far turn then weakened in the lane. SHIP LOCK was forwardly placed and stalked the leader through early stages, came under a ride two wide in the far
 turn then faded in the lane. MICAH MAN raced off the pace then urged for response along the rail in the far turn but failed to kick on. MANO raced off the
 pace and saved ground to no avail. ARCH STAR failed to respond. ITS AN EXPERIENCE was outrun. Run up distance unavailable
