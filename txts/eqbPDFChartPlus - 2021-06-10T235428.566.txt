 Footnotes
 CASE CRACKER cruised to the lead, took token pressure from FLIN FLON in the opening quarter, slipped clear of that foe near the half mile marker, led
 through the turn in the two path, opened up when pushed along in hand, and was wrapped up in the final fifty yards when the race's result was no mystery.
 NOOK settled near the rear inside, chased in the two path through the far turn and into the stretch, split horses and improved under a drive past the three
 sixteenths marker, and gained late while ridden out once her stablemate went under wraps. CHURCH ROAD tracked the early pace two wide, was urged in
 the four path through the turn, fanned into the stretch in the five path, and made mild improvement in the lane. DANDY GAL stumbled in the opening strides,
 tracked the pace inside, saved ground through the far turn and into the stretch, but ran only evenly late. FLIN FLON was pushed to stay with CASE
 CRACKER early, provided token pressure until the half mile marker, was shoved along in the three path around the turn after the leader slipped clear, and
 had no response. MEADOW MYSTIQUE settled near the rear two wide down the backstretch, trailed in the four path on the turn, came into the stretch in the
 five path, and offered no rally. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THERE WAS NO 3/4 MILE TIME.

 Footnotes
 SINGINGINTHEHEAT broke sharply, was grazed by FLASHDANCE ROAD in the opening strides, continued unfazed and gained the lead comfortably,
 continued unchallenged on the front while saving ground through the turn, and held safe while under a drive in the final furlong. NUN THE LESS chased two
 wide on the backstretch, took the turn in the three path near the three eighths marker and gradually went further wide, fanned into the stretch in the seven
 path, rallied three wide and chipped away at the leader's advantage through the final furlong. VOODOO SPELL chased the pace, saved ground through the
 turn and into the stretch, slipped through on the rail near the furlong marker and got up for show. CASHEL ROCK tracked the pace inside, saved ground
 through the turn while stalking in range, but ran only evenly late while under a drive. WAGON BOSS was pinched back in the opening strides, settled inside
 near the rear, saved ground through the turn and into the stretch, angled off the rail near the three sixteenths and rolled along belatedly. HALF OF
 MANHATTAN hit the gate, settled at the rear, trailed in the two path around the turn, and was no factor. FLASHDANCE ROAD broke slightly outward and
 grazed SINGINGINTHEHEAT in the opening strides, stalked the pace two wide, was pushed to keep up in the three path through the far turn, but weakened
 between horses from the three sixteenths.

 Footnotes
 STROLLIN THE BAYOU vied for the lead on the inside then settled to stalk the pace, angled out at the three eighths pole and bumped into MISS BLUE
 DOT, took the rest of the turn going three wide, drew off when asked and won under wraps. AVA ATTICUS dwelt a bit in the gate then trailed the field,
 angled out at the three sixteenths pole and gained from there. DON'T HOLD QUEENS sat well rated between horses going two wide around the turn, swung
 into the stretch in the five path then unraveled an outside rally for show. FASHION'S TOUCH ran towards the rear while on the rail, angled out at the five
 sixteenths pole then went back to the inside at the quarter pole, found no room there so angled out again at the eighth pole then went back to the rail at the
 sixteenth pole then gained from there. SCARLET BOW brushed with MISS BLUE DOT near the five eighths pole but was unfazed, sat well rated off the
 pace on the inside but lacked the needed rally. MISS BLUE DOT brushed with SCARLEY BOW at the five eighths pole but was unfazed, tracked the pace
 while going two wide, got bumped by STROLLIN THE BAYOU at the three eighths pole and entered the stretch going four wide, was full of run initially but
 faltered. DANCING NORA sat well rated off the pace while going two wide around the turn, swung into the stretch in the five path but had no response when
 asked. MORE MONIQUE vied for the lead on the outside going into the turn three wide but came up two wide then folded up at the quarter pole. HELEN

 JAX HERITAGE took the first turn on the rail while running towards the rear, went into the two path turning for home running gamely down the stretch, got
 through at the sixteenth pole and prevailed. MAS MISCHIEF went two wide around the first turn while sitting well rated off the pace, found a spot on the rail
 turning for home, angled out at the three sixteenths pole and unleashed a rally from there. SUSPENDERS had the rail around both turns while tracking the
 pace, rallied gamely between horses through the stretch, took a brief lead at the sixteenth pole but was sniped on the line by closers. SUPERMANS CAPE
 skipped clear from foes while hugging the rail the whole way, dug in when asked for more and finished gamely. ROAR OF THE LION ran towards the rear
 while going two wide around both turns, entered the stretch in the three path with a rally and finished with a good effort. SACRED LEGACY sat well rated off
 the pace while on the inside but lacked the needed rally. RIO SECO tracked the pace on the inside, went two wide turning for home but lacked a rally. KING
 OF THE SCORE was a bit rank as the field passed the finish the first time, went around the first turn in the two path while tracking the pace on the outside,
 went three wide turning for home then entered the stretch in the four path but had no response.

 sixteenths pole with a rally then swooped past the field at the sixteenth pole. KASAQUI (ARG) brushed with COCO MON at the start but shrugged it off,
 went three wide around the first turn while stalking the pace on the outside, maintained his position and went two wide turning for home running all out down
 the stretch and finishing with a good effort. APPLICATOR angled out at the seven eighths pole and went two wide around the first turn, vied for the lead at
 the three quarters pole and took control of the pace after half a mile, held the lead into the stretch running gamely down the lane but got sniped for place.
 OAK BROOK had a clear lead in the early stages, dug in when collared at the three quarters pole and stayed forwardly placed turning for home, gave way
 at the three eighths pole but showed a mild response inside the three sixteenths pole. COCO MON got jostled around a bit at the start by CAMMACK and
 KASAQUI but shook it off, sat well rated off the pace while on the rail, went two wide turning for home to finish evenly. CREWMAN was reluctant to load but
 broke well, trailed the whole way while in the two path.

 then had a late rally down the lane. PAINT THE CORNERS sat well rated off the pace while on the inside, turned for home in the two path and finished
 evenly. SOME SAY SO chased the pace throughout while in the two path then retreated. SHELBYSMILE was allowed to settle off the pace while going

 Footnotes
 OCTACATO took the rail around the first bend while sitting well rated off the pace, swung for home going two wide then went three wide into the stretch,
 rallied well, drew off once he took command and drifted out through the finish. HIDE AND STREET went around the first turn on the rail while tracking the
 pace, maintained his position then went three wide turning for home, took a brief lead at the top of the stretch and dug in to hold on but was overwhelmed by
 the winner inside the final furlong. DANCING HIGH ran towards the rear while on the rail, stayed glued to the inside but swung into the three path at the top
 of the stretch and closed with a rush with a furlong to go. ATLANTIC GULCH lugged in at the start helping to pinch ATRUEVISION back, ran towards the
 rear while on the rail, stayed toward the inside then his hole closed in at the eight pole, angled out and rallied from there. TURNED BACK TWICE brushed
 with CALL ME CORAGEOUS at the start but was unfazed, tracked the pace while going tow and three wide around the turns, swung into the stretch going
 four wide then had a long rally down the lane. ATRUEVISION broke in a tangle then got pinched back, trailed the field while running in the two or three path,
 responded well when asked for more and closed in vain. KARA'S ANGEL sat well rated off the pace while on the inside then finished evenly. HURRACA ran
 towards the rear while running in the two path around the turns, swung into the stretch in the four path but lacked a rally. CALL ME COURAGEOUS brushed
 with TURNED BACK TWICE at the start but shook it off, sat well rated off the pace while in the two path then had no response. JE SUIS BELLE chased the
 pace on the rail, vied for the lead at the three eighths pole going two wide but folded up at the quarter pole. REMINISCE took the first turn in the two path
 while going straight to the front, maintained the lead into the turn but was spent by the eighth pole.
