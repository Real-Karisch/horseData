 Footnotes
 COUZINS GONE WILD broke in the air then was bumped soundly by COOPER'S MARCK, advanced early between horses, raced the three path around
 the turn, took over after five furlongs and was clear under urging. OFF THE RAILS took command at once, stayed out from the inside once clear midway on
 the turn and couldn't stay late with the winner. STORY SPINNER was unhurried following a slow break, angled to the rail midway on the turn then angled
 out through the lane with a belated run. COOPER'S MARCK ducked out into the winner leaving the gate, pressed inside the early leader, angled to the rail
 entering the turn then tired in the lane. ALL HANDS UP wasn't far back in the three path to the stretch then tired. LET ME SLEEP ON IT raced three wide
 around the turn and failed to menace. CITY COUNT was wide and outrun. SON OF APOLLO briefly showed speed inside, came out two wide on the turn
 and stopped. OPTICIAN showed little.

 Footnotes
 PHIL'S COCKTAIL pushed the pace early on then took the lead turning for home, was challenged on the outside and dueled with HOT SQUAD well into the
 stretch, ran gamely then edged away from foe. HOT SQUAD stalked the pace on the outside going four wide around the turn, made a bid for the lead at the
 quarter pole then ran gamely through the drive but was on match for the winner. CHILEAN BROTHERS ducked in at the start bumping with BRASSY BEN,
 recovered to stalk the pace between horses then finished evenly. BRASSY BEN bumped at the start with CHILEAN BROTHERS, tracked the pace while
 going three wide into the stretch, angled in at the eighth pole looking for running room then had a mild rally. LEE'S SOUTH stalked the pace between horses
 going three wide around the turn then finished evenly. TEXAS TEX was allowed to settle off the pace, turned for home going four wide to finish evenly.
 OGERMEISTER stalked the pace down on the inside but grew tired. THIS GUNS FOR HIRE passed tiring rivals. MEDALLICIOUS went wide around the
 turn and showed little. WHO IS THE GIANT led early on then buckled when collared at the quarter pole.

 ducked out into BENANTI just after the break, chased the early leader, moved two wide to command midway on the final turn but was outfinished after a stiff
 drive. SHE'S HOLY steadied along the rail entering the first turn, was unhurried, swung out entering the stretch then closed a gap late while bearing out
 under left hand whip. DECADENT DOLL settled in the two path but couldn't gain. NEW FREEDOM angled to the inside while moving to a clear lead into the
 first turn, remained in control into the far turn then weakened. BENANTI was bumped leaving the gate then trailed.

 under mild urging. EASTERN FRONT moved to vie two wide between horses on the final turn but couldn't match the winner. JUMP STREET HERO was
 shuffled back from between horses leaving the gate, made a run along the rail around the final turn then flattened out. PRINCE OF THE LAKE moved clear
 into the first turn, made the pace along the rail for just over three quarters then tired. ACCELERATO was outrun three wide. JIDDI I DON'T KNOW stopped.

 Footnotes
 PERSIE went four wide around the first turn while tracking the pace, vied for the lead at the top of the stretch and dug in when asked for more and got up in
 time. BIG JOE CANDY took the lead right away and held it comfortably well into the turn for home, got collared at the top of the stretch and lost ground to
 the winner but found another gear and fought back to just miss the win. THEYALLCOMEHOME ran towards the rear most of the way then uncorked a
 strong run with a furlong to go. KING J chased the pace along the inside around the first turn but swung out into the four path turning for home then faded.
 AWESOME ALEX went three wide around both turns while chasing the pace then faded. JOEY CAP ran in the middle of the pack, swung wide turning for
 home and uncorked a rally. HAITIAN HILL went three wide around the first turn while sitting well rated off the pace, turned for home near the five path and
 finished evenly. PLEASE PLAY AGAIN got squeezed out of position nearing the three quarters pole and had to be taken up, stayed towards the rear then
 finished evenly. HE'S FROM QUEENS went wide around both turns and was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack but lacked a rally. GOLD WING had
 no response.
