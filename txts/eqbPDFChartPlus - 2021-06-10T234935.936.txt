 reached a forward position entering the drive, responded and rallied late for the place. RAPID LADY forced the early pace from the inside, inched closer
 entering the second turn, held a forward position for the drive but could not keep pace. TIFFANY OFTHE NILE chased the early pace outside but had

 Footnotes
 FLATTER UP dueled from the outside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, shook loose entering the drive and was well clear while under steady
 urging. OVERTHEGARDENGATE dueled from the inside early, battled with the winner up the backstretch, remained forward but was no match while
 holding position. NADIA ANNE stalked the early pace from the outside, advanced through the second turn but could only gain the show. FIJI D pressed the
 early pace from the outside but had no late response. PINKER BELL was no factor. MINE YOURS AN OURS chased the early pace and tire. BLING IT ON
 BABY vied from the inside and faded.
