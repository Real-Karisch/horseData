 Footnotes
 DRESSED IN HEELS away alertly, made the lead leaving the chute, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best
 while in hand. I GOT THE TIME never far back, offered a bi between horses two wide nearing the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner while
 well clear for second. LIL LUCILLE stalked the pace along the inside and went evenly. GRAB THE CASH chased the winner two wide into the stretch then
 faded. LONNIE BELL stalked the pace three wide and was through after a half. BELIEF was no factor. MAMA ZEE was no threat.

 Footnotes
 SEA THIEF stalked the pace from the second flight in the four path, responded readily when set down four wide through the stretch and got up in the final
 strides. MR LIGHTNING BOY dueled for the lead along the inside in the two path into the stretch, drifted out a bit, had his heels clipped before the furlong
 marker, bumped with LITTLE TRICK near the eighth pole, dug in determinedly and just missed hanging on. ABRAHAM was on the runner ups heels along
 the inside on the clubhouse turn, tracked the leaders along the inside into the stretch, drifted out a bit, clipped heels with the runner up past the three
 sixteenths pole, dropped inside and finished with good courage. LITTLE TRICKS battled for the lead two wide into the stretch, bumped near the furlong
 marker, fought determinedly through the final stages and checked nearing the wire. VAN DAMME unhurried early, closed a gap late five wide. MORE THAN
 GOOD trailed into the first turn, inched closer between horses two wide on the far turn then failed to sustain his bid.

 clear under left handed urging. SEEKING A JEWEL broke in front, set a pressured pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the four path and finsihed
 second best. HAREM'S CAT hopped and hit the side of the gate at the start, trailed far back into the turn then closed a gap late in the three path. MY
 LITTLE LILY close early, dropped back on the turn, swung out to the six path entering the stretch then passed tiring rivals late. VOLUME ONE stalked the
 pace into the stretch then faded. MY PEGGY LOU had brief speed.
