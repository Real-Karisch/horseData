 Footnotes
 WIN THE WAR raced well back from the early leaders, advanced into contention a half-mile out, pressed the leader while racing two-wide on the turn, made
 the lead past the 1/4 pole and drew clear with ease. GRACE AND DIGNITY dueled at a frantic tempo for the opening 1/4, shook clear past the 5/8ths pole,
 began to take some pressure from WIN THE WAR midway around the turn, was headed by that foe past the 1/4 pole and was no match down the stretch.
 PERFECTION CAT was well back from the leaders early, remained unhurried as others advanced towards the front, had one beaten on the turn, angled off
 of the rail at the 1/8th pole and got up for show. STAR HUNTER was off a bit slowly, had one beaten early, split foes at the 9/16ths pole as she advanced
 into contention, stalked the leaders on the turn, chased down the stretch and lost show at the wire. MADAME X. trailed the field, raced two and three-wide
 on the turn and passed a tiring foe in the stretch. ENCHANTED TALE dueled for the opening 1/4, quickly fell back past the 5/8ths pole and was empty in the
 stretch.
