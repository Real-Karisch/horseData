 Footnotes
 DRILL TIME moved inward on the turn, raced between rivals briefly in upper stretch then finished well inside while drawing clear. DIXIE PULPIT bumped at
 the start, raced up close on the turn three wide, was in the four path entering the lane and finished gamely for the place. CHAMPSACHAMP prompted the
 early issue, moved to the front on the turn and raced in the three path into the stretch then continued on willingly to the wire while having to settle for the
 show award. DUDE'S DUDE broke in, raced four wide into the lane and was gaining late. CHIEF A CHIEF'S vied inside and weakened in the drive. RAGS
 TO RAGS brushed slightly at the start, trailed and had no rally.

 Footnotes
 CIRCUS RIDE dueled two wide to the turn, drew off and extended his lead while ridden out. PUT YOUR PANTS ON was never far off the pace, went four
 wide entering the stretch, closed steadily to earn place and was no match for the winner. BULLET EXPRESS bobbled at the start, raced inside, angled out
 in the upper stretch and offered a mild bid to get up for show. LIL BIT OF THUNDER stalked the pace, came up empty late and was caught for show.
 COMPLETE CIRCLE broke slowly, was unhurried early, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival under mild urging. BELLELARO vied for the lead while
 racing along the rail, fell back on the turn and stopped mid stretch.

 EXECUTIVE DECREE challenged between horses on the turn, assumed command, inched clear, was under pressure through the stretch and held under
 steady urging. BLUE LAW set a pressured pace, was headed on the turn, went willingly to the wire and couldn't get by the winner. QUIET BUT DEADLY
 was slow early, shifted out for the drive and offered a mild bid to get up late for show. ROYAL PRIVACY broke awkwardly, pressed the pace while racing
 inside and stopped mid stretch. MR DEJAVU was pulled up and vanned off. PER RULING # 19-20TP038 FROM THE ARIZONA RACING COMMISSION,
 MR DEJAVU IS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

 SIX POINT RACK took up a stalking position on the backstretch, eased off the inside on the far turn and reached the pacesetter entering the lane then drew
 off while being hand urged. SHIRL'S READY saved ground, was asked for run on the far turn, moved out during the stretch run and finished steadily while
 earning the place. IMPETU drew well clear early, showed the way to the lane and weakened in the drive. SPIRIT MISSION between foes early, raced just
 off the inside into the far turn, moved out and lacked a bid. POINT GUARD three wide on the backstretch, raced in the five path into the lane and had no
 rally. The quarter-mile fractional split was hand timed.
