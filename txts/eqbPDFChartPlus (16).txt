 Footnotes
 MIDNIGHT DISGUISE took the three path pursuing the front runners on the turn, was switched over to stronger handling spinning approximaely five wide
 into the stretch, straightened away and kicked into her best, out-fought rivals to her inside to poke a head in front by the beginning of the firnal furlong,
 continued onward with good energy and edged away. DREAM FEVER settled into the three path after an apparent clean getaway, vied as the widest of
 three for command for much of the opening half, inched up to strike the top as the half was being completed, was put to a drive a few jumps later, failed to
 shake free, and was instead reeled in by the winner soon afterwards, held on well once collared to secure second. RIGHT ON broke slightly to the outside,
 eventually making light contact with an incoming RAPID ROUTE in the shadow of the starting gate, led the field by a slim margin gradually working its way
 towards the inside on the backstretch, continued on the front end leaving the half mile pile, facing pressure from a pair of foes parked out in paths two and
 three respectively, got headed as the second fraction was in the process of being posted, held on stubbornly for the next eighth before weakening. RAPID
 ROUTE went briefly shoulder to shoulder with RIGHT ON after losing her footing springing from the gate, contended for control mainly two wide and from
 between opponents for the inital half before giving way. BLUSHING JUSTINE saw the pilot grab hold after ducking in at the start, tracked the front runners
 towards the rail until the end of the bend, angled four wide for the drive home, failed to fire appreciably. TARAWA strung out four wde, the widest of all on
 the turn, gave way.

 Footnotes
 WONDERFUL LIGHT bobbled at the start, chased six wide down the backstretch, advanced four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
 three-eighths challenging a pair to his inside that consisted of SWITZERLAND and SEETHISQUICK, swung three wide into upper stretch, edged away
 under a drive kept to task. SWITZERLAND dueled with SEETHISQUICK to his inside while in the five path down the backstretch, tucked three wide through
 the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as the aforementioned foe advanced outside and shook off SEETHISQUICK in tandem nearing the
 five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, got shaken off himself and kept on for the place honors. PRESERVATIONIST broke in at the start bumping
 FREELOAD into VIA CASTAGNA and pinching back FREELOAD between foes, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide
 through the turn coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths, continued five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. SEETHISQUICK hustled from the
 gate, dueled from the four path down the backstretch with SWITZERLAND to his outside while coaxed along, tucked two to three wide through the turn
 under challenge now from a pair at the three-eighths, got displaced and shaken off chasing through the latter portion of the bend and swinging four wide at
 the quarter pole before tiring in the stretch. VIA CASTAGNA bumped at the start by FREELOAD due to pressure from PRESERVATIONIST who broke
 inwards, chased six wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, went five to six wide at the head
 of the stretch and made no impact. FREELOAD got bumped at the start by PRESERVATIONIST and was pinched back against VIA CASTAGNA conceding
 two to three lengths to the front, chased four to five wide under encouragement from the three-eighths, swung five to six wide for home and trailed
 throughout.

 Footnotes
 LAND MINE sparred for command in the two path from between rivals for the initial half, was still in reserve edging away from the competition during the run
 around the bend, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker before finally called upon for more, mustered up a willing response and drew off
 convincingly. LITERATA off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from the three path, went about the bend being heavily roused, stepped into the
 stretch and proved no match. NO HAYNE NO GAYNE in the three path, pressed the issue as the widest of a trio for the opening half before going at it one
 on one with the top one for much of the journey on the turn, gave way after completing three-quarters. UNREPENTED remained along the rail after the
 break, argued for command inside two others to the top of the bend, began to fall back even after being asked for more leaving the half mile pole, fell back
 even more rapidly down the lane. PEACHES AND SPICE used on the chute, proceeded along in a sluggish manner nevertheless, pursued the pace four
 wide on the turn while never making its presence felt.

 Footnotes
 B THREE stepped off the backstretch positioned four wide, inched up towards the front runners making its way on the bend, was given her cue challenging
 in earnest spinning into the lane, out-fought a pair of foes for the top during the ensuing furlong and kicked clear. VOTRE COEUR sat forwardly placed
 towards the inside, and would be the lone member of this sextet to spend significant time along the inside route, argued for control as the innermost of three
 on the turn, under a brsk hand ride while going about the task, was in possession of its largest lead as three-quarters was being reached, relinquished once
 the winner was put to a drive during the portion of the stretch leading up to the furlong grounds, won the fight with COREY Q to procure the place. COREY
 Q settled into the three path after the break, contended as the widest of a threesome during the run around the bend, made it into the stretch, failed to claim
 the advantage then lost out on place honors. GIANT ENDING broke prominently and retained its spot in the vanguard, got guided over into the the two path,
 failed to protect the lead sandwiched between foes on the turn, steadily backed away after going six furlongs. STARS WILBURN took up the chase from the
 two path, responded with a display of brief foot in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole only to have it fizzle out after coming into the stretch.
 QUANIQUE three wide and roused on the turn, gave way.

 Footnotes
 MILAYA established the front shortly after the start and showed the way three then two wide in hand under some pressure from flanking rivals, came under
 coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, kicked on safe to the eighth pole under growing threat to the outside, dug in as that rival
 latched on nearing the sixteenth marker gamely to repel the challenge and get the nose down on the wire. MIDNIGHT BOUNTY chased just off the inside in
 close aim of the leader, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, angled out to spin three wide at the quarter pole,
 rallied to latch on the leader nearing the sixteenth pole dueling through to the finish in game fashion but was ultimately rebuffed at the wire while well clear of
 the rest. AREWEHAVINGFUNYET seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased four to five wide through the turn under a ride from the
 three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. DOINWHATSHELIKES chased three to four wide under a ride from three furlongs out,
 continued four wide for home, tired. MARNESIA BIG GIRL prompted the pace five to six wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn
 under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and faltered. MADAME BARBARIAN eight paths off the rail down the backstretch,
 chased five wide through the turn ridden along from three furlongs out, went five to six wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. NAVAJO
 KITTEN chased two to three wide pushed along from the midway point on the turn, cornered three to four wide for home, trailed.

 Footnotes
 BREE'S GOT HEART got spotted into the three path after the start, contended as the widest of three nearly all the way to the end of the bend, got engaged
 in a duel with the runner up as the pair stepped into the lane, took over the lead, being the more confidently-handled of that matchup, kicked clear,
 continuing to be asked, but at no time fully so. SATIN SHEETS stayed along the rail after the break, was the innermost of a trio vying for command until the
 quarter pole, saw the pilot go to work coming up to the quarter pole, relinquished nonetheless to the top one, then kept going well enough afterwards to nail
 down the place. KITTY MADDNES cut over to the rail in short order, tracked the front runners having been put to solid encouragement by midpoint on the
 turn, swung three wide into the lane and went on to rally mildly for third. TIZ A KITTEN huslted from the gate, failed to shake free, and was instead forced to
 dispute the pace from the two path in the middle of the top twosome, continued along under that set-up to the final legs of the trip around the bend before
 giving way. PUPAREE bobbled at the start, travelled three to four wide on the turn, the widest of all, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch,
 however having lost its status of being the widest of all, failed to make its presence felt. OVER MY HEAD three wide on the turn, got ridden into path seven
 from upper to midlane to no avail.

 WEGOTOLDYOUGOTSOLD shied out at the start reacting to the stumble of C K DEXTER HAVEN to his inside, chased four wide down the backstretch,
 tucked to the three path and was bumped around a bit by MAIMO tucking in from the outside just inside the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole from an embattled pair and edged away under a drive
 kept to task to the wire. I'M AN OCALA DUDE vied inside a pair down the backstretch and into the turn before being shaken off seven-sixteenths from
 home, remained patiently handled in behind rivals through the turn backing away a bit, got put to light coaxing spinning just off the inside for home, tipped
 out nearing the eighth pole roused and offered up a mild kick to come again and secure the place honors. BLINDED VISION broke out at the start bumping
 A J'S WAY into REIGN CHARGER, vied between foes from the two path down the backstretch, had MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS just clear and tuck over inside
 the nine-sixteenths and was put to a hold off heels of that rival briefly half a mile from home, gained clearance put to coaxing three furlongs out advancing to
 issue a challenge nearing the quarter pole spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in gaining to be on near even terms with the leader when displaced
 by the eventual winner nearing the eighth pole, then kept on for the show honors. BIG THICKET six wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the
 turn coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position through the drive to garner the last
 major share. C K DEXTER HAVEN stumbled awkwardly at the start pekcing the ground and conceding two to three lengths to the front coming under
 coaxing to close that gap, chased three then two wide, got ridden along three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch offering up a mild bid,
 couldn't sustain it and weakened in the late stages. MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS vied three wide outside a pair early on, tucked to the two path when just
 clearing BLINDED VISION at the nine-sixteenths forcing that rival to be taken in hand briefly off heels, shook off I'M AN OCALA DUDE near the
 seven-sixteenths to show the way alone briefly tucked inside at the three-eighths, came under pressure once more from BLINDED VISION nearing the
 quarter pole under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, got displaced in tandem with that danger by the eventual winner
 nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late going. REIGN CHARGER bumped at the start by A J'S WAY due to pressure from BLINDED VISION,
 chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at tyhe seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
 for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. A J'S WAY bumped at the start by BLINDED VISION and in turn bumped REIGN CHARGER, chased three
 wide under a ride from the midway point on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. ALL GOLDEN got forced to
 check off the heels of SIDEWINDER who veered in when recovering from a stumble and altered awkwardly outwards two paths as MAIMO bhad broken
 outwards sealing off the inside path conceding six to seven lengths to the front, crossed to the inside shortly after and chased detached at the tail of the
 field, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, tipped out two to three wide, swung four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MAIMO broke
 out at the start bumping with the recovering SIDEWINDER who veered in after stumbling, chased five wide in striking range of the front before tucking four
 wide at the half mile pole and bumping WEGOTOLDYOUGOTSOLD inside that station, came under coaxing midway on the turn, swung four to five wide
 into upper stretch and faltered. SIDEWINDER stumbled at the start veering inwards when recovering and bumping with MAIMO who broke outwards and in
 turn forced ALL GOLDEN to steady and alter off his heels in behind, chased seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four
 wide into the turn, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, continued four wide at the quarter pole and made no impact.
