 BLURRED LINE broke in at the start bumping INFIELD IS IN, then got bumped solidly back by that rival due to pressure from COOKIE CRISP, chased five
 wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latching on to the outside of a pair a furlong out,
 battled on surging in the final strides to get up in the shadow of the wire and prevail. COOKIE CRISP bobbled at the start recovering outwards and bumping
 INFIELD IS IN into the aforementioned foe, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, rallied to issue a
 challenge through the final furlong latching on to the inside of a pair, took narrow command a sixteenth from home but was nailed in the very last strides to
 the wire. ROCKIN JO broke out at the start and was corrected, spurted away to show the way three wide down the backstretch and through the turn coming
 under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under growing threat and held stubbornly between foes until
 headed a sixteenth out, then fought on to the finish while safe for the show honors. INDUSTRIAL LOGIC bumped at the start by COOKIE CRISP due to
 pressure outside from BLURRED LINE, chased just off the inside until tucked inside put to coaxing at the nine-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper
 stretch and offered up a mild bid. INFIELD IS IN bumped between foes at the start, chased four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path
 into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in the late stages. SAVE THE SANGRIA six paths off the

 five then four wide through the turn stacking outside a trio at the three-eighths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three to four wide into
 upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of the rest and second best. MISS NANCY five wide down the backstretch, chased
 four then three wide advancing to be stacked outside the top pair between rivals joined to the outside by the aforementioned rival, came under coaxing at
 the five-sixteenths, swung four wide at the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. WOUNDWITHHEREYES chased inside early on lacking optimal room
 inside of OWESAYCANYOUSEE, got the seam and advanced under light coaxing to take command with nine-sixteenths to go, showed the way in hand and
 was headed nearing the three-eighths, remained patiently handled through the latter portion of the turn, cut the corner in behind the eventual winner and
 weakened under a light drive. OWESAYCANYOUSEE led early on just off the inside, got headed by the aforementioned foe nine-sixteenths from home,
 while remaining just off that rival, advanced once more put to light coaxed to take back command three furlongs from home, came under urging at the
 five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch yielding the front and tired. DIAMOND PLAY chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
 three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

 EGO two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, closed well to take
 command a sixteenth from home and inched away to the finish kept to task. RISKY SOUR bumped between foes at the start, chased three wide from mid
 pack until tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home, offered up a mild kick to
 willingly pick up the place honors. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN broke out at the start bumping RISKY SOUR into CUMULATIVE, advanced to establish the
 front crossing to show the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in safe to the
 eighth pole, got collared a sixteenth from home and was along for the show honors. JO'S BOLD CAT chased just off the inside from near the rear, came
 under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. TEN EYCK four then three wide in
 pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled out eight wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. MALIBU STRINGS tracked the pace along
 the inside, came under coaxing and cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a tepid drive with a clear seam up the rail a furlong from home, couldn't
 quicken to get through the seam coming up empty when asked, then weakened in the final furlong. RIVER KNIGHT forwardly placed just off the inside,
 came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in the late stages. CUMULATIVE broke in at the start and was
 bumped solidly by RISKY SOUR due to pressure from THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN losing the off side iron and racing six paths off the inside through the
 opening dog legged turn, chased five to six wide down the backstretch getting back in the irons, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went nine
 wide into upper stretch and weakened. JEGOS FIRE four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and tired.
 THREE PERFECTIONS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing half a mile from home, retreated through the latter portion of the far turn, went four wide
 into upper stretch, backed away and was eased through to the finish. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run and a Claim of foul by the trainer of
 MALIBU STRINGS alleging interference against THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN in the stretch. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result stood
 before the race was declared official.
