 Footnotes
 ALVEAR, pulling a bit against light restraint while shifting out three deep to track the leaders in second flight, continued to make steady progress while being
 fanned four wide on the far turn, advanced in that path to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and held sway to the
 end under firm handling. NUTTY FUTTY broke awkwardly losing some position at the start, was rated off the second flight for a half, gained position
 between foes on the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch then continued willingly inside the winner to close the gap late while no
 match. PENSADOR tracked the leaders along the rail in second flight to the far turn, saved ground to late stages while racing in close quarters but
 continued with an effort to improve position. ALPINE GATHERING, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace into the backstretch, dueled for command to
 upper stretch and gave way. SPANISH JAZZ settled last early and never gained contention. YOU FUNNY MAN tracked the leaders between foes in second
 flight, lodged a brief, three wide bid between rivals on the far turn and soon flattened out. UNBRIDLED TORCH, urged to the lead while angling to the rail,
 dueled inside rivals into the far turn and gave way.

 Footnotes
 SUN COUNTRY angled sharply to the rail shortly after the break, saved all the ground through the opening turn, traveled in the same path while gaining
 ground into the far turn, shifted four wide at the three sixteenths pole and finished with a game rally down the center of the lane. STORMY SAILOR pressed
 the pace in the two path through the opening half, took command past the half mile pole, led into the stretch and was caught in the final yards. BEST OF
 THE BLEU'S tracked three wide in the first flight early, continued to travel in the same path throughout, and was outkicked in the lane but held on for a
 share. ZERO tracked on the rail in the second flight and finished evenly in the lane. BENSON HILLBILLY was unhurried between foes through the first
 quarter, tracked behind rivals while saving ground through the far turn, angled out midstretch and finished belatedly. BLUES ORBIT pressed the pace four
 wide in the early going, continued to travel in that path throughout and weakened through the stretch. STAR SPANGLED broke well inside, set the pace
 through the half, collared by STORMY SAILOR prior to the three eighths pole and faded from there. JUSTCALLME CHARLIE was reserved four wide and
 failed to menace. L G SUPREM was reserved three wide throughout and proved no factor. SIZZLER was outrun throughout.

 Footnotes
 SHARPENER, in touch between foes in the first flight prompting the pace to the backstretch, went clear after a half to open a comfortable margin racing into
 upper stretch and just held the late charge of PINE GROVE ROAD in late stages under pressure. The latter ducked out at the start impeding a rival, was
 caught five wide racing into the first turn while dropping off the second flight, was prompted to advance five wide into the second bend, shifted inwards under
 pressure leaving midstretch but continued willingly. DANCING ZAPPER tracked the leaders three deep between foes in the second flight in the opening half,
 shifted out four wide racing into the far turn advancing to contention and continued with a mild bid. BYE BYE BENNIE tracked off the first flight between foes
 in the opening half and continued evenly into the stretch. SCHINDLERS RISK angled inwards in early stages to track between foes as part of the second
 flight, angled to the rail after a half, saved ground on the far turn, angled out entering upper stretch but had no rally. OH WHAT A DREAM sped to the fore
 along the rail in the opening stages, dueled for command inside to the backstretch and gave way nearing the lane. WILDCARD, urged to prompt the pace
 three wide into the backstretch, steadily faded entering the far turn. YA ANTABTTSY, reserved well off the field in the opening half, failed to menace.
 MEGAVOLT was a brief factor inside foes in the second flight but retreated early. MR. JERRY, carried out by PINE GROVE ROAD at the start, failed to
 menace thereafter.

 Footnotes
 ACADEMIC BAY settled off the second flight five wide racing through the backstretch, commenced a steady advance in that path entering the turn, moved
 to wrest command in late stages and drove clear. ADORKABLE angled inwards while prompted to make a steady gain between foes, three, then four wide
 between foes into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner while prevailing for the place honors. NOTORIOUS MISS, off a step behind the leaders, was
 urged to press the pace between foes through the backstretch, went clear racing into the turn but faltered leaving midstretch. VICTORY ICE settled between
 foes well off the second flight, angled to the inside racing into the lane and made a late effort to improve position. MORNING REPORT settled near the
 inside early and continued with a groundsaving trip to pass tiring rivals. FAIR LADY MISS tracked the pace between foes in second flight, was fanned five
 wide into upper stretch and steadily faded. FASHION TOUR broke slowly, angled to the inside early and failed to menace. BOOK THE BAND, urged to
 press the pace inside foes from the outset into the turn, gave way early. WHATSTHEBIGDEAL worked her way to the inside early tracking the leaders just
 off the second flight but offered no rally. FABULOUS DAHL, urged to press the pace three wide racing to the turn, gave way abruptly after three furlongs.

 SOUL OF DISCRETION was urged to the lead, took command shortly after the break, roused through the turn and extended his advantage through the
 stretch. POWER SONG tracked on the inside into the turn, saved ground throughout, and faltered in the final sixteenth but just held on for place. JOHN BOY
 BOOGIE was a bit slow into stride, swung out five wide on the turn, commenced a belated rally widest of all on the track and just missed place. LUCKY
 BENNY pressed the pace between foes and was done early. OH BROTHER JACK pressed the pace three wide moving into the turn and faded. JERSEY
 LUTE was roused early with several right-handed whips and dropped back on the inside, distanced and had no response. THERE WAS A WEATHER
 DELAY THAT WAS CHANGED TO A CANCELLATION OF THE LAST THREE RACES PRIOR TO THE SIXTH RACE.
