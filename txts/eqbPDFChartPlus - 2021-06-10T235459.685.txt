 Footnotes
 HEAVEN'S CREATION raced back off the early pace, began a steady advance just before a half, put a head in front upper stretch, lost the advantage a
 sixteenth out then mounted a late surge to prove best. MIZZ TUTU away in good order, set the pace inside, responded when challenged in the second turn,
 dueled to the wire, proved stubborn to the end to narrowly miss in a game effort. MISS GURETTA settled off the pace and the inside, moved out midway up
 the backstretch, continued in even fashion through the lane to prove no match for the top two. TAP CITY BABY closest to the runner up off the inside,
 weakened in the drive. KOOL AID GIRL last to leave, remained always back.

 Footnotes
 MCILHENNY broke alertly, fell back off the pace while off the inside, made a quick outside move to challenge in the second turn, dueled through upper
 stretch, edging away late while fully extended. FINEST KYLIE narrowly set the pace along the inside, dueled in the run up the backstretch, continued to vie
 while closest to the inside of the first flight into the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, clearly second best. NOTIMEFORCHITCHAT broke with the
 field, dueled outside the runner up, with the top two while between them into the lane, weakened, very comfortably saved the show. TICKETFORMICHELLE
 void of speed, came six wide into the stretch, improved slightly while never a serious threat. CARENCRO SPECIAL within striking distance outside and four
 wide in the first turn, continued to stalk the middle half, came up empty for the drive while steering out. DRENA'S BEST pulled early while a bit slow to settle
 in the first turn, saved some ground onto and up the backstretch, faded in the drive.

 SHARP HENNY broke alertly, raced within striking distance inside, two path mid turn, dropped back to the rail into the lane, shifted out a bit for room past
 the furlong marker, late bid, edging away late while kept to pressure. TIMEFORMETOFLY cleared to the inside late backstretch, narrowly showed the way
 through the turn, garnered a larger advantage approaching the furlong marker, briefly offered brief resistance to the winner past midstretch then could not
 keep pace the final sixteenth. CONSPICUOUS WOMAN pressured the pace in the three path, had little left for the drive, saved the show. FRENZY forwardly
 placed off the inside, moved closer while between rivals late in the turn, flattened out then weakened in the drive. ARKANSAS ALLEY void of speed,
 continued to trail throughout in showing little.

 ITSNOTMYJOB with the pace while racing in the two path, dueled turning for home, kicked strongly clear. ROSE CROWN behind the first flight while racing
 inside, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the place. SOUTHERN GALAXY broke alertly, fell back off the pace inside, angled out five
 wide turning for home carrying BREAUX BRIDGE BABY out and brushing with that one, could not get to the runner up late. FLASH LARUE moved up to
 show the way into the turn, dueled inside the winner late in the bend and into the stretch, began to tire when straightened for home and continued to fade
 the final furlong. BREAUX BRIDGE BABY last away, raced back and off the pace, brushed, carried out six wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally while
 remaining out in the middle of the strip.

 YES BABE broke alertly, vied up front three wide, shook clear turning for home, steadily drew out through the lane while being kept to pressure. JUST A
 BANDIT second flight inside, 3w into lane, steered out, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no serious threat to the winner. NOLA FASHION lacked
 early foot just off the inside, dropped to the rail late in the turn, moved back out to improve position and be along for the show. DREAMY ART in the second
 group while outside, raced four out to five wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. OLE BLACK MAGIC fell back to trail after the start, picked off a
 couple of tiring rivals late while never a threat. HUNKY DORY vied up front while between rivals for three furlongs, tired in the drive. BEADSINTHETREES
 flashed brief speed along the inside, stopped in the drive.

 CAJUN CHAOS behind the two leaders for three furlongs, moved out a bid for the drive, challenged nearing the furlong ground, put a head in front with just
 under an eighth left, powered clear under firm encouragement. SPARKY SPARKLES broke sharp, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the
 other speed into the stretch, briefly responded when the winner came alongside with a furlong remaining, could not keep pace late, remained comfortably
 clear for the runner up spot. SMOOTH COLLIERY broke a step slow, raced back, came five wide out of the turn, stage a minor rally to be along for the show
 while not a threat to the top two. GEAUXCRO away in good order, pressed then moved up to duel through the turn, weakened in the drive. CLASSIC
 GREELEY made little impact while saving ground throughout. D'ROCKETMAN bobbled at the start, moved up to a forward position while three wide, gave
 way in the drive.

 Footnotes
 CAPTAIN TYREE settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, set down briskly, good late courage to be just up. ALEX'S TURN
 never far back, advanced to challenge in the second turn, vied through the stretch, missed between rivals at the wire. SHEDROW COCKTAILS cleared to
 the inside before a quarter, dueled up the backstretch while remaining closest to the inside, narrowly showed the way into the lane, extended drive, proved
 game to the end to earn part of the place while also between horses at the end. THAT'S D 'CAT allowed to settle toward the inside, two path into the far
 turn, continued one paced through the lane along the rail in lacking a closing punch. MUSTANG EDDIE pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled in the
 run up the backstretch and into the far turn, had little left in weakening in the drive. BOSTON BOB last to leave, moved out, wide in the run up the
 backstretch, failed to threaten. TAP THAT WORD finished early, trailed home.

 IS TOO forwardly placed from the start inside, rail bid before a half, shook clear, maintained daylight while being kept to task through the stretch. MARIAH'S
 GALAXY broke well, fell back off the pace, patiently handled, continued to save ground into the lane, set down, little late gain on the winner, proved
 determined for the place. ROUSSALKA away in good order, raced prominent and outside, long drive for the place while also unable to much with the
 winner, outkicked for that position late. BERMUDA STAR off a step slow, raced back while checked up into the first turn in some traffic, moved out, 4w into
 lane, mild late interest. TAP DANCE STAR in mid pack early, fell back after a half, came five wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally while steadily angling
 in. MI COPA REBOSA broke sharp, set the pace after clearly toward the inside, appeared to try and lug in backstretch, gave way when headed.
