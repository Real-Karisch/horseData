 Footnotes
 PLEASANT BUFFY dropped to the inside just after the start, moved up to vie along the rail before a quarter, got clear onto the backstretch, rated the middle
 half then drew out through the lane while being kept to task. MISS DURLYN a bit slow to settle in the first turn when four wide, moved inside, advanced
 while saving ground in the second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. DEEZ JITTERBUG void of any early speed, raced
 off the inside, along for the show late while not a threat to the top two. PLAIN OLE HEART broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn in the two path,
 allowed the winner the inside through that first bend, chased that rival up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way. VIOLENCEREADY settled in mid
 pack early, had nothing for the drive. K P ANNA forwardly placed in the first turn, was finished before a half.

 Footnotes
 SCHUYLER SISTER broke alertly, cleared soon after, continued to maintain a daylight advantage into the lane, held sway in the late going. TIZMYDAY
 settled off the pace, saved ground, up late for the place while continuing along the inside. Z BONITA closest to the winner, chased that into and through
 upper stretch, no late gain, nipped in the final strides for the place. QUEEZEE PROUD went one paced throughout in lacking a late response. LAFITTE'S
 DIAMOND last to leave, never menaced while racing four wide through the turn and picking off a couple of tiring rivals through the stretch. CHOOSE THIS
 DANCE remained back and also was never a factor. UNVEIL steadily faded through the stretch.

 FLAT OUT LOVE last to leave, trailed early, strong move on the outside to reach the front turning for home, drove well clear. HALF OF TIP TAP within
 striking distance, between rivals exiting the bend, no match for the winner, held sway for the place. D'ROCK closest to the leader along the inside up the
 backstretch, lost some position while continuing inside turn, slipped through along the rail into the lane, finished up evenly. CHURCH OF ENGLAND
 sprinted clear soon after the start, showed the way through the turn, gave way when headed by the winner entering the stretch while in the two path.

 IZZY B WINN headed up the second flight between rivals, ranged up to challenge four wide turning for home, edged clear under pressure when
 straightened for home, gained a larger advantage a furlong out, held the runner up safe late under continued pressure late. ST. PETE'S CROWN lacked
 early foot, continued to race back while three wide exiting the turn, shifted out widest upper stretch, made a late run to finish up willingly down the middle of
 the strip. LONESOME PHIL last away, raced back in trailing early, circled five wide into contention turning for home, drifted in while flattening out, outkicked
 for the place. LOUISIANA WILDCAT lacked speed, improved through some traffic down the lane. JR'S SAUVAGE in mid pack inside, continued to save
 ground into the lane, lacked a closing punch. NATALIO dueled up front while off the inside, three wide into the stretch, faltered when headed. LITTLE HUT
 dueled up front closest to the inside, stopped after a half.

 INVASORS WIND bit fractious prestart, patiently handled while toward the inside, split rivals to challenge inside the furlong grounds, dug in late to prevail in
 game fashion. MY GOLDEN TALE stalked the pace in the three path outside the winner, advanced and challenged on the outside, outfinished in the final
 sixteenth. KID CORREA alternated up front while in hand and closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, clear past the
 furlong marker, could not contain the top two. D'DIGGER set or forced the pace while off the inside, gave way from between foes into the stretch.

 clear under pressure. LION HEART LEGEND in the second flight while off the inside, ranged up toward the front four wide and inside the winner turning into
 the stretch, could not match strides with the winner the final furlong, finished willingly to earn the place. FLYIN' ORPHAN settled in mid pack off the inside,
 angled out to be three wide turning for home, rallied for the show. VISION TO WIN IT away in good order, vied up front while closest to the inside of the top
 flight, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker then weakened. SPARKY TOP broke sharp, set or forced the pace while between rivals, gradually
 weakened through the stretch. FORUM FORM void of speed for a half, picked off a few tiring rivals while not a serious threat. KELCORCEE with the pace
 for a half while three wide gave way in the drive. MICK in mid pack for four furlongs, had nothing for the drive. BURNING IT UP staged a steady retreat.

 BLESSED SONG with the pace from the start off the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear into the stretch, responded when the runner up came
 alongside a furlong out, outfinished that one after a late duel in game fashion. OUR MILLIE broke out a bit, within striking distance early toward the inside,
 raced in the two path turn, moved out a bit and challenged outside the winner a furlong out, outkicked in the run to the wire. DALE'S LIL SIS in mid pack
 along the inside, raced in some traffic in the turn after coming off the rail, staged a mild rally in the drive to annex the show, not a serious threat to the top
 two. PRESLI'S ARGUMENT within striking distance early outside, lacked a closing bid. DESERT EMPRESS dueled up front inside the winner for three
 furlongs and began to weaken. WILD FOR CATHRINE hopped at the start and was in a bit tight, raced back off the pace and failed to threaten. OFF CYCLE
 pinched back at the start, raced back while saving ground, encountered some traffic midstretch, failed to threaten. DIAMOND THIEF was finished early.

 NORTH HULLEN broke out but toward the front, narrowly set the early pace off the inside, got clear in the turn, held the runner up comfortably safe through
 the stretch under steady handling. MY PROPHET off the early pace inside, moved closer while in some traffic along the rail late in the turn, moved out for
 room in the drive, could not get to the winner under spirited handling, clearly second best. YOUVE GOT A FRIEND settled off the pace, 2nd flight into the
 turn off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, up for the show while not a late threat to the top two. MY BUDDY CHUCK broke alertly, pressured the
 winner from the inside for a half, fell back in the turn while in some traffic, went evenly through the stretch to be outfinished for the show. BLUE FORTY
 TWO void of speed, came five wide out of the turn, lacked a closing response. MY EXPECTATIONS last to leave, never menaced. A BAND APART
 forwardly placed on the outside, moved closer late in the turn in the three path, failed to sustain that advance in the drive.
