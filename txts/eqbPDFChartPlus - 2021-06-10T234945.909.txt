 left handed urging in upper stretch, ducked out from the right handed crack of the whip past the eighth pole then turned back the bid of the runner-up under
 steady handling late. RUBY BRADLEY also broke out a bit, stalked inside then just off the rail into and on the turn and into the stretch, drifted out some from
 the whip in upper stretch, angled inward past midstretch to bid inside the winner then could not match that one late while clearly best of the others. INTO
 RISSA broke slowly, moved up inside to chase the pace, continued along the rail on the turn and in the stretch and was well clear for the show. VA VA
 VOOM had speed off the rail then stalked outside a rival, continued just off the fence into the stretch, drifted in late and weakened. MISS RICOCHET
 stalked outside a rival then dropped back a bit off the fence on the turn and had little left for the stretch. MORGAN'S HUMOR broke a bit slowly, chased

 slowly, chased outside a rival then three deep leaving the backstretch and on the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in some in midstretch
 and bid outside the top pair in deep stretch and also went on gamely to the end. KING OF SPEED broke out a bit, pulled between horses and stalked
 between rivals, fell back a bit between foes on the backstretch and second turn, came out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. BIG SCOTT DADDY
 had good early speed and angled in, set a pressured pace inside, fought back into the stretch, continued inside and weakened late. URBAN LIGHT (IRE)
 squeezed back some at the start, pulled outside foes then stalked three deep, continued alongside a rival leaving the backstretch and on the second turn,
 came three wide into the stretch, steadied in tight off heels between foes nearing midstretch and could not offer the necessary late kick. RIJEKA (IRE)
 stalked the pace inside, came out between horses into the stretch, also steadied some in tight off heels in midstretch and weakened late.

 Footnotes
 SQUARE PEGGY had good early speed off the rail then angled in, dueled inside, inched away on the turn, kicked clear under urging in the stretch and held
 on gamely. MOONSHINE ANNIE chased outside a rival then a bit off the rail, continued inside into and on the turn, came out into the stretch and closed
 willingly three deep on the line. SHYLOCK EDDIE stalked outside a rival then inside, steadied sharply off heels leaving the turn, came out in upper stretch
 and rallied gamely between foes late. SCATHING broke a bit slowly, settled off the rail then outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and
 finished with some interest. EMMY AND I had speed outside then angled in and dueled alongside the winner, stalked just off the rail on the turn and into
 stretch and weakened some late. SETTLE IT stalked between horses then outside a rival into and on the turn and could not summon the needed late kick.
 CHASIN LUCAS angled in and raced in a good position stalking the pace inside to the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. ENGLISH
 ROYALITY sent inside to chase the pace, was shuffled back some a half mile out, went outside a rival on the turn and three deep into the stretch and did
 not rally. EREBUNI angled in and pulled her way along inside, steadied into the turn, continued inside and was not a threat.
