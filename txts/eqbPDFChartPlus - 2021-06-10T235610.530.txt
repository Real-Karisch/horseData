 Footnotes
 UNLAWFUL ACT was always in good position, rallied three wide on the second turn, took the lead, edged away under urging to mid stretch and held
 driving. GRAN FIESTA was outsprinted, settled to the half, bid two wide on the second turn then closed steadily but too late. COOK UP A STORM tracked
 the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide while trying to rally to the stretch but finished evenly late. NICE ENOUGH set the pace from the two path
 to the second turn, was collared by the winner and weakened in the stretch. MI SCIMITAR had no speed and was not a threat. FOREST OYSTER ducked
 out sharply at the start, was corrected but bore out into the first turn, again was corrected but was not a factor. The race was hand timed.

 KELLY chased the leader to the turn, was three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front leaving mid stretch and prevailed. SPRING HEAT set the pace off the
 rail to the stretch, could not stall the winner leaving mid stretch but was second best. PRINCESS ASHLYN pressed the pace from the rail to the stretch then
 lacked a closing response. GOLIATH'S GIRL stalked the leader from between rivals and two wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. PRETTY
 SURPRISE had no speed and was not a factor.

 NEVER DOUBLE DIP was urged early but had no speed, got fanned four wide to the stretch but rallied when set down, caught ASSETS INCLUDED a
 sixteenth out and pushed clear. ASSETS INCLUDED contested the pace two wide to the stretch, pushed away from JET PAK BLACK and was clear to mid
 stretch but could not hold the winner still better than the others. CUT chased the pace to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid
 stretch and finished evenly. SOUTHERN LIBERTY was chasing the leaders to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. THE
 REAL MCCANN had no speed and was never a threat. POWER OF FOURTEEN also had no speed, was three wide on the turn and did not rally. JET PAK
 BLACK hustled along and dueled inside the runnerup to the middle of the turn, got outkicked to the stretch and gave way.

 BOUNTIFUL DESERT pressed the pace early, shifted off the rail leaving the five eighths, rallied three wide on the second turn, got to terms into the stretch,
 battled determinedly and prevailed. BARTON LODGE (IRE) settled mid pack to the half, bid three wide to the stretch, dueled through the final furlong but
 was bested. GABO'S MACONDO trailed to the second turn, circled five wide to the stretch then closed determinedly late. AIR NASHOBA was on the pace
 to the second turn, responded two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. CALL SAUL was four wide, settled to the second turn,
 remained four wide to the stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. PASS DUE PAYMENT was settled to the second turn, circled four wide to the
 stretch but lacked a closing response. CRYSTAL DOME (GB) chased the pace two wide but came up empty in the drive. MY LAST SHOT hustled along and
