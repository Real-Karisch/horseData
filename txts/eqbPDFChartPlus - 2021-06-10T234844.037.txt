 Footnotes
 CODRINGTON rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, came under urging at the three-eighths, chased three wide on the far turn,
 made a bid nearing the furlong marker, moved out behind PURELY LUCKY outside the sixteenth-pole, passed that foe as she waited on rivals and lost
 focus then prevailed under strong urging. PURELY LUCKY was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, bobbled some outside the five-eighths,
 was reserved towards the back, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, rallied four wide into upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead
 coming to the furlong marker, threw her ears up and completely lost focus while waiting on opponents after getting to the front, relinquished the lead in the
 vicinity of the sixteenth-pole, pinned her ears and leveled out again the last couple of strides but missed and snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. BIG
 EXPENSE was asked to establish position leaving the gate, raced inside on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn,
 was asked at the quarter-pole then moved into the two path, steadied while blocked behind horses at the furlong marker, found some room and made a bid
 between foes at the sixteenth-pole, lugged in from that point to the wire and missed while clear for the show. NORTHERNSTREETGAL was taken in hand
 while showing early speed, stalked the pace on the outside under a snug hold in the two path, was let out on the far turn then roused coming to the
 quarter-pole, passed the three-sixteenths on even terms for the lead, drifted in passing the furlong marker, was in tight while weakening some at the
 sixteenth-pole then gave way. SILVERADO MIST pulled while going to the front, set the pace on the inside under a snug hold, was asked at the
 quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. REYANA REYA DELITE broke out at the start, lugged out a
 bit into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, angled in early on the backstretch, moved closer along the hedge with a half-mile to run, was urged along
 while inside on the far turn, spun into the two path entering the stretch, came under the whip near the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response.
 MISTY FOREST was a bit recalcitrant while loading then also in the gate, tucked into the two path on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, came
 under encouragement in the four path on the far turn and failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 BUILD TO SUIT bobbled slighlty in the shadow of the starting gate, was lightly hand encouraged on the chute securing its positon, sat in the two path, within
 range of a disputed pace, got asked for more proceeding to shift course to the outside at the end of the bend, was driven into the six path during the
 opening half of the stretch run, straightened away and took off in earnest after the front runners, wore down those fighting foes with approximately a
 sixteenth to go then kicked clear in the final seventy yards, crossing the wire under a hard drive. SAMADI SKY showed no ill effects after bobbling at the
 start, departed the backstretch from the three path, crept up to make its presence felt after the half had been completed, vied as the widest of three for the
 top beginning from the five-sixteenths pole, got set down for the drive home, forged to a narrow lead by midstretch, clung desperately to it for the next
 sixteenth before having it snatched away by the winner, fought with vigour thereafter to earn the place award. EYE LUV LULU grabbed the advantage
 shortly after the start, got set up along the rail, went at it one on one early with RUNAWAY LUTE, saw the second place fnisher transform that contest into a
 three-way one past the midway point on the turn, got turned loose into the lane, relinquished deep into the furlong grounds, fought well to the wire, winning
 out over RUNAWAY LUTE for third. RUNAWAY LUTE pressed the issue from the two path, undertook the task from between rivals from the five-sixteenths
 pole to the final stages, held on well for the last major check. SO NOTED reserved in the two path, got fanned out seven wide from upper to midstretch,
 lacked a winning response. NOBODY MOVE sat in the two path in pursuit of those involved in the pace squabble, came up empty for the stretch drive.
 BEYOND THE GREEN quickly guided over to the inside, failed to respond appreciably when heavily roused at the five-sixteenths marker. CHILLY BON
 BON stumbled badly after being spurng by the starter, travelled four wide on the turn and gave way. TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK three wide onto the turn,
 exiting it by swinging five wide, was through after a half.

 Footnotes
 SUNSET RIDGE stumbled at the start getting away last, was forwardly placed along the inside through the first turn before being cleared outside by
 SOMEKINDASEXY and taking to the three path six and a half furlongs from home, attended the leader keeping a watchful eye on BONITA BIANCA to the
 outside, advanced to take command when ready half a mile from home and was pressed through the turn by BONITA BIANCA to her outside while three
 wide and under coaxing from the three-eighths shaking away as a pair, floated out four wide into upper stretch shaking off her main threat, drew clear under
 a drive through the stretch getting geared down inside the sixteenth marker, the outcome in no doubt. BONITA BIANCA broke in at the start making light
 contact with SOMEKINDASEXY, raced three wide in aim of the leader through the opening bend before tracking the top pair five then four wide down the
 backstretch, came under light coaxing near the half mile pole as the aforementioned foe attempted to slip away, pressed that rival from the outside in the
 four path through the far turn under urging from the three-eighths, got shaken off a bit nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide at that station, chased the
 winner home well clear of the rest and second best. SOMEKINDASEXY bumped lightly at the start by BONITA BIANCA who broke inwards, established the
 front into the first turn and showed the way from the two path, remained patiently handled as SUNSET RIDGE ranged up outside with six furlongs to go and
 was given some rein to maintain her slim advantage, got headed at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the half mile pole shaken off by the top pair,
 chased just off the inside through the turn isolated between a pair of rivals out front and a pair behind, continued just off the inside for home and tired in the
 stretch while along clear for the show honors. DANIELLE'S PRIDE stumbled at the start, chased three wide through the first turn, then raced three then two
 wide down the backstretch detached from the top trio in tandem with FIVE EACH WAY at the rear, came under coaxing half a mile from home, swung five
 wide into upper stretch and made no impact. FIVE EACH WAY a bit rank and generally unsettled just off the inside through the first turn, settled three to four
 wide down the backstretch detached from the top trio along with the aforementioned rival at the rear, came under coaxing half a mile from home, went four
 wide into upper stretch and was outrun.

 Footnotes
 BATTLE STATION swerved out at the start but broke in front as the field left the gate in two flights, set the pace through solid fractions, dictated terms while
 inside on the turn, extended the advantage against the hedge into the stretch, was put to a right-handed whip at the three-sixteenths and held under strong
 urging. BARBAROSSA was taken in hand while showing early speed, settled in fourth position, rounded the turn in the two path, shifted four wide at the
 quarter-pole, came under the whip while outside in upper stretch, chased the winner in the final furlong and finished with good courage while gaining on that
 foe late but missed. THROW THE DEUCE broke a step slow, settled well off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, angled out sharply while still
 on his inside lead in upper stretch, leveled out then accelerated after switching to the proper lead at the furlong marker and finished with good energy to get
 the show. SANDLOT STAR was hustled from the start, showed speed then chased the pace, raced inside on the turn, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole,
 pursued the winner under a drive in upper stretch, lugged inward in the final furlong and was out-kicked then lost the show. IRON JOHNNY broke a half-step
 slow but at the front of the second flight, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, reached a good striking
 position under the whip into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick thereafter. MR. HOT ROCKS showed speed on the outside then chased the pace,
 went around the turn in the two path, was taken up behind the winner coming to the quarter-pole, pursued that foe into upper stretch, was in tight briefly
 while dropping back at the furlong marker then weakened. JUST BUSTIN settled on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went two to three
 wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally. CHASINDAMONEY broke a step slow, raced well back in the field, traveled around the turn
 in the two path and showed little. BADABOOM stumbled after the start then dropped back while trying to recover, was reserved near the back while a bit
 green, dropped to the rail early on the turn and was no factor. POTOMAC TWO STEP broke a bit awkwardly and a step slow, was urged along towards the
 rear on the outside, went three wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and was outrun.

 Footnotes
 AVEENU MALCAINU away without apparent mishap, took up the chase from the three path, got switched over to a drive a couple of jumps prior to spinning
 into the stretch, shifted slighter wider and then issued a stern bid upon reaching the furlong grounds, put away WHAT A CATCH after an abbreviated
 skirmish then shook free, kept to to the task at hand. INALIENABLE RIGHTS scraped the left side of the starting gate after lunging with his initial step, raced
 from well off the inside throughout, travelled four wide on the turn, made it off the turn and was asked for more, steadily moved out into path seven down the
 stretch, gaining ground nevertheless, wore down WHAT A CATCH with three jumps to spare before the finish line to be along for the place. WHAT A
 CATCH prompted the pacesetter to that opponent's outside, going about in the three path after the nemesis got out two wide during the early stages of the
 run around the bend, was narrowly in front when put to encouragement in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, got out-dueled by the winner soon
 afterwards, then lost the fight for the place in deep stretch to INALIENABLE RIGHTS. ANALYZE THE ODDS took the inside route, had the rider go to work
 past the five-sixteenths marker, was maneuvered out into path five from upper to midstretch, rallied midlly without posing a threat. MR. PETE rode the rail,
 was under some urging making his way on the turn, angled three wide at the three-sixteenths pole and came up empty. MORNING BREEZ was sharply
 angled over towards the inside down the backstretch, was proceeding along the inside approaching the half mile pole, got out into the two path almost
 immediately after stepping onto the top of the turn, kept from going much wider only due to the herculean grip being applied by the pilot on the left side,
 spun into the stretch still engaged with WHAT A CATCH, went back to a truer course after some solid right handed stick work at the head of the stretch,
 yielded for good but remained prominently placed for a little while longer then gave way. ALIEN INVASION two wide entering the turn, got fanned six wide
 exiting it, had no rally. SMOKIN PLATINUM had the rider take hold after lunging inward with his first step, reached out in a green manner racing on the
 backstretch, departed the half mile pole in the three path and failed to reach a contending position.

 HOPE'S ROAR grew rank under restraint off the heels of TERRALSOLE while three wide into the first turn as that rival crossed directly in front, remained
 three wide through the opening bend and settled just off the pace down the backstretch, avoided the traffic jam into the far turn and came under coaxing at
 the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied, getting bumped by HAVANA AFFAIR inside the eighth pole as that rival came out
 under a near sided stick, knocked heads with that foe overtaking the leader as a team a sixteenth out and prevailed gamely to get the bob in the last jump to
 the wire. HAVANA AFFAIR three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths advancing to take slim command spinning four wide
 into upper stretch, got headed straightened away and came out under a near sided stick bumping the aforementioned foe and taking the worst of it getting
 knocked askew inside the eighth pole as they hooked up head to head, overthrew the leader a sixteenth out battling to the finish but was ultimately bested
 by a nod at the end. COREY Q four then three wide early on near the rear, commenced a steady advance from the five-eighths, tucked inside to avoid the
 traffic nearing the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, swung two to three wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure
 the show honors. WISH UPON three wide in pursuit from mid pack, altered out sharply to the five path just inside the half mile pole as NEW CANAAN and
 HARDLY MATE checked in tight inside when GRANDPA'S ARIANNA tucked inside directly in front, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled
 out eight wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to rally and secure the last major share. GRANDPA'S ARIANNA tracked the pace in range just
 off the inside, tucked inside sharply near the half mile pole forcing NEW CANAAN and HARDLY MATE to check sharply inside that station and in turn forced
 a trio of rivals to alter course in behind them, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch rallying to take
 command a furlong out, dug in under a drive and was overtaken a sixteenth from home and weakened in the late stages. JACQUELINE D showed the way
 in hand from the two path, came under coaxing under challenge three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch briefly headed for command
 before taking back the front straightened away, got displaced nearing the eighth pole for good and weakened in the late going. HARDLY MATE just off the
 inside near the rear, tucked to the hedge and advanced inside to be just off the pace when forced to check sharply half a mile from home as GRANDPA'S
 ARIANNA tucked directly in front which in turn forced NEW CANAAN to check sharply in behind and a trio consisting of TIFFANY'S VISION, WISH UPON
 and KATS GIRL CALA to scatter in behind and alter outwards, lost about three to four lengths in position altogether, came under coaxing three furlongs from
 home, swung five wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. NEW CANAAN lunged at the start, chased just off the inside in mid pack, tucked inside
 nearing the half mile pole and was forced to check sharply as the aforementioned foe did likewise in front as GRANDPA'S ARIANNA tucked directly in front
 at that station and in turn sent a trio altering out to avoid trouble, lost three to four wide lengths in ground and position, came under light coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, went five wide for home and was under a light drive while never fully extended in the stretch. TERRALSOLE three wide through the first turn,
 raced four wide in range of the leader, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive.
 FRECKLE DE FRECK stacked out four wide through the opening turn, raced five then four wide down the backstretch and into the far turn coming under
 coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide for home and tired. TIFFANY'S VISION three then two wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide,
 had to alter out five to six wide inside the half mile pole as two rivals in front checked sharply, came under light coaxing briefly afterwards, spun just off the
 inside for home and made no impact. KATS GIRL CALA broke in at the start and was corrected, raced four then three wide through the first turn before
 chasing five wide down the backstretch, had a pair of rivals check sharply in front nearing the half mile pole and as a pair altered out in front to avoid that
 was forced to scatter and go seven to eight wide inside that station, remained overland through the turn before spinning six wide for home and was
 understandably unable to make an impact.

 Footnotes
 BAR OF GOLD bumped with a rival at the start, was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the far turn, was asked once
 straightened for the drive, rallied through a clear hedge opening when FREUDIE ANNE left the inside at the three-sixteenths, made a bid at the furlong
 marker, accelerated clear at the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging in an excellent trip. FOURSTAR CROOK moved in approaching the first
 turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was unhurried towards the back, came under urging while two then three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into
 the stretch, rallied outside under the whip and finished with good energy but was unable to reach the perfect trip winner. FLIPCUP bumped with a foe at the
 start, went around the first turn in the two path, was forwardly placed on the outside, raced in the two path on the far turn, was given her cue near the
 five-sixteenths, made a bid under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, battled until near the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished but just held the show. ACK
 NAUGHTY saved ground at the rear of the field, was roused in the two path into the stretch, opted not to follow the winner through along the hedge coming
 to the furlong marker, waited while blocked from that point until just inside the sixteenth-pole, altered course to the outside several paths just before a hole
 opened in front of her at that point and finished willingly but lost any chance. FREUDIE ANNE was reluctant to load, crossed over while going to the front,
 set the clear pace on the inside while under a hold, was asked at the top of the stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then weakened. FEELING
 BOSSY raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled in the middle of the field, moved closer while two then three wide on the far turn, was roused
 coming to the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong then tired. JET MAJESTY was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn,
 was reserved on the outside, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked while swinging five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

 Footnotes
 CAUSE WE ARE LOYAL sat within range of the front runners from the two path for the opening half and a bit more, got put to a drive angling out into path
 four, making it there by the eighth pole, came out a couple of paths after some left handed shots during the going from that station to the sixteenth pole,
 staved off the second place finisher's comeback and trudged home across the wire. NEWPORT BREEZE came away forwardly placed, vied for command to
 the outside of PAUSEFORTHECAUSE for a good portion of the trip along the backstretch, was two wide and between rivals stepping onto the bend, slid
 over to the rail at the seven-sixteenths pole, began to fall back, fell back even more readily from midpoint, galloping greenly to the quarter pole, all in all
 losing a much more substantial amount of ground between calls than otherwise indicated, cut the corner under light hand encouragement, picked up interest
 during the ensuing furlong, was put to stronger handling in midstretch and continued to make headway, tipped to be outside the former pacesetter in deep
 stretch, kept going with her comeback and fell short. MISS MYSTIQUE left the post parade early, proceeded to stumble at the start, cut over to the rail on
 the backstretch, was asked to pick it up and sped to the outside midway on the turn, with NEWPORT BREEZE herself in the process of dropping back in a
 hurry, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch and rallied for the show. PAUSEFORTHECAUSE vied for the lead from the inside, stepped off the
 backstretch still in front, staved off TROUBLE FOR SKYLAR during the run around the bend, moved into path two when set down, with the aforementioned
 rival taking her best shot at this juncture, was overhauled by the top one with under a furlong remaining, then backed away into the final on-the-board slot.
 TUDOX LIFTING OFF in the two path at the top of the turn, ventured out nine wide down the stretch without making any impact. ONE LAST CAST along the
 inside after the break, vacated the premises after MISS MYSTIQUE got set up there, was pulling on the bit for a good portion of the going on the
 backstretch, was strung out three to four wide on the turn, got maneuvered out into path seven during the stretch run, had no rally. TROUBLE FOR SKYLAR
 contended for the lead outside the leader on the turn, got roused spinning three wide into the lane, failed to claim the top during the next furlong and tired.
 BEAUX ARTS stumbled badly as the field was sent on its way, travelled two to three wide on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, had no offering and
 gave way. I STILL MISS YOU chased the front runners from the two path being ridden on the turn, had little left by the three-sixteenths pole and retreated.

 GET JETS saved ground near the rear of the strung out field in the early going, remained patiently handled until coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths
 to go, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied with a good kick to issue a challenge through the final eighth overhauling the leader in tandem with the
 runner up just inside the final sixteenth and prevailed kept to task and safe at the finish repelling that rival to the wire. OFFERING PLAN crossed to the
 inside shortly after the start and saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing shifted to the two path three furlongs from home, angled out five
 wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy to threaten through the final sixteenth overtaking the leader inside the sixteenth pole in concert with the
 aforementioned foe but was ultimately staved off by that rival to the finish. KHARAFA brushed the off side stall at the start and had his lane shut as ALL IS
 NUMBER took it over after being bumped into it by CHANGEWILLDOYAGOOD, raced three wide in the clear and near the rear, came under a ride with
 five-sixteenths to go, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied willingly to secure the show honors. BLACK TIDE spurted on the pace in hand along
 the inside, came under growing challenge once into the far turn from CHANGEWILLDOYAGOOD and was put to coaxing when headed by that rival
 five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch taking back command, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, came under threat
 from a host of challengers and was overwhelmed a sixteenth out, ran on to secure the last major share. ALL IS NUMBER bumped at the start by
 CHANGEWILLDOYAGOOD, settled just off the inside in mid pack, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper
 stretch, dug in under a drive running on through the stretch but was outfinished in the late stages. KING KREESA tossed his head at the start getting away
 half a beat slow, tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, spun two to three wide into upper stretch in behind
 foes, shifted in a path and lacked optimal clearance, darted to the inside nearing the eighth pole forcing the backing away MACAGONE to briefly steady and
 found himself stymied in traffic in behind BLACK TIDE from that point through to nearing the wire while lightly coaxed along. CHANGEWILLDOYAGOOD
 broke in at the start bumping ALL IS NUMBER into the path of KHARAFA, raced inside of BLACK TIDE early on before conceding the front to that foe and
 taking to the outside to race three wide through the first turn, raced three then two wide in closest aim of that rival while clear of the third rival in behind,
 advanced to issue a challenge through the far turn taking command under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide a the quarter pole
 straightened away for home displaced on the front, then weakened in the late stages. MACAGONE tracked the pace along the inside coming under
 encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner in behind BLACK TIDE into upper stretch, was forced to steady briefly as KING KREESA darted in
 front just inside the eighth pole when weakening and backed away through to the finish.

 Footnotes
 TWISTED TOM was rated in the two path on the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was roused outside the half-mile pole, chased in the four path
 under a right-handed whip on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. CAN YOU
 DIGGIT dropped back early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was asked leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide early on the far
 turn, moved to the four path while in striking range at the five-sixteenths, was put to the whip in upper stretch and secured the place while no match for the
 winner. PAT ON THE BACK bobbled slightly at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, made a
 bid between horses outside the five-sixteenths, came under the whip in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened while well clear for
 the show. BROKEN ENGAGEMENT was reluctant to load, rounded the first turn in the two path, followed the solo leader down the backstretch, chased in
 the two path on the far turn, made a bid between horses outside the five-sixteenths, battled under a drive in upper stretch and tired. D'YER MAK'ER bumped
 soundly with a rival at the start, went to the front, set the clear pace on the inside, was asked when challenged inside the three-eighths pole, lost the
 advantage at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch then moved out under a drive and capitulated. DYNAMAX PRIME bumped soundly with an
 opponent at the start, saved ground on the first turn, was urged along on the backstretch, dropped back while inside on the far turn and failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 MR. CAT as far off the inside as the four path proceeding along the backstretch, was worked over to the insie route in time for the run around the bend,
 contended with FOR POPS to the outside, was let out turning for home, drifted out down the lane yet managed to narrowly stave off the second place
 finisher. TIZ WICKED made it over to the hedge in short order, sat rated biding time, found a sliver of space and knifed its way into it in preparation for the
 drive home, this occurring a short distance past the five-sixteenths pole, got set down heading for upper stretch, shifted out into path six to secure optimnal
 racing clearance, rallied well, but missed. FROST PROOF took up the chase from the three path, ventured all the way out into path eight down the stretch,
 yet still finished well enough to secure the show. DAB angled inward, making contact several times before corrected, sat in midpack from the two path,
 moved wider and wider down the lane until seven wide late, rallied mildly. ENCHANTED FOREST squeezed at the break, raced towards the inside to end of
 the bend, was driven angling five wide from upper to midstretch, closed in but had to settle for a minor slice. ATWITZEND bumped in the shadow of the
 starting gate, tracked the pace dispute from the pocket, was under a drive prior to the quarter pole, weakened in the last eighth. FOR POPS sparred two
 wide with the winner to midstretch before giving way. SILKY WAY near the inside in pursuit of the front runners, cut the corner into the lane and had no
 response. DANNY'S RUSH four wide at the top of the turn, began the last eighth about six wide, was never invovled. GIROLIRA two wide and between
 opponents on the turn, was ridden in the three path for entrance into the stretch, gave way. LEATHERHEAD LURIE devoid of speed on the backstretch,
 saved ground to no avail. LOUISIANA LADY three wide stepping onto the turn, swung six wide exiting it, tired.
