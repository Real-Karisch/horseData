 Footnotes
 BETHYL'S ROYALROSE showed good speed, set the pace under some pressure, inched away while inside on the turn, was challenged at the quarter-pole,
 dueled with the runner-up in the stretch and prevailed under strong urging. HANNAH BO BABY chased the pace on the outside, went four then three wide
 on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, dueled with the winner in the stretch and missed while clear for the place. MISS HUR was ridden along off the
 pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. BOURBON BEST was ridden
 along at the rear, went four wide on the turn and failed to rally. FINAL SONG was ridden along towards the back, went two to three wide on the turn and was
 no factor. BETTER BELLE pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, chased two then three wide on the turn, floated four wide into the stretch and tired.

 coming to the quarter-pole, extended the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, swapped leads back and forth in the final furlong, drifted out late and
 proved much the best under strong urging. MOOJAB ROYAL lunged a bit at the start, saved ground while under restraint on the first turn, was well placed
 just off the pace, came under urging while inside on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner but finished
 with good courage to get the place. KELLY BELLY KID rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile
 pole, traveled around the far turn in the two path, turned into the stretch in the three path while under the whip and narrowly missed the place.
 CINNAMONSBIRDIE went three to four wide on the first turn, was well spotted just off the pace, chased four wide on the far turn and tired. ANOTHER
 GREY was caught five to six wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, passed the half-mile pole under urging, went five wide early on the far turn,
 dropped to the three path nearing the five-sixteenths, moved to the two path into the stretch and failed to rally. CHAMAY went two to three wide on the first
 turn, disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn, dropped back at the quarter-pole, shifted five wide into the stretch and
 capitulated. MAGIC GATO went four to five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, raced six then five wide
 on the far turn, dropped to the three path turning into the stretch and failed to respond. GIT ON LEE went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear,

 Footnotes
 BETA BABY went three wide on the first turn, made a strong middle move, advanced through the field to make a bid with three furlongs to run, vied in the
 three path on the far turn, was set down in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. FLYING MAGIC SONG broke about three
 lengths slow, went four wide for most of the first turn then dropped to the two path, settled at the rear, rounded the far turn in the three path, was put to the
 whip in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss. MULA DAWN saved ground on the first turn, was well placed just off the
 pace, chased two to three wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, made an outside bid into the final furlong and just missed while able to
 get the show. TX CONFEDERATEROSE went four then three wide on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside, moved clear with a half-mile to run,
 was challenged in the two path on the far turn, came under the whip in upper stretch, kept on in the final furlong, remained in contention under the whip into
 the final sixteenth and just missed the trifecta while under only a mild hand ride from the rider in the last seventy yards. MISS PHOTO raced in the two path
 for most of the first turn then dropped to the rail, contested the pace on the inside of TX CONFEDERATEROSE, dropped back at the half-mile pole, was
 urged along while inside on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out while chasing the vanguard and finished willingly but just missed
 the superfecta. EATONS OPPORTUNITY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was hard ridden while three to four wide on the far turn,

 Footnotes
 CAROLINE THE GREAT showed good speed, set the pace under pressure, inched clear on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, extended the
 advantage into the final furlong, raced under the whip into the final sixteenth then held under a brisk hand ride to the wire. TE FITI was reluctant to load,
 chased the pace, raced inside on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, moved out at the furlong marker then had the rider lose his whip and finished with
 good energy but was too late while clear for the place. FANCY FOX was ridden along on the outside, traveled around the early part of the turn in the two
 path, moved to the three then four path late on that bend, was put to the whip at the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show.
 SPACE COWGIRL pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, chased in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. SILVER
 EARS chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. JUSTA RED PHILLY chased the pace on the outside,
 dropped back at the seven-sixteenths, went four wide for most of the turn, dropped to the two path near the quarter-pole and came up empty. PRESCIENCE
 GROVE was last away, raced at the rear while ridden along, saved ground on the turn and was no factor.
