 Footnotes
 B L'S WAGON hustled up to rate the pace inside, rounded both rails on the turn, increased her lead through the far turn, then drove down the lane under
 moderate handling and was much the best. BOMBITA, saving ground into the first turn, settled off the pace inside, eased out and bid near the
 five-sixteenths pole and took the turn in the four path, then dug in gamely but was outfinished. EVERYTHINGISAWESUM settled well off the pace on the
 outside, made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the three path, then gained down the stretch and finished evenly. BORN TO BE MILD
 stalked the pace on the outside, began dropping back near the three-eighths pole, made a mild bid leaving the quarter pole off the rail, then faded in the
 stretch. FAIR PRAISE was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 DECIDING FACTOR was rushed up while angling in to set a pressured pace, widened the advantage through the turn and held well under steady stretch
 handling. CHARITABLE ANGEL chased the pace from the four path, rounded the turn at the rail and dueled through the stretch for second. LIVE FREE
 gave chase in the three path and was outfinished in the duel for second. GORGEOUS ROAD came away a step slow and was shuffled back on the chute,
 forced to the outside leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled in approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail rounding the turn and finished evenly. SING
 IN THE SPRING gave chase from the three path but showed little further down the lane. SWEET MS. LYNN bore out leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
 rounded the turn about the seven path and was not a factor. LOVIN' LIME gave chase from the outside and never factored. B F F ABBEY chased the pace
 toward mid track, rounded the turn in the six path then weakened.

 three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the far turn and held well under steady stretch handling. CHARITABLE BOUND raced in the
 three path the opening turn, eased out entering the backstretch, bid approaching the far turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn and was along for second in later
 yards. BRENDA J exchanged contact with Girlwthewrngtattoo leaving the gate, stalked that one off the rail, challenged nearing the three eighths pole,
 contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. SAILING ROCK saved ground off the pace, bid nearing
 the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly. BRASS MAGNOLIA, off the pace in the three path, settled outside entering the
 backstretch but showed little response past the three eighths pole.

 Footnotes
 CHARITABLE ELLIE, saving ground into the first turn, settled well off the pace on the inside, made a bid near the quarter pole in the three path and eased
 out to the seven path through the far turn, then drove down the stretch under steady handling to come up near the sixteenth pole, and widened to the wire.
 SEEKING SERA settled off the pace inside and made a bid past the five-sixteenths pole, rounded the turn on the rail and eased out to the five path leaving
 the turn and dug in gamely but was unable to close. SHREWD PURCHASE hustled up and angled in to rate an early pressured pace inside, was caught
 approaching the half pole and made a bid at the three-eighths, then rounded the far turn in the three path and angled out at the sixteenth pole to finish
 evenly. RUMERS ARE TRUE pressured the pace outside and took over approaching the half pole, drew clear past the seven-sixteenths and angled in to
 the rail, rounded the far turn on the rail, then dug in down the lane but was caught near the sixteenth pole and faded. CLEARBROOK MISS settled well off
 the pace on the outside then angled to the rail mid-turn, moved sharply to the outside past the eight pole and showed little further. HOLY CHROME saved
 ground into the first turn and settled off the pace inside, eased out into the backstretch and made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole, improved between
 horses through the turn in the four path, then steadied from between horses in the upper stretch and came out a path or two, but flattened out. BLUE RIDGE
 MIST was never a factor. WINDSOR'S SUNSHINE was bumped at the gate by Just a Lil Runaway then raced outside but was through after a half. JUST A
 LIL RUNAWAY broke out and bumped Windsor's Sunshine at the start, then raced well back and was never a factor. TOY TRAIN raced outside and was
 through after a half.

 Footnotes
 JUST BY CHANCE steadied off the heels of Chico Grande and angled four wide into the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead inside
 the eighth pole, drew clear mid-stretch and dug in under steady encouragement to keep that one at bay. CHICO GRANDE, off the pace in the two and three
 paths, bid nearing the three eights pole, steadied at the rail off the heels of Triple Black Jack leaving the far turn, came inside that one past the eighth pole
 and dueled for second while outfinished for the win. GENTLEMEN DALE angled in nearing the first turn then saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the
 three eighths pole, angled to the five path rounding the far turn, was along for third in the final yards but was unsaddled on the clubhouse turn and vanned
 off in distress. TRIPLE BLACK JACK tapered in leaving the three quarter pole and rated the pace two deep from the five eighths pole, drew clear and
 moved inside past the half mile pole, was met at even terms nearing the three eighths, fought back for control toward the five sixteenths, maintained the
 advantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn but was caught leaving the eighth pole and weakened the final sixteenth. BARKEEPER steadied at the
 heels of Gentlemen Dale into the first turn then settled well back off the rail through the turn, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
 the far turn in the three path and showed little further. CURVES THAT KICK had a brief lead through the front stretch then stalked the pace inside leaving
 the five eighths pole, dueled to even terms nearing the three eighths, continued a close factor two deep rounding the far turn then weakened in the stretch.
 MONGOLIAN CHROME steadied at the heels of Barkeeper into the first turn, angled out through the turn, settled outside into the backstretch and never
 factored. CONTRACTOR JAK, off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, faded readily leaving the three eighths pole and was eased. The
 stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Gentlemen Dale, lodged by the rider of Barkeeper, and disqualified the former for coming across the
 path of the latter into the first turn.

 KATMAN QUICK stalked the pace off the rail, challenged past the three eighths pole, took the lead leaving the five sixteenths, contested the edge two deep
 rounding the far turn, drifted a bit entering the stretch, dueled clear a sixteenth away and held on well. BIG BAD DUDE, off the pace in the three path the
 opening turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn, eased outward approaching the top of the lane,
 finished well and was gaining widest. PRIMARY ACCOUNT rated the pace inside, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, headed at the five
 sixteenths, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn but dropped back mid-stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. I
 NEED YOU became a bit edgy in the gate then hopped at the break, rounded the first turn in the four and five paths, settled outside into the backstretch, bid
 nearing the three eighths pole, improved in the five path of the far turn but showed little further in the stretch. STREET PARADE raced off the pace in the
 three and four paths the opening turn and settled outside into the backstretch, showed little response and rounded the far turn in the six path. KOKO KEY
 saved ground to no avail. ZOIEE'S DREAM checked at the heels of Primary Account while boxed at the inside flank of Katman Quick into the first turn,
 raced just off the pace through the turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail rounding the far turn.
