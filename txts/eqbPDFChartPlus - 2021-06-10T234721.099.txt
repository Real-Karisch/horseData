 JO MARIE bore out at the start, pressed the pace in the two path and was clear in the stretch under steady urging. CAIRO CUTIE led between foes, came
 in near the fifteen-sixteenths pole to tighten up a foe, led inside, then was no match in the drive. RODHWAAN was impeded at the start, trailed inside, then
 gained the show spot late. READY ORB NOT hopped at the start, raced inside, shifted to the three path at the three-eighths pole, then had no bid. BESS
 stalked the pace in the three path, then faded in the stretch. SKY FREAK was checked at the fifteen-sixteenths pole, pressed the pace in side, then gave
 way on the far turn. GIANT BLOSSOM was not a factor.
