 X S GOLD sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inside, came a bit off the rail into the stretch and won clear under urging and steady handling late.
 FUNNY BEAN pulled her way along to chase the pace a bit off the rail, tugged between foes in tight into the second turn, went outside a rival on that turn
 and three deep into the stretch and gained the place. SUPER PATRIOT stalked outside a rival then off the rail, went between horses on the second turn and
 three wide into the stretch and bested the others. MO SEE CAL broke slowly then tossed her head, chased off the rail then three deep on the backstretch
 and four wide on the second turn and into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. TISN'T SHE LUCKY also away slowly, angled in and settled off the rail,
 came out into the stretch and did not rally. MY CLAW angled in and tugged her way along early, saved ground stalking the pace, continued inside on the
 second turn and in the stretch and weakened. LUCKY AT THE BAY unhurried just off the rail early and on the backstretch and second turn, lacked a
 response in the stretch. STAR OF KOBOL stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail, was between horses into the stretch and weakened.

 STREAK OF LUCK saved ground stalking the pace, lacked room off heels in midstretch, came in then got out from the rail, split foes a sixteenth out and
 surged late under energetic handling to get up on the line while bumping with the runner-up. QUINNIE stalked three deep, bid outside the leader on the
 backstretch, bid again alongside that one on the second turn, took a short lead in the stretch, inched away past midstretch and just failed to hold off the
 winner. LADY PHYLLIS chased outside then off the rail, went three wide on the second turn and four wide into the stretch and finished with interest.
 EMPRESS OF LOV pulled and chased a bit off the rail, swung three deep into the stretch and found her best stride late. WE WILL RE JOYCE stalked the
 pace three wide to the stretch and lacked the needed rally. MIDNIGHT SUMMER pulled between horses early, stalked between foes to the stretch and
 could not offer the necessary response. MAMA'S KID had speed outside foes then inched away on the first turn, angled in and set the pace inside, inched
 away from the runner-up into the second turn then dueled inside leaving that turn and into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. WINSINFASHION
 saved ground stalking the pace throughout and weakened in the stretch. STYLITUDE broke inward and slowly, settled off the pace inside, went outside a
 rival on the second turn and four wide into the stretch and lacked a further response.
