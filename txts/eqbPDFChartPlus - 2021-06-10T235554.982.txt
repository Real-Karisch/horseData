 HOT SRIRACHA set the pace near the rail, was confidently handled, pulled away and was under some urging near the eighth pole. LUCID DREAM chased
 the pace, was put to a drive near the three eighths pole, drifted four wide turning for home and weakened. DEDICATED , two wide on the turn, drifted out
 near the three sixteenths pole and failed to rally. LOVELY GAMES stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide and retreated through the stretch. JEDDO
 was outrun. PRAISE THE MOON hopped at the break, advanced inside horses mid way down the backstretch, weakened on the turn and faltered in the
 stretch.

 SMOKIN HOT FACTOR , between rivals into the turn, emerged as the closest pursuer after being put to a ride mid turn, closed in under right handed
 rousing, was floated out well into the track near mid stretch, took over with about a sixteenth remaining and eagerly moved away while kept to task.
 MCPHERSON vied inside of JACK OF SPADES before moving well clear around the far turn, set the pace off the inside, was guided four to five wide into
 the lane, drifted out further nearing the furlong grounds, could not resist the winner but continued willingly to be clear for the place. I'VE GOTTA PLAN , off
 the pace, angled out leaving the three eighths, moved up in upper stretch then flattened out late. BELMONTE , four wide leaving the far turn, failed to
 menace. STRIVE FOR A CURE drifted out at the break, was corrected and raced off the pace and off the inside, angled very wide for the drive but failed to
 follow through in the final three sixteenths. JACK OF SPADES flashed speed while vying outside MCPHERSON, failed to keep pace leaving the far turn and
 faltered.

 MAJORIE MUGS prompted the pace three wide around the turn and weakened in the drive. HOLY FREEDOM set a pressured pace in the two path and
 weakened through the stretch. SHE BE SASSY , fractious in the starting gate, showed speed along the inner rail and weakened. COUNTRY LINEDANCER
 raced in the four path on the turn and gave way in the stretch. SAY YES TO ME , rank when breaking awkwardly, trailed.

 PORT LOUIS took a short lead early on and handled outside pressure while nudged along, moved clear into the turn, opened up when asked for a bit more
 soon into the lane, kept on under repeated right handed encouragement and held sway. SPECIAL INTENTION , taken to rate outside a rival, dropped in
 around the turn, cut the corner advancing into the stretch, shifted out and closed willingly to gain. ARKADAG saved ground early, angled out leaving the half
 mile marker and was put to a strong ride, circled four wide into the lane but lacked a solid finish. MAJESTIC DOCTOR forced the pace outside the winner,
 saw that one get away entering the lane and gave way. MOKHEEF angled in around the turn and failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 BEYOND FOREVER , sluggish from the gate, lagged back while saving ground, came under a ride leaving the far turn, eased out into the lane, worked
 between rivals leaving the eighth pole, kept on under left handed rousing, gained a slim lead to the inside of JUSTA SCOCH in deep stretch and prevailed.
 JUSTA SCOCH settle well back, angled five to six wide gathering momentum into the stretch, rallied to command a furlong out, dug in when confronted from
 her inside, dueled late and just missed in a game effort. EMMA'SDIAMONDDIVA , far back to mid turn, swung seven to eight wide entering the lane, ranged
 up outside the top pair leaving mid stretch then flattened out late. COWBOY'S PLAN pulled her way clear early, set a rated pace two wide, opened up
 around the turn, was reeled in near mid stretch and weakened late. BLAMEITONTHEKISS stalked three wide, moved closer under a ride past the three
 eighths, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. WAITING FOR A STAR , four wide between rivals early, dropped back around the turn
 and came up empty. I LOVE YOU , five wide, was under a ride past the three eighths and gave way. LOUISE saved ground and tired after six furlongs.
 AWESOME JAZZ , taken to rate four to five wide, lacked a kick past mid turn and faltered.

 TOM HAGEN set the pace well off the rail, was under some hand urging in the stretch and held sway without competition. EDICT saved ground around the
 turn, chased the winner and was best of the rest. CLOSER LOOK raced in the two path between horses around the turn and gave way in the stretch run.
 STUDIO B , four wide on the turn, failed to rally. LIELIELIE bobbled at the break, raced inside horses throughout and was no factor. SEVEN ON THE
 ROCKS , six deep leaving the turn, was not a factor. STAND MY GROUND lacked speed, angled to the five path between horses leaving the turn and failed
 to rally. GLORIOUS WEEKEND chased the pace three wide on the turn and gave way.

 Footnotes
 BELLE SAISON broke a step slow, recovered and moved up between rivals, took command inside foes near the half mile marker, was nursed along taking
 outside pressure, shook clear into the lane, widened under a drive near the sixteenth pole then was geared down a bit late. WOLVERETTE vied between
 rivals around the turn, failed to kick on with the winner heading to mid stretch but kept trying and saved the place. A LITTLE INFO , four wide while three
 deep forcing the pace, kept up the pressure into the lane then came up empty. BUDDHA KAI , in range to the half mile marker, faltered and was eased late.
 WONOFTHESEDAYZ refused to break. There was an inquiry to the start of WONOFTHESEDAYZ. No action was deemed necessary. Due to a malfunction,
 the backup timer was used for all fractions.

 Footnotes
 LIZ'S SMILE set the pace in the two path around the turn, steadily pulled away and was under brisk urging in the stretch. LOVE'S LEGEND stalked the
 pace, saved ground around the turn, offered a mild advance to mid stretch, failed to challenge the winner and dug in stubbornly late to hold the place. RAG
 TOP circled the turn four wide and failed to rally in an even effort. BRUSHING lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
 KNOCK OUT KID prompted the pace three wide on the turn and gave way through the stretch.
