 Footnotes
 CELTIC MOONLIGHT moved up inside just after the start to take over the lead, widened along inside to clearer advantage, continued sharp and clear under
 steady encouragement. MY THIRD EYE got bumped at the start then moved up closer and rated just off early leaders, sent driving three wide into the lane,
 could not reach eventual winner but produced solid bid for second best. DANA'S RIDE broke in and bumped with rivals at the start, roused two wide turning
 for home, gained position then continued in steady pursuit to secure share. TRUE MOTION tracked the top two leaders racing five wide through the
 backstretch, loomed up boldly near the quarter pole then came out wide losing ground entering lane, roused back up then flattened in final furlong. CARD
 SPUN got bumped at the start then lacked speed and saved ground along inside, hustled up top stretch but lacked needed response for impact. JOEL'S
 SENORITA chased eventual winner through the turn then came up empty in the lane.

 WISE WARRIOR was rated in early stages then picked up pace midway through turn, roused forward and dug in between rivals a furlong out, continued to
 gain on leader moving up close in tandem with EQUITY, got up between to nail rival on the wire. KEY THE STORM broke sharp and sprinted clear,
 continued clear still unasked entering top stretch, began to show signs of fatigue and put under strong ride at eighth pole, continued driving right handed still
 on top approaching wire, got nailed by head bob. EQUITY veered out and bumped back end of rival at start, raced in contention five wide through
 backstretch, sent driving in same path entering lane, began to gain on leader while racing on near equal terms with eventual winner, got up step too late.
 HARASAN raced in contention in pursuit of pacesetter, lost some action going through the turn then hustled back up three to four wide, evenly. TAMPER
 raced in range then roused for more going through turn, kept on two path entering lane then had nothing left in reserve. SHOT JAK lacked early speed then
 lugged in through the stretch. PARTAGAS WAY raced off the pace, saved ground in early stages then urged along outside in lane to no avail. SAILER'S
 COMPANION got bumped then bobbled at the start, trailed in the back, easing up in lane, never persevered with.

 SOUTHERN SIS showed speed from outside, cleared and moved closer to inside, vied for lead racing inside of PUBLICIST through the backstretch, shook
 free in far turn, cut corner entering the lane, held narrow lead then came under right handed encouragement, responded willingly and kicked away.
 DEVILISH ROMANCE was taken to back in early stages, continued unhurried, circled up closer six wide in far turn, came out wide losing ground entering

 sent driving three wide upper stretch and produced solid finish. SYLVER MAGIC led the way in first turn, widened on top to clear advantage, remained clear
 and unasked leaving far turn, set down driving in final furlong, got outkicked late. HOLD THAT KITTEN was rated off clear pacesetter in early stages, cut the
 corner entering the lane, moved up in close range then gaveway in late drive. JUST SASSY raced in or near the back, hustled up along outside top stretch,
 improved position without threatening. EASTER ACT took closer order in far turn, raced along outside then steadied upper stretch, failed to move on after.
 LOOK IT LINDA was nearest pursuer off clear pacesetter, sent driving near the quarter pole then came up empty in the lane. PEACFULWARRIORGIRL

 Footnotes
 GALTON angled in from outside to secure inside position in first turn, continued to save ground while settled in stalking position, inched up just off top pair,
 waited then cut the corner entering lane, could not get through inside, angled out then shown whip past eighth pole to challenge CHARLIE MOPS for the
 lead, briefly matched strides then given final cue and pulled away. CHARLIE MOPS led the way at the start then came under pressure from MY POINT
 EXACTLY, continued pressured pace through the backstretch, could not shake off stubborn foe then final began to edge away past the quarter pole, briefly
 held clear on top then back under challenge by GALTON, had no kick left in late reserve to move on, good effort. TUTTI SANNO settled near midpack in
 early stages, angled out and hustled up past quarter pole, continued driving along outside and finished with good response. BLUE HARBOR raced in or
 near the back of field, angled to rail approaching eighth pole, roused forward with good response then failed to sustain needed kick for serious impact.
 PILOTING was rated off early pace, made move past three eighths pole, took closer order then set down driving along outside in lane, failed to move on.
 BLACKOUT (FR) rated of early pace then moved up closer and sat well positioned in far turn, loomed up boldly at quarter pole, continued in contention then
 gaveway in final furlong. MY POINT EXACTLY applied pace pressure to CHARLIE MOPS in early stages and continued in far turn, could not maintain in
 touch with rival at quarter pole then gaveway in the lane. ORPHEUS (ARG) raced in the back and saved ground through backstretch then lacked needed
 rally in lane. SEMBLANCE OF ORDER raced in close range then began to weaken three furlongs out.
