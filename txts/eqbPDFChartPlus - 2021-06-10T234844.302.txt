 HERE'S HANNAH away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear lead in the run down the backstretch while
 under wraps, was asked for run leaving the final turn, and widened her advantage while being ridden out in the late stages. LUXOR LADY stalked the
 leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, advanced from along the inside midway down the backstretch, rallied smartly along the rail
 through the final turn, was no match for the winner in the drive, but closed willingly from along the rail to prove clearly second best. DORYS DARLIN broke
 sharply and stalked the leaders through the first turn while racing two out from the rail, advanced three wide midway down the backstretch, continued her
 pursuit three wide entering the turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive in a solid effort. ASTARTE away well and settled off the early leaders while
 racing two out from the rail through the first turn, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed evenly two out from the rail in the drive. ESSI ROSE
 settled off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive.
 CONVERGENT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three out from the rail entering the final turn, and
 closed with late interest four wide in the drive. PORTO RICAN QUEEN tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, chased the
 pacesetter to the final turn, before weakening. FLUCTUATION settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, and failed to respond
 when called upon.

 TINDERETTE settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, advanced from along the inside
 midway down the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, tipped two wide leaving the turn and quickly took command entering the stretch
 and drew clear under confident handling. DONTTELLMYHUSBAND settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first
 time, advanced three wide midway down the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive to prove
 clearly second best. EXTRAMARITAL broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the
 backstretch, held a narrow advantage through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly in the drive in a solid outing. SUSAN'S DAY away alertly and dueled
 for the lead two wide entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final
 turn, but faded in the stretch drive. BELLI GIRL unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a
 serious impact. WINNING EDGE away well and eased off the dueling leaders entering the stretch the first time to assume a tracking trip one out from the
 rail, maintained her position in the run to the final turn, rallied three wide through the turn, but faded in the stretch drive.

 CRACKDOWN away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
 backstretch, opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and widened his margin through the lane under confident handling. SHOOTING JACKET
 settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly four
 wide in the drive to get up for the place in the final strides. SILVERTOWN stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied
 three wide through the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive and just failed to hold the place. FETISOV tracked the leader into the
 backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run to the final turn, was unable to match strides with CRACKDOWN while
 commencing his bid two wide entering the final turn, and battled determinedly from just off the rail in the drive in a game effort. CAPTAIN JONES unhurried
 early while dropping back to trail, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. DASHING DON
 away alertly and stalked the leader from along the rail into the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final
 furlong. ROCK VICTOR broke sharply and dueled for the lead two wide in the run to the first turn, bore out entering the turn, chased the pacesetter five wide
 in the run down the backstretch, but had nothing left entering the final turn.

 Footnotes
 LORD VANCOUVER away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue from the
 outside of OMEGA VICTORY in the run to the final turn, continued to battle with that rival through the final turn, gained command entering the stretch, and
 held the closers safely at bay late. SANAWAR tracked the leaders in the rail down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied two out from
 the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. SILENT NATIVE unhurried early while dropping back to
 trail, rallied three wide through the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to get up for a share in the final strides. OMEGA VICTORY broke
 sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch
 and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly in the drive while racing one out from the rail. WE FOUND GOLD away well and stalked the leaders
 through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide between rivals in deep
 stretch. STANZ IN COMMAND settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide through the final
 turn, but needed more when called upon in the late going. B C CHARLIE stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the
 rail, began to drop back midway down the backstretch and offered nothing in the late stages.

 HEARTSET broke sharply and settled off the leader while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, advanced into a stalking trip from just
 off the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, battled into the stretch from the inside of TOCCET'S
 CHARM, inched clear in deep stretch and held off a late charge from CITRON KID to prevail. CITRON KID lagged well back in the early going while saving
 ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped four wide entering the lane and closed determinedly to get up for the
 place in the final strides. TOCCET'S CHARM settled off the early leaders while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to save
 ground through the second turn while gaining on the leader, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, took the narrowest of advantages leaving the
 turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the late stages. FLEMINGS BEACH away well and rushed to a clear advantage entering the stretch the first time,
 controlled the pace through the second turn and into the backstretch, was collared entering the final turn, and gave way grudgingly while being outfinished
 late. MIGHTY MESA settled off the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished
 three out from the rail in the stretch drive. INSTANT CASH was off to an awkward start, and dropped well behind the field in the early running, rallied two
 wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive. KILLARNEY KID settled off the early pace while racing four wide
 through the stretch the first time, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied five wide through the final turn, but was unable to make a
 late impact while finishing three wide in the drive. WHAT GOES AROUND lagged well back in the early stages while racing two wide through the stretch the
 first time, rallied five wide through the final turn, but needed more when called upon. WAR ON settled off the early leaders while racing just out from the rail
 through the stretch the first time, raced two wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. ROSIES NOTIS away
 alertly and settled off the early leaders while racing three wide through the stretch the first time, loomed a danger while commencing his bid four wide
 entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

 HALLOWEEN QUEEN broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from just off the rail in the run down
 the backstretch, maintained her advantage through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. FLAMING YOUTH tracked the leader into the

 ALDERGLORY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the first turn, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed
 determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to be along for a share. DHATZIT away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground
 at the rail, continued to save ground while commencing her bid entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. SAKURA settled off the

 some late interest in the drive. TOTAL DEFENCE away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide
 entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. IRISH LASS settled well back in the early going, while shying away from rivals in the run to the

 trip in the run down the backstretch, raced five wide into the final turn, and wasn't persevered with in the late stages.
