 Footnotes
 KULANI chased the earlier pace about the three path, drew aim in the four path approaching the top of the lane, took the lead inside the eighth pole and
 dueled clear later yards. WINDSOR CALLING chased the pace off the rail, closed to the heels of the top three nearing the head of the lane, angled four
 wide in the upper stretch and dug in for second the final yards. NOSEY NORTON pressured the pace inside, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the
 rail rounding the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. IMA CAT GENIUS hustled clear and angled toward the inside to set a pressured pace,
 contested the edge two deep rounding the turn but gave up the nod inside the eighth pole and flattened stride. EL ORO gave chase leaving the chute then
 never factored. UNSUSPECTED gave chase toward the inside, showed little response from the onset, was pulled up appearing lame in mid-stretch and
 vanned off. APPROVING SONDE stumbled badly and lost his rider at the start. The stewards posted the inquiry before declaring this race official. Per
 stewards ruling #47, Kulani is disqualified from earnings.

 Footnotes
 RESCUE FIVE came away sharply and angled to the inside to set the pace, widened the advantage through the turn and was steadily handled down the
 lane. ANAZARA gave early chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the three path, dueled for second mid-stretch, though, proved no match for the
 winner. EUTAW STREET chased the pace from the inside, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little more. GRAND FIBER gave chase through the
 backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little further. INDIAN SOUND chased the pace inside, checked in tight at the rail nearing the
 quarter pole then faded rounding the turn.

 K TOWN BRASS took the lead soon after the start and rated the pace inside, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, drew clear toward the quarter
 and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. RIGHTEOUS MAN settled off the pace inside, bid past the three eighths pole, raced four wide on the far
 turn and was gaining on the winner through later yards. BOUNDTOBEGOOD raced off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far
 turn three wide and finished evenly. ORIOLES MAGIC rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at
 the rail then flattened out down the lane. MERRY MERRY MOJO settled off the pace and off the rail, showed little response through the backstretch and
 could only improve his position. BLACK STEEL tapered in to stalk the winner two deep, challenged that one nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back
 toward the quarter and weakened.
