 Footnotes
 DUSTWHIRL WONDER broke with the leaders, settled off the pace, patiently handled early turn, moved closer three wide entering the stretch, outside bid,
 wore down rival. SHOOK back off the early pace in the run up the backstretch, advanced and took over early in the turn, was clear briefly late in the bend,
 responded when the winner challenged nearing the furlong grounds, could not match strides with that one late, clearly second best. ANGEL CAT void of
 early foot, swung out five wide into the stretch, finished up best of the rest. KOHENSRISING lacked early foot, advanced into a contending position while in
 the two path and in traffic turn, flattened out in the drive. OUR LADY'S PRAYER chased the early, vied into the early part of the turn, weakened in the drive.
 MY HALF last to leave, advanced to a forward position while four wide into the turn, gave way entering the stretch, rank, continued to fade. FINE POINT
 broke on top, flashed speed up the backstretch inside, stopped in the turn. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, HALF MILE FRACTIONAL TIME
 UNAVAILABLE.

 Footnotes
 AND YET ANOTHER outrun in the early going, made a good gain to become prominent in the second turn, put a head in front nearing midst etch, began to
 edge away from that rival a sixteenth out then had enough left to narrowly hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. MR. BIG CITY forwardly placed
 early, fell back the middle half, came again late to be getting to the winner in the final strides. THUNDER BOX dueled up front off the inside through the first
 turn, continued to press the issue in the run up the backstretch, vied between rivals into the lane, proved stubborn to the end. KUBO CAT settled off the
 pace inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, continued in even fashion through the stretch in lacking a late punch. CALL ME DUSTY void
 of speed while racing toward the inside, saved some ground into the lane, improved position a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat.
 CAPTAINONTHEROCKS failed to menace while racing outside. AMBASSADOR HOUSE dueled up front along the inside, gave way in the drive. CAESAR
 POINT within striking distance while racing outside, also faltered in the drive.

 CHAOSMOS asked away from the gate to maintain inside position, edged clear first turn, rated while showing the way up the backstretch by daylight,
 expanded that advantage through the final turn, won geared down late to be ridden. KINGDOM WAY settled off the pace and the inside, advanced to be
 closest to the winner into the stretch, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. DON'T SPLIT TENS chased the winner most of the way while off
 the inside, proved no match for that rival in the drive nor the runner up, comfortably saved the show. DEBRIYN settled off the pace, lacked a serious
 response in the drive. SIMBA'S PRIDE void of any early speed, never a threat. ROLLWITHIT forwardly placed for four furlongs, gave way.

 SMOK'N RITA outrun in the early going, began a steady advance after a half, challenged between the two leaders when straightened for home, put a head
 in front with a furlong remaining and drove well clear. BELLAMY CAY prompted the early pace off the inside, advanced to duel before a half, got out turning
 for home, proved no match for the winner late, held the place. THIS IS MY PRAYER took control after the start, dueled the middle half, headed in the
 second turn, briefly regained the advantage when that rival got out turning for home, also could not keep pace with the winner the final furlong, outkicked
 late for the place. J.'S GIRL four wide when within striking distance in the first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch, went one paced through the stretch
 in lacking a late response. ROSALENE forwardly placed for a half, had little left for the drive. KEEN'S SHOT last away, was finished early, fell far back, lost
 contact with the field to be distanced, walked across finish line.

 DESTINY AWAITS outrun for a almost a half, advanced into the stretch, split foes nearing midstretch, challenged soon after, quickly drove clear.
 BOOTSIE'S GALAXY broke alertly, prompted the leader from the outside in the run up the backstretch, took over in the turn, offered little resistance to the
 winner the final furlong, clearly second best. DISTINCT QUALITY broke out, brushed, raced back, staged a mild rally to annex the show while well out in the
 strip. DREWZANO within striking distance out in the strip, roused four wide into the lane, came up empty, missed the show late. ICE CITY GHOST steadied
 at the start, trailed most of the way and failed to threaten. JAZZ IT UP away in good order, set the early pace, gave way when headed turning for home.

 SO SORRY RUSTON last away, was outrun early inside, continued to save ground turn, eased out a bit when straightened for home, finished full of run to
 win going away. RIVER BOBCAT chased the early leader, advanced and challenged that one from along the inside late in the turn, briefly dueled, shook
 clear, proved no match in containing the winner, remained clear for the place. MY PAL TORRES away in good order, one paced behind the leaders, lacked
 a significant closing response, narrowly saved the show. WARRIOR'S KID void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat.
 SNAPPER BITE settled off the pace, lacked a response in the drive. WILDWOOD DEJAVU broke on top, sprinted clear through a quick opening quarter,
 allowed the runner up the inside turning for home, and stopped.

 ALYS APPOINTMENT asked early to maintain position between horses, relaxed behind the two leaders through the turn, set down in the three path when
 straightened for home, finished with good late energy to be up in time. FATS away well, pressured the early leader from the outside, joined that rival to duel
 through the turn and upper stretch, led late, could not contain the winner in the final strides, proved game for the place. IPIDATE broke alertly, showed the
 way along the inside up the backstretch, dueled turn, gave ground grudgingly to the top two late, remained clear of the others. WHISTLING WIND in the
 second flight while racing off the inside, called on for run while four wide turning for home, managed some late interest. ICE PEAK turned in an even effort
 while saving all the ground. HIDDEN DATA last away, trailed early, improved position through some traffic down the stretch. NATEALYZE was never a
 serious contender. GIANT MESA lacked a rally while racing off the inside. COUNTACH remained always back. HOOPS CIGAR within striking distance in
 the early going, steadily backed up through the stretch. EMMA'S LOGIC was finished early while racing wide.

 SEATTLE BREW forwardly placed from the start after breaking in good order, advanced and challenged wide into the lane, drove well clear. EMILY JO back
 early, began to move closer in the four path before a half, set down into then lane, finished willingly and with good determination to earn the place, not a
 threat to the winner. TEMPLE SHADOW settled off the pace but within striking distance inside, moved out a bit in the two path for the drive, lacked a
 winning response, outkicked for the place. FORT POLK clear early in showing the way through the first turn, dueled the middle half, closest to the winner
 midstretch, weakened late to lose a couple of positions. TAP DANCE STAR void of speed for six furlongs, improved position in the drive while finding her
 best stride too late. KRAFT'S RATE chased the leader early, advanced to duel the middle half, between foes turning for home, faltered. BELLA CAJUN
 never menaced. SAINTS N MUSKETS pulled early while off the pace, finished after a half.

 Footnotes
 DIXIE BEAT void of early foot, came three wide out of the turn when beginning to advance, shifted out widest when straightened for home, closed with good
 resolve late to be up in time. MIGHTY INTIMIDATOR forwardly placed from the start, dueled out of the turn closest to the inside, led late, nipped, held place.
 HE'S A LADY TAMER settled in mid pack early toward the inside, steered out upper stretch, not enough late for the place while between the top two.
 COUGAR COUNTRY prompted the pace off the inside, dueled turn outside the runner up, weakened in the late going to lose the place. REBEL
 GENTLEMAN within striking distance off the inside, in good position turning for home, had little left for the drive. LEFTFIELDJUNCTION last away, trailed
 early, picked up a couple of tiring rivals. HOT TEN was never a threat. WICKED PROUD flashed early speed along the inside, staged a steady retreat.
