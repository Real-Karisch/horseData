 Footnotes
 DECISION REVERSED chased the pacesetter from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, caught the leader nearing the
 eighth pole then quickly drove past and widened. BENEDICTION saved ground through the turn and into the lane, began gaining momentum inside the
 eighth pole and was under a drive to gain the place spot. OPPIDUM was away alertly and gained the lead well before the first call, cleared into the turn,
 remained clear through the turn and into the lane, was no match when collared near the eighth pole and just was able to save the show spot along the
 inside. MORDECAI was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and finished evenly. EASY DOER chased the pace from
 the three path into the lane then lacked a response once straightened. FATHER BUD was never a factor while in the three path through the turn. TWENTY
 GAUGE made no impact while saving ground into the lane.

 Footnotes
 SHATTERPROOF was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole, swung into the lane from the
 five path, took aim from mid-track and just caught the leader near the wire. UNBRIDLED BOILER stalked the pace from the three path through mid-turn,
 moved to challenge for the lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled while straightening in the lane, shook clear near the eighth pole then could not hold the
 winner safe late. ROAD TO JUSTICE chased the pacesetters through the turn while in the two or three path, came into the lane from the four path then
 finished evenly. SENOR SALSA chased the pace into the turn from the three path, moved to vie for the lead into the lane, dueled to outside the eighth pole
 then yielded to the others. GAME FACE ON raced up close down the backstretch, settled back into the turn and was never a serious threat. HONOLULU
 BLUE was near the rail throughout and never factored. SWITCH PLATE ducked into the gap a couple strides out of the gate and lost his rider, was caught
 after entering the clubhouse straight and walked off. RUSTIC JUSTICE hustled out to lead into the turn, began dropping back in late turn and was pulled up
 outside the eighth pole and walked off.

 Footnotes
 TWO CARROT RANSOM stumbled at the start, moved up to stalk the two rival duel through the turn while racing in the four path, bid into the lane, caught
 the leaders soon after straightening then edged away inside the sixteenth pole. BOLD CONCEPT was void of any early speed, gained momentum in
 mid-turn while in the three path, continued with a steady pace, caught a couple rivals in the last seventy yards and continued on with good energy to the
 wire to be clear for the place spot. AMY'S LIL BIT dueled for the lead into the turn, continued under pressure into late turn, was joined by another along the
 inside entering the lane, dueled with that one to the eighth pole then was no match for the top two late. MI LUNA was bumped at the start, raced along the
 inside through the turn, cut the corner and benefited as others stayed wide, was a serious threat after straightening in the lane then hung inside the
 sixteenth pole. ROYAL KNIGHTOWL vied for the lead while two wide through mid-turn, began to lose touch with the pacesetter in late turn then was empty
 entering the lane. KISSESFORDAMOMMA was never a factor while in the three path through the turn. CERTAINLY A BELLE chased the pace along the
 inside early then began a steady retreat after entering the turn.

 quarter pole, then improved position late. HALLELUJAH CHORUS was pinballed at the start, then passed tired foes. SHE'S OBVIOUS bore out at the start,
 then saved ground. UTTERLY RACHEL broke sharply, led inside, then gave way in the drive. FLY BABY GIRL FLY stalked the pace inside before fading in
 the stretch. PILOT VIOLET was pinballed at the start. HOPE SWEET HOPE was through early and was eased.

 Footnotes
 RASCOFRADE was unrushed in the four path, rallied at the quarter pole and was up in time under steady urging. TEQUILA AND SALT led inside, was clear
 in the stretch but couldn't hold off the winner. NAKED BOOTLEG stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, then hung in the stretch.
 VOODOOTHATYOUDO stalked the pace in the three path, bid on the far turn, then faltered in the stretch. BETITALLWITHPAUL pressed the pace outside
 to the far turn before giving way. ENGLISH FLOWER raced evenly. EXPECT INDY stalked the early pace in the three path before giving way. SHOW ME
 INDY stalked the early pace inside. NORMAN'S CONQUEST was not a factor.
