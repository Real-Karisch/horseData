 Footnotes
 PHONE MY POSSE broke inward then went up and vied for the lead, let the leader skip a bit clear and settled to track, turned for home going two wide then
 hit his best stride with a furlong to go and got up in time. SLEEPIN N CHEATIN edged clear of foes as the race went on until the eighth pole, dug in as the
 closers bore down but was sniped on the line. NICKY C trailed well off the field, swung into the stretch in the six path then closed with a rush. SKYLANDER
 BOY got in tight at the start then shrugged it off to track the pace on the outside, went two wide around the turn but swung into the stretch in the four path
 with a long rally in tow. MAJESTIC DOCTOR tracked the pace between horses, went into the stretch in the three path and ran all out through the finish. I
 WROTE THE SCRIPT tracked the pace on the inside but had to swing into the five path at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally.

 Footnotes
 PERENNIAL eagerly stalked the pace between horses going two wide around the turns, took the lead with ease at the quarter pole, drew off, and was
 ridden out under the line. INTO THE EAST stalked the pace on the outside going three wide around both turns then proved to be second best. PENITENCE
 had a sluggish start then ran towards the rear but was able to pass tired rivals. HONEYDUKES went five wide around the first turn while tracking the pace
 then had no response. STEIDLE tracked the pace going four wide around the first turn, swung for home going two wide then faded. DIVINE KITTEN ran
 towards the rear, swung into the stretch in the four path then finished evenly. ALILBIT SHADY got a bit rank as the field went into the first turn while running
 in the two path, sat well rated off the pace then turned for home in the three path but weakened. OUR PHILLY GIRL had a clear lead most of the way but
 folded up at the quarter pole. INVERNESS stalked the pace on the inside then came up empty. INTO THE EAST RACED AS ISLAND ROMANCE.
