 Footnotes
 CAYMANS COBRA prompted the pace three deep, poked his head in front a furlong out, shook off FRONT DOOR late and edged clear. FRONT DOOR set
 the pressured pace along the inside, fought on through a long drive, was unable to resist the winner, but was clearly second best. PRYOR lunged at the
 start, moved up between horses, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened during the drive. HE TAKES CHARGE was unhurried, tucked in to save
 ground, shifted out entering the stretch and improved position. PENALTY was allowed to settle, made a sweeping move five wide, but faltered once
 straightened in the stretch. OSKAR BLUES was forwardly placed along the inside to the second turn and tired. RULER OF THE NILE tracked three wide for
 six furlongs and dropped out.

 BEE JERSEY set the pace along the inside, shook clear at will entering the stretch and widened. FRAMMENTO broke slow, was unhurried along the inside,
 got through and finished willingly to earn the place. HAN SENSE was forwardly placed along the inside, shifted out and made his bid between horses, but
 flattened and settled for the show. ICATIRO was allowed to settle, made a sweeping move five wide, loomed large entering the stretch, but failed to sustain
 the drive. RISE UP prompted the pace three wide, but faltered between rivals on the second turn and faded. ACTION EVERYDAY contended three wide to
 the second turn and dropped out.

 JUST WHISTLE settled saving ground, ranged into striking distance through the second turn, shifted out and drew even three-sixteenths out, shook off his
 challengers and edged clear. CAVARADOSSI set the pressured pace along the inside, kept on well through a long drive but was unable to resist the winner.
 RUSHIN TOTHECIRCLE settled saving ground, got through and finished willingly for the show. BRAVE NATION contended along the inside, tipped out
 between horses, lost ground through the second turn, angled out further entering the stretch and continued on fairly well through the lane. INDIGO YANKEE
 was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground, rallied along the inside and improved position. GAMBIT contended off of the inside, offered a mild bid
 leaving the second turn, but failed to sustain the drive. GRAHAM'S WAY prompted the pace three wide, but weakened between horses entering the stretch
 and faded. ARKADAG passed the tiring ones. TRAVELLING MIDAS contended four wide, but came up empty before going six furlongs and retreated.
 ROYAL EDITION was hustled along five wide for five furlongs and dropped out. VICTORY LANE showed little.

 GREAT was back early on, shifted into the three path in the far turn and improved position down the lane. AURORA WAY stalked the pace early, shifted into
 the four path in the far turn and faded late in the stretch drive. HOLLYWOOD HANDSOME came out at the start and was bumped, chased the pace early
 on, fanned into the five path in the far turn and was empty in the stretch. RAFTING fought restraint early on, tracked the pace down the backstretch, shifted
 into the three path in the far turn and was tired in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 TRIPLE CHELSEA settled in hand three deep, tipped out further with three-sixteenths to run, quickened under left handed urging, reeled in LADY AURELIA
 and edged clear. LADY AURELIA stalked the pace three wide, launched a bold bid entering the stretch, forged a narrow lead nearing the furlong marker,
 kept on well but was unable to resist the winner. MORTICIA contested the pace along the inside, but flattened in the final furlong and settled for the minor
 award. EXCESSIVESPENDING settled saving ground, shifted out leaving the turn, kicked on and was making up ground. JENNIFER LYNNETTE was
 allowed to settle, angled out entering the stretch to be clear, but lacked the needed late response. STORM THE HILL came away a step slow, was
 unhurried into stride and failed to threaten. THERE'SYOURTROUBLE was forwardly placed along the inside, but came up empty leaving the turn and faded.
 LADY TO THE MAX was never a factor. BRAVE DAISEY was away alertly, angled in to set the pressured pace, but was through before going a half and
 dropped out.

 MY BOY JACK raced far back early on, began a rally along the far turn, shifted into the four path entering the lane, made a bid three wide near the eighth
 pole and edged past the leader under a long drive in the final stages. TELEKINESIS stalked the pace early along the inside down the backstretch, angled off
 the rail entering the lane, inched clear in the stretch from the inside, drifted out a bit under a long drive and was caught in the final stages. PONY UP trailed
 the field early on while far back, swung into the six path in the far turn, rallied down the lane with a late gain in the final stages. GREYVITOS set the pace
 early, shifted into the three path in the far turn, was met from both sides near the eighth pole and faltered late in the drive. SEVEN TRUMPETS chased the
 pace early, shifted into the three path in the far turn while making a bid but faded late in the stretch run. ZANESVILLE was in tight shortly after leaving the
 gate and raced back early on, angled off the rail in the far turn and moved up in the stretch drive. HONOR UP was well placed early on, shifted into the four
 path in the far turn while making a bid but was empty down the lane. NAVY ARMED GUARD was bumped at the start, stalked the pace early, shifted into
 the three path in the far turn and was tired in the stretch. GRACIDA came out at the start, tracked the pace early, shifted into the four path in the far turn and
 was tired down the lane. ARCHED FEATHER was done early.

 SISTERCHARLIE (IRE) settled in hand off of the inside, got through to make her bid, shifted out entering the stretch, split rivals and kicked on. FOURSTAR
 CROOK was unhurried into stride, took closer order through the second turn, came four wide, angled in nearing the furlong marker, found clear sailing and
 finished full of run. OFF LIMITS (IRE) contended between horses, was floated out by her stablemate entering the stretch, continued on well but settled for
 the minor award. LA CORONEL stalked the pace three wide, drew even on the second turn, but weakened slightly during the drive and gave way. DONA
 BRUJA (ARG) opened clear to set the pace, was collared on the second turn, disputed the issue to the final furlong and succumbed. CAMBODIA was
 forwardly placed along the inside, tipped out entering the stretch, was fanned out further and weakened between horses. KITTEN'S ROAR contended three
 wide, came five wide but failed to make headway. PROCTOR'S LEDGE settled between horses, was carried out entering the stretch and failed to threaten.
 BLETCHLEY (GB) saved ground to no avail. ULTRA BRAT was allowed to settle, swung wide entering the stretch, but lacked a response when called upon.
 LOVELY BERNADETTE was close up four wide, but came up empty between foes entering the stretch and dropped out.

 Footnotes
 ALBEROBELLO tracked the pace early three wide, shifted into the four path in the turn, took over command in the stretch then drew off late under a brisk
 drive. URBAN INSIGHT set the pace early, angled off the rail in the turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch but was second best. SONG OF MINE
 was back early on, swung into the six path in the turn and moved up in the stretch run. DESERT ISLE was back early on, fanned into the five path in the turn
 and improved position in the stretch drive. HANALEI MOON swung into the six path in the turn and improved position. LET'S ROLL chased the pace early,
 shifted into the three path in the turn and faded late in the stretch. SILLA MANILA was well placed early on, shifted into the four path in the turn and was
 empty in the stretch. SPARK JOY had early speed then folded up. LADY CREED altered nearing the lane and was outrun. MY SISTER'S KEEPER had brief
 speed from between horses and eased down the lane. HAZEL ANN I AM went wrong near the quarter pole and was vanned off.
