 CUTTER HELM saved ground on the first turn, moved to the lead when LATE NITE MISCHIEF lugged out late on that bend, was well rated while setting a
 clear pace, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, passed the furlong marker in the two path, came in under a right-handed whip and
 bothered the runner-up shortly thereafter then held under strong urging. MUCH TROUBLE began the first turn in the four path, was carried around seven
 wide late on that bend, angled in early on the backstretch, was reserved off the pace, hugged the rail on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied
 into striking position, checked when the winner came in inside the furlong marker, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for second.
 SHIITAKE saved ground on the first turn, was urged along on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch,
 gained ground on the outside, had the rider misjudge the wire at the sixteenth-pole for a few strides then was put back to urging and secured his mostly
 likely finishing position anyways while up for the show. RIDE A COMET started the first turn in the three path, was carried about six wide late on that bend,
 raced towards the front under some restraint, vied between horses in the three path on the far turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and was
 out-kicked. PUCON went three wide on the first turn, was well spotted towards the front, raced inside early on the far turn, angled three wide late on that
 bend, swung five wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, was taken up slightly while dropping back outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened. G'S
 TURN went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, lacked
 room behind horses from that point until near the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. LATE NITE MISCHIEF went two then three wide early on the first turn,
 lugged out to about the five path late on that bend, was urged along on the backstretch, chased four wide on the far turn and came up empty. LANDONESE
 rounded the first turn in the two path, followed the leader from second, made a bid with a half-mile to run, was urged along between horses in the two path
 on the far turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and capitulated. SIMBA'S PRIDE broke a step slow, saved ground on the first turn, lagged at the rear,
 was urged along while inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path and failed to threaten. JULIE'S JACKPOT broke out and a step slow, went two
 to three wide on the turns and was no factor. Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run, CUTTER HELM was disqualified from first and placed
 second for interference inside the furlong marker.

 rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to
 threaten. DISCREETLY GRAND angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground on both turns and was no factor. WIND CHILL FACTOR saved ground on

 Footnotes
 COTTON EYE GEM tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip, spun four wide into the
 stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong, took over shortly thereafter then drew away under steady urging. ANNIE HAD A BABY was urged along on
 the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch while under the whip and secured the place while no match for the winner. TRACK
 TELLER was urged along on the outside, dropped back in the three path on the turn and lacked the needed response while up for the show. EXPRESS
 YOURSELF settled at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. DIXIE JACKPOT was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two
 path on the turn and tired. ANGELIC SCORE showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside on the turn, shortened stride severely in upper stretch, lost
 the lead inside the furlong marker and faltered. BEAULEY settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the turn and failed to rally.
