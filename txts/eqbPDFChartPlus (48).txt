 Footnotes
 LADY CHROME tracked the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide then was pushed out when HANDFUL OF PEARLS pushed BRITE ECHO into her into
 the stretch, responded to pressure and held driving. VICTORIOUSLY JEWEL was outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then angled out for
 room and closed willingly to grab second. NORWEGIAN SPY tracked the leaders early, saved ground to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could
 not sustain the needed response. HANDFUL OF PEARLS hustled to the lead and dueled three wide to the turn, eased in nearing the quarter pole but
 lugged out into the path of BRITE ECHO in upper stretch then weakened late. BOLT UP had no speed, raced two wide on the turn and was making up
 ground belatedly. POP FIZZ CLINK also had no speed, saved ground and had a mild late bid. BRITE ECHO attended the pace, shifted outside of
 HANDFUL OF PEARLS on the turn, was cut off and forced to steady by that one in upper stretch and weakened. KHALAYA pressed the pace early, was
 outrun three wide to the stretch and gave way. PULPIT GOLD trailed throughout. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run and disqualified
 HANDFUL OF PEARLS from fourth to seventh for interfering with BRITE ECHO at the three sixteenths.

 Footnotes
 PURE PERFECTION tracked the leader to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch, drifted in slightly leaving
 the furlong grounds then held determinedly. OUR RENEE threw her head at the start and lost about three lengths, hurried up inside but was rank off horses
 to the half, bid two wide to the stretch then finished willingly in a good effort. STAR DREAMIN was allowed to settle to the half, raced two then three wide to
 the stretch, eased out for room in upper stretch and closed steadily. SHARI had no speed, was roused three then four wide on the second turn, swung out
 widest for the drive and came on but was too late. MISS SHIRLEY C pressed the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, was being outkicked
 by the winner when that one came in slightly leaving the furlong grounds, checked and angled out but finished evenly while not switching leads. SING IN
 THE WIND hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then was collared in mid stretch and weakened. CHRISTIANA'S SONG had no
 speed, trailed to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. MADAME WARRIOR was allowed to settle to
 the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but came up empty. RED GLITTER was four wide to the backstretch, chased to the second turn, remained four
 wide to the stretch then gave way. GIRLSINTHEOFFICE had no speed and was outrun.
