 Footnotes
 FACEY'S SISTER set the pace soon after the start, raced in the two path through the turn while clear, continued with a comfortable advantage after
 straightening in the lane then was kept busy to the wire. TRAUMARAMA chased the winner from the three path through the turn, had aim on the winner into
 the lane but could not reel her in while settling for second best. SEDUCTIVE chased the top two from the outset while in the two or three path through the
 turn, swung into the lane from the four path and finished evenly. TORNADA chased the pace from along the inside through the turn and into the lane and
 lacked a closing bid. LIL LIONNE was in the two path through the turn and was never a threat. PASS AND GO was in the three path through the turn, came
 into the lane from the five path, shifted into the seven or eight path and was never a menace. PAIGE'S STAR was in the five to the four path through the
 turn, came into the lane from the six path and tired.

 Footnotes
 STACK EM HIGH chased the pace down the backstretch, continued to chase the three rival duel through the far turn, bid four wide near the quarter pole,
 edged to the front outside the eighth pole then continued to slowly increase the advantage through the final sixteenth. MR HANEY was unhurried early,
 raced in the four path through the far turn when moving closer, bid four wide into the turn, could not catch the winner then was kept to the drive to gain the
 place spot late. TEMEMON chased the pace while off the inside, bid three wide into the far turn, gained a short lead in late turn, continued to be a contender
 into the lane, could not match strides with the winner then lost the place spot late. HITTHEGROUNDRUNNIN set the pace into the first turn while saddle
 slipped back, continued to race prominently down the backstretch and through the turn then weakened through the lane. ASPEN SNOW was unhurried
 while in the two path into the far turn, angled into the four or five path into the lane then moved up while never a threat. I'M WORTH IT chased the pace then
 moved to stalk the three leaders into the turn, began losing contact with the top ones and was empty turning for home. FLEET COMMANDER pressed then
 dueled for the lead two wide through the turn then dropped out entering the lane and faded. CHEADLE was in the five to the four path through the first turn,
 raced in the two path through the far turn and was never in it. PERLY GAITS saved ground to no avail. HAMPSHIRE CROSSING was in the five to the four
 path through the first turn, continued off the inside into the far turn and was done.

 Footnotes
 FLASHIN THEFLOWERS rated on the pace while near the inside, was put under pressure into the lane then gamely repelled the challenge and inched
 further away at the wire. E Z MAN BAND crowded and jostled at the start, chased the pace from the three path, bid three wide into the lane, moved to a
 menacing position with an eighth to go then could not get past the winner and settled for the runner-up spot. THE LAST FACTOR pressed then chased the
 pace from the three then the two path, continued to be a serious threat into the lane, was in tight between rivals inside the eighth pole then weakened late
 while still best of the rest. LUKE THE TRAIN was along the inside through the turns and moved up while never a threat. GAME FACE ON was in the two
 path through the turns, shifted into the four path entering the lane then lacked a response. IMADANDYBANDY was crowded and checked early, dropped
 back, trailed into the far turn, bid from the three to the five path through the turn, entered the lane from the six path and lacked a response.
 SHATTERPROOF was unhurried into the turn, moved up four wide when being asked in mid-turn, continued into the lane from the five path and was empty.
 ALLDAYLONG was done in mid-turn while in the three or four path.

 Footnotes
 MAJESTIC BOLD set the early pace, dueled into the far turn, inched to the lead in late turn then gamely held while all out along the inside. SILENT SOFIA
 saved ground into the far turn, bid three wide in late turn, moved closer to the inside straightening in the lane, loomed a serious threat with an eighth to go
 then could not get past he winner while slowly inching up. AIR TURBULENCE raced along the inside into the far turn, bid in mid-turn, was put in tight and
 checked in late turn, straightened into the lane then was all out to gain the show spot. MAGIC FEET raced in the three path into the far turn, bid in late turn
 to be a contender then could not gain further once straightened and lost the show spot late. DIVINING CHANGE was off to an awkward start, raced in the
 two path through the turns and never was a factor. LORAN HOLIDAY (ARG) chased the pace from the two to the four path through the far turn then tired
 through the lane. GLORY TRAIN was never a factor while racing near the rail through the turns. AGUILA NEGRA pressed then dueled for the lead into the
 far turn then retreated through the lane.

 Footnotes
 EASY DOER raced along the inside through the first turn, got through along the inside near the five-eighths pole, gained a short lead into the turn while
 under pressure from two others, relinquished the advantage in late turn, re-fired once straightened in the lane to gain a short lead then kept on well to inch
 clear late. AVERY GLENN pressed the pace three wide into the far turn, dueled with the winner through mid-turn, gained a short lead in late turn, came into
 the lane looking to extend the advantage, lost the lead with an eighth to got then could not gain thereafter. BAHNKE saved ground through the far turn,
 came into the lane from the two or three path then was all out to gain mildly and just get up for the minor share. R LUCKEY CHARLIE bid four wide through
 mid-turn, moved quickly to the leaders in late turn, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the leaders then hung through the final eighth and lost
 the show spot late. THE PREDICTOR pressed the pace two wide and between rivals early, chased the others from the three path through the turn then
 weakened in the lane. AIR WONDERFUL was in the four path through the first turn, moved to the rail through the far turn and never was a factor. MANO
 FOX set the early pace while in the two path, was passed along the inside on the backstretch, kept in close contention into the far turn then was done near
 the five-sixteenths pole.
