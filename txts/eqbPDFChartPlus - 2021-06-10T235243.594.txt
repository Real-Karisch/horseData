 Footnotes
 STORMY MEMO tracked leader to far turn, took over past the five sixteenth pole and drove clear in the lane under steady handling. ALEXANDRA
 THIRTEEN never far back, rallied through the stretch and held the place spot gamely. KITTEN'S PEEBLES unhurried early, one paced from inside in the
 stretch missed to just miss the place spot, NO VA MAS bothered at the start, loped along off leaders, put to a hard drive on the turn but came up empty in
 the stretch. SHEFLEW good speed to set pace for three quarters but gave way readily. PATCHWORK KITTEN showed little.

 Footnotes
 FOUR STAR NINJA sprints up between horses after a staggered start, vied on rail, lost position when steadied slightly, kept on to run past the leader late
 under a heady ride. BECAUSESHECANDOIT had a tardy break, rushed to vie three wide into the turn veering out on the backstretch causing trouble to
 several foes in the process, shook free and stayed on the wrong lead from the quarter pole, could not go on and was run down in the final sixteenth.
 WHATSYOURSIGN tried to keep up on the rail to the stretch but ran for the show spot outside late. OUR MARIKKA off slow and bothered on the
 backstretch, rushed up four wide out of turn, headed leader but came up empty when needed. LANTANA MOLL showed good speed between horses into
 turn but faded back. DISCREESITA swerved out sharply with a terrible start, went up outside on the turn while far back. DIAMONDS FOR JIM forced out
 sharply on the backstretch by BECAUSESHECANDOIT and never recovered.
