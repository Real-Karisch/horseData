 the inside, angled three wide leaving the turn, remained on same path through the stretch and was along for the show. TODOS SANTOS forced the pace
 into and on the turn while outside leader, drifted out four wide entering the stretch, continued well off the fence and lost the show late. SEAQUET settled
 early, crossed over past half mile marker, later found the fence on the turn, came back out some into the lane and was no late threat. SAPODILLA
 prominent early from the outside, continued close up while three wide on the turn, was fanned five wide into the lane, remained well off the fence and failed

 TIZWAY THAT WAY set pressured pace from the inside, retained control while slightly off rail leaving last turn then shook free under urging and proved best
 under steady handling late. BACKINTHEACADEMY between foes early then tracked leader from along the rail, came out bit in the stretch and lasted for the
 place. RYDER'S STARLIGHT reserved from off the rail, outside rival chasing the pace, continued two then three wide into the lane, closed some late and
 just missed the place while outside runner-up. SHESWILDNFREE reserved from the inside, continued along the rail, made up some ground around second
 turn but failed to sustain effort in the lane. JILL MADDEN three wide early, briefly contested the pace then forced the issue outside winner, remained off the
 rail then was under asking to remain close entering the stretch, lost contact, came in some in mid stretch and weakened.
