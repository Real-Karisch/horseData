 under coaxing five-sixteenths out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat holding stubbornly to the front, got nailed in the final stride to
 the wire in a good effort. BARRIER TO ENTRY prompted the pace from the three path in hand until set down spinning two to three wide for home, dug in
 under a drive latched on the aforementioned foe through the length of the stretch looming and could not go by. ESTHER THE QUEEN just off the inside
 between foes in close aim of the front, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive bidding mildly to the eighth pole, flattened out
 in the late stages. MISS AJA BROWN bobbled at the break, chased three wide, raced between foes through the turn, got roused spinning four wide at the
 quarter pole and made no headway. SILLY FACTOR four wide in pursuit, advanced mildly to stack outside a trio three furlongs from home when put to
 coaxing, continued four wide at the head of the stretch and weakened in the drive.

 Footnotes
 MOONDANCE JOY off the inside throughout, pursued the front runners from the four path on the turn, picked up interest closing the gap beginning from the
 three-eighths pole, got cued up to challenge in earnest heading into the stretch, emerged at the eighth pole as the new leader and with none latched on,
 held sway under good handling. CHAMPAGNE RUBY was off a length the slowest, cut over to the rail well before reaching the conclusion of the
 backstretch, took the inside route for the opening half, got fanned out into path six heading for the three-sixteenths marker, becoming the widest of all, had a
 good finish down the center of the strip to garner the place. NON FINISCE MAI out-broke the field and retained the advantage, was forced to fend off
 BILEAPS AND BOUNDS to the outside, out in path three though, was in the process of putting away that opponent when pounced upon by the winner,
 relinquished before arriving at the furlong grounds then weakened into the show slot. E WARFARE saved ground for the initial half, was asked for run
 angling out for the stretch run and got outfinished. VICKI'S DANCER settled into the two path proceeding along the backstretch, chased the ongoing pace
 dispute, but without benefit of cover from either of the combatants a short distance up ahead, tipped out as the half was being completed in preparation for
 the stretch drive, spun four wide into the lane, wasn't making any headway when taken in hand being pinched with approximately a sixteenth remaining.
 BILEAPS AND BOUNDS sparred for control three wide for a half before giving way.

 Footnotes
 TRUE LOVE IS YARE cut the pace from the two path in hand through sensible splits, tucked to the hedge half a mile from home, came under coaxing
 nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came under threat a furlong out, dug in under a drive and held on gamely to prevail.
 TIME TO FLIRT four wide near the rear, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
 inside the final furlong, came in under an off sided stick nearing the sixteenth marker to look the leader in the eye and tightened up the seam for JONQUIL
 between foes forcing that rival to briefly pause and steady lightly, dug in head to head to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed at the wire. JONQUIL three
 wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth,
 had the aforementioned rival come inwards and was placed now between foes nearing the sixteenth marker, got pinched out and was forced to pause and
 briefly steady at that station, then continued on for the show honors. MORE THAN A LEGEND three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing five-sixteenths
 from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick for the last major share. HOLIDAY HOPES just off the pace just off the
 inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. FRENCH DRESSING steadied at the start in tight between foes, chased three
 wide from mid pack, got set down continuing three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. EMERALD QUALITY four wide in pursuit under coaxing
 from three furlongs out, weakened in the stretch. VEIL saved ground in mid pack, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper
 stretch and tired. RANSOM KITTY forwardly placed three then two wide attending the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, retreated through
 the latter portion of the turn and faltered.

 Footnotes
 NEVISIAN SKY remained along the inside route after an apparent clean getaway, tracked the front runners while being rated along, slipped out into path
 three coming to the five-sixteenths pole, was forced to stay on hold and idle behind a wall of opponents beginning from a few jumps shy of the quarter pole,
 angled about four wide into the lane, angled once more, this time into path five and in the direction of a developing hole between rivals in the vicinity of the
 three-sixteenths marker, split foes and then shot to the top striking the furlong marker, shifted back towards the inside after having built up a solid lead,
 extended it, completing the final seventy yards only mildly asked. FREEDOM SEVEN settled into the two path after the break, stalked a foursome of front
 runners from the top of the bend to its end, got cued then sent outward into path six from upper to midstretch, was about to claim the top, but got beaten to
 the punch by the winner, proved no match in the final furlong, while finishing comfortably clear of the rest for place honors. RIVER KNIGHT migrated over to
 the hedge after the start, was in possession of a slight lead getting hounded by a trio of foes, parked out in paths two through four respectively, got turned
 loose for the drive home, was overhauled by the top twosome with a bit over an eighth to go, had enough left at the end to salvage the show. BOOKEW
 BUCKS in the four path, disputed the pace as the widest of a quartet until the vicinity of the eighth pole, missed out on third. ANIMAL POSSE in the two
 path, vied for command from between foes until past the three-sixteenths marker and gave in. JO'S BOLD CAT sat within range in the two path within range
 of a four-way scuffle for command, was forced to remain on hold stymied behind a wall of rivals from late on the bend to midstretch, checked off heels then
 altered course to the outside, failed to generate any interest. ONE EYED RAY was quickly placed along the hedge, went on to save ground to avail.
 CODY'S NOTES raced sluggishly down the backstretch, departed the backstretch from the two path, fanned out into path seven from upper to midstretch,
 had no rally. MANIFEST DESTINY set up in the three path in the shadow of the starting gate, pressed the issue as one of the middle members of a gang of
 four, both down the backstretch and during the run around the bend, kept up the bid until upper stretch before giving way.

 Footnotes
 FAYEQ four wide in range of the leader, advanced to vie three wide outside a pair through the turn taking over command with five-sixteenths to go, swung
 three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive kept to task. UNCLE MOJO chased the pace along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper
 stretch, had CLEAR N CONVINCING drift directly in front and quickly altered over that foe's heels to the two path at the three-sixteenths, offered up a mild
 kick to secure the place honors. BROOKLYN BOBBY just off the inside at the rear of the field, came under coaxing angled three wide at the five-sixteenths,
 continued outwards to swing five wide at the head of the stretch, ran on through the drive to be along for the show honors. YOUR SECRET'S SAFE four
 then three wide in pursuit, got put to encouragement at the five-sixteenths, cornered four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. ROUGH SEA
 chased four to five wide coming under a ride at the three-eighths, swung five wide at the quarter pole, offered no response. CLEAR N CONVINCING
 showed the way from the two path early on before being confronted by a pair into the turn, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing nearing
 the five-sixteenths and was headed for command, spun just off the inside for home, drifted in when weakening at the three-sixteenths forcing UNCLE MOJO
 to alter to the two path and weakened through to the finish. WINNING ELEMENT broke in at the start, chased three wide in aim of the leader before ranging
 up to vie between foes through the turn now tucked to the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired.

 Footnotes
 BLACK TIDE was pulling on the bit right from the get-go, spurted away from the competition while racing at or near the two path on the backstretch, left the
 half mile pole in possession of his largest advantage, lost half of during the run around the bend, was in the vicintiy of the three-sixteenths marker before
 getting switched over to a drive, drifted out a bit in the final stages but reached the wire in time to prevail. STARTUP NATION sat unhurried in the two path,
 participating as a member of the herd giving chase on the loose leader during the initial half, cut into the deficit travelling on the turn, fanned out into path
 seven from upper to midstretch, flashed a belated kick, but fell short. RAPT rode the hedge for six furlongs, got angled out into two path while being given
 his cue at the commencement of the stretch drive, checked while in tight between rivals in midstretch, got going again under some encouragement soon
 afterwards, appeared hesitant to split rivals a sixteenth later, was well into the final seventy yards before finally doing so, then rallied for the show. CLOUD
 CONTROL took up the chase from the two path, got sent out into path eight from upper to deep stretch, mustered up a mild kick throughout that venture to
 secure the last major check. BRIMSTONE stalked the runaway pacesetter from the two path in the early stages and came up empty. MEMORIES OF
 PETER raced two wide in midpack, was asked to pick it up at the five-sixteenths pole, failed to do so appreciably. DOT MATRIX loosely pocketed, faltered.
 ORINO three wide at the top of the bend, was four wide at the head of the stretch, failed to menace. UNCLE SIGH three wide entering the turn, wandered
 out into path nine after exiting it. UNO EMAYO three wide departing the backstretch, gave way. ROOFTOP VIEW took the inside route for six furlongs,
 swung four wide into the stretch in hand and proceeded towards the finish line still in hand.

 Footnotes
 CHALON chased three then two wide through the turn advancing to issue a challenge to the leader midway on the bend, took over command with
 five-sixteenths to go, floated four wide into upper stretch put to encouragement, drew clear under a drive and was kept to task. GOLDEN MISCHIEF four
 then three wide chasing forwardly placed early on, remained in hand and gradually lost position through the turn, came under urging at the five-sixteenths,
 angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along to secure the place honors. SADIE BE GOOD chased three wide under
 coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages, then was pulled up after the finish and
 subsequently vanned off. YORKIEPOO PRINCESS chased the pace along the inside, got set down angled three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
 drive. PRETTY CITY DANCER just off the inside at the tail of the field initially, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, angled out six wide into upper
 stretch, weakened in the lane. CAJUN DELTA DAWN cut the pace in hand just off the inside until tucked to the rail with seven-sixteenths to go, came under
 a ride at the three-eighths coming under challenge from the eventual winner, got displaced five-sixteenths from home, cornered just off the inside at the
 head of the stretch and tired. VERTICAL OAK tossed her head to the near side and hit the gate at the start while very briefly in one hand of the assistant
 starter as her head was turned into the near side of the stall, hopped out of the gate well behind and was pulled up. There was a Stewards' inquiry into the
 start focusing on VERTICAL OAK. As a result VERTICAL OAK was declared a non starter having been deemed to have been compromised at the start.

 Footnotes
 OUTRAGEOUS BET inched his way into the two path proceeding down the backstretch, picked it up when put to a drive leaving the midway point on the
 turn, hitched up to the leader and bid in earnest stepping into the lane, went at it in a spirited tussle with the second place finisher before kicking clear in the
 final sixteenth. COLONEL ANDY sprinted off from the competiton, showed the way from the inside, came under attack from a fully revved-up
 OUTRAGEOUS BET as they made their way into the lane, with PSYCHIC ENERGY also briefly lurking a danger at that stage tooo, saw the nemesis poke a
 head in front by the start of the last eighth, put up a fight for another sixteenth then backed away. OH SO SINISTER two wide entering the turn, swung three
 to four wide exiting it, stitched together a stretch run good enough to rally for the show. PSYCHIC ENERGY took up the chase mostly three wide on the turn,
 unleashed an abbreviated challenge heading into the lane, failed to keep pace with the first two finishers then lost out late for the show. SOURCE
 CONTROL two wide at the commencement of the run around the bend, fanned out into path six during the initial portion of the stretch, lacked the needed
 late response. BROOKLYN SPEIGHTS departed the backstreth from the three path, came six wide into the lane and had no offering. DUBLIN
 LEPRECHAUN had the pilot take hold in the shadow of the gate, eluding another in close proximity, was two wide heading for the conclusion of the
 backstretch, got maneuvered into path five from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths pole, then got sent out into path seven from upper to
 midstretch, made no headway. LEGENDARY HUMOR saved ground, was checked while in tight midway on the turn, never made its presence felt.
 BENEFICIAL RISK in the three path at the top of the turn, wandered out down the lane until eight wide while never posing a threat. ACT SURPRISED
 guided into the pocket at the half mile pole, faltered.
