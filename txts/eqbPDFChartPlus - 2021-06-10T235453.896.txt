 held sway. DELAWARE BASIN stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, made a bid entering the drive but could not
 reach the winner. NAUGHTY MOON dueled from the inside early, fought up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn but could not keep
 pace in the drive. KID CORREA forced the early pace from the inside, remained forward but came up empty in the drive. HANSEN'S HOLIDAY chased the
 early pace outside but had nothing left. ANDY MAN was never close. SCRUTINY showed little.

 Footnotes
 RUN ROCKET well placed from the inside, chased the pace up the backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, responded entering the drive, split
 rivals upper stretch and steadily drew clear. KING ZIPPY stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering
 the drive and was along for the place. WRECK EM pressed the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded and was just
 up for the show. TWO DATE unhurried early from the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded but was too late. GUITAR KING was never a
 factor. QUISTY BOY was never a threat. DONNA'S COURT dueled from the outside and tired. CHASE FOR THE GOLD dueled from the inside and faded.
