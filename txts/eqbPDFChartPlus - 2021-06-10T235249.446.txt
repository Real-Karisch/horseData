 Footnotes
 BIBLICAL STRENGTH away in good order, dueled early toward the inside, shook clear while in hand turn, enough left in the late going to prove best. WHOZ
 TALKIN NOW void of early foot, advanced along the inside late in the turn, moved out a bit when set down for the drive, finished up willingly to be getting to
 the winner late. DREWSIZZLE off a step slow, dropped inside when trailing, also improved while saving ground turn, flattened out a bit in the drive to prove
 no match for the top two. NORTH HULLEN in the second flight while racing outside, lacked a late punch. SPARKY SPARKLES closest to the dueling
 leaders early, tired while four wide out of the turn. OUR RAPIDASH dueled early outside the winner after an alert break, gave way. STIHL HARBOR in the
 main body early, fell back into the turn, trailed home.

 Footnotes
 TOOMUCH within striking distance for a half toward the inside, advanced and lodged a rail bid turning for home, drove steadily clear through the lane.
 DANCE TILL TWO forwardly placed on the outside early, raced four wide into the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, edged clear for the
 place. SHARP HENNY vied early while between rivals, chased the leader through the turn, also proved no match for the winner, weakened late to be caught
 for the place. WILD APPOINTMENT void of speed, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position slightly. VANISHING IMAGE last away,
 trailed early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. YES BABE narrowly set the early pace, briefly shook clear in the turn in the two
 path, allowed the winner the inside turning into the stretch, gave way when headed by that rival. SCHUYLER SISTER forward early while racing three wide,
 began a steady retreat before a half.

 Footnotes
 MY BUDDY CHUCK closest to the leader early while off the inside, challenged between rivals entering the stretch, long drive, gained the nod at the wire. U
 S OFFICER raced off the early pace, moved out late turn, angled out and challenged on the outside entering the stretch, dueled with the winner to the wire,
 missed the nod. HE'S A LADY TAMER sprinted clear out of the chute, garnered a larger advantage through the turn, briefly responded when confronted by
 the top two exiting the turn, could not keep up with that pair while weakening, saved the show. AMEROCKO off the early pace, was floated out five wide
 turning for home, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a late kick. MY EXPECTATIONS forwardly placed for a half, faded while racing three out to four
 wide late in the turn. FAST TIME STREAKER remained always back. BLUE FORTY TWO was also never a factor.

 AFRO BLUE broke on top, set all the pace, drew out steadily through the lane while being kept to task. SUNDAY'S MISTAKE forwardly placed, chased the
 winner into and through upper stretch, proved no match in the final furlong, all out to hold the place. TEE'S BLACK IRISH settled off the pace, improved
 while saving ground into the straight, continued willingly to the finish to be steadily getting to the runner up. C'MON VE closest to the winner for three
 furlongs off the inside, gradually weakened. BENTONVILLE bothered at the start, remained back. KISS OF THE WOLF broke out, was always outrun.
 VIVINSKY raced in mid pack outside, got out turning for home, lugged in upper stretch, backed up the final furlong.

 Footnotes
 DR. ZIPCITY with the pace while closest to the inside, helped set a soft set of early fractions, narrowly showed the way into the lane, rebroke and drew well
 clear the final furlong. ALPHA BRAVO allowed the pace to go early, swept up to challenge four wide turning into the stretch, proved no match for the winner,
 clearly second best. DEWEY'S SUNSHINE forwardly placed when forcing the issue early, chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch, little left for the
 drive, finished up best orf the rest. CALLITWHATYAWANT settled off the pace while racing toward the inside, came up empty for the drive. ON THE TAKE
 vied up front early, dueled in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn outside the winner, weakened in the drive. DONTTAKEITPERSONAL broke out,
 lacked early foot, moved a bit closer early backstretch, flattened out in the drive.

 Footnotes
 JOEY G with the pace from the start toward the inside, was racing in traffic late in the turn when she came in to tighten up SWEET ROSEBUD and soundly
 bumping that rival, got out a bit into the straight, shook clear nearing the furlong marker then held FANCY MALLORY safe in the late going under firm
 handling. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN OUT OF THE TURN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF SWEET
 ROSEBUD AGAINST JOEY G FOR INTERFERENCE EXITING THE TURN, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH. FANCY
 MALLORY forwardly placed in the second flight outside, moved a bit closer four wide late in the turn, lost some ground to the winner into the lane, slowly
 getting back to that one late. ALLSTAR SUPERSTAR vied up front while racing three wide, weakened in the drive, finished up best of the rest. SWEET
 ROSEBUD in the second flight inside, moved closer late in the turn when pinched by JOEY G. checked up when bumped by that same rival, finished evenly
 after recovering in the drive. WIND ZEE went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. BANKERS HONOUR broke slowly, raced back for three
 furlongs, improved position in the late going while not a serious threat. HIGH HOPES DANCE off a step slow, trailed early, also improved a bit in the drive.
 JOLIE GEE was finished early. CASEY'S DOLL settled back off the pace, lacked a response in the drive. GRASSHOPPING JULIE vied up front between
 horses for three furlongs, stopped in the drive.

 into the lane, slowly getting to the winner late, clear for the place. PARTY TARDE with the pace between rivals and outside the winner up the backstretch,
 fell back a bit in the turn, went evenly in the drive to be unable to contain the runner up, gained the nod for the show on the wire. FASTEN lacked early foot,
 came four wide out of the turn, staged a mild rally to narrowly miss the show. ANITA BONITA vied early on the outside, briefly shook clear midway on the
 turn, faltered in the drive. TONI'S VOW off a bit slow, trailed for a half, improved position in the drive with some belated interest. HONEST SCARLET failed
 to seriously menace. RUNNINGDOWNDREAMS in the second flight early, steadily faded throlugh the lane;. ROMANTIC STROLL in some traffic onto the
 main track, in a bit tight along the rail when racing back exiting the turn, lacked a response when clear for the drive. LAUNCHABIND steadily retreated.

 SUN AND SAND outrun early while racing outside, steadily advanced in the four path late in the final turn, engaged the leader entering the stretch and wore
 that rival down under firm handling. ALEX'S TURN within striking distance off the inside, outside bid in the three path far turn, showed the way into the
 stretch and gave ground grudgingly to the winner. PINCH ASSAULT settled well off the early pace, moved out and followed the winner when moving closer
 four wide turning for home, flattened out a bit the final furlong, held the show. LOGAN'S REWARD last away, trailed for almost six furlongs while well out in
 the strip, found best stride too late in the drive. NEON SKY pressured the pace for five furlongs and had little left for the drive. REAL TIME narrowly set the
 pace along the inside briefly offered resistance to the runner up when that one challenged far turn, weakened gradually in the drive. GUEYDAN forwardly
 placed in the early going, was finished after a half. ROCKIN RUSTY RUE was never involved.

 Footnotes
 POLITICALLYCORRECT outrun early, raced in some traffic when moving closer late in the turn, came four wide into the lane, challenged past the furlong
 marker and drove clear. BOLD STAR with the pace along the inside, showed the way out of the turn and past the furlong marker, briefly raced on equal
 terms with the winner then proved no match late, clearly second best. MR. GIBBS forwardly paced toward the rail, lost some position late in the turn while
 continuing to save ground, came back for the show while not a threat t to the top two late. TOOTH moved closer four wide early in the turn, was floated out
 five wide for the drive, finished up evenly in lacking a late punch. CLASSIC BRAHMS off a step slow, trailed for over a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
 after the issue had been decided. ZACKSGOTTHIS stumbled a few strides after the start, was used to race forwardly paced for five furlongs, weakened in
 the drive while in the three path. DEACON'S HERO broke alertly, showed the way out of the chute, pressed into the turn and then stopped in the drive.
