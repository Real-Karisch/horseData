 Footnotes
 LABYRINTH never far back, closed with a rush six wide through the final furlong and got up in the final strides. BAYSIDER stalked the pace behind rivals in
 the two path, dropped to the rail, lacked racing room in upper stretch, altered course two wide, surged late and just missed. GOD'S WILL BE DONE
 unhurried early, closed willingly five wide through the stretch. LUCKY LEONARD chased the pace into the turn, rallied two wide to make the lead, dropped
 inside, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. DINESEN close up from the start, loomed boldly four wide on the turn then leveled off. CLASSIC
 BUTCH failed to menace. LAS ANA broke slowly and was no threat. DUPLICATOR stalked the pace into the turn, bid three wide then gave way late.
 MINE'S DIALED IN also broke slowly and was no threat. TIZ SMART away alertly, set the pace into the turn and was through after half. STORM OF THE
 NILE also broke slowly and trailed.
