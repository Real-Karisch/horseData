 Footnotes
 SARATOGA MISCHIEF got corrected after starting to move to the right with its second step, was gradually worked to the outside racing along the
 backstretch, departed it from the three path, stalked the leader from between rivals from the three-eighths pole to the end of the bend, was asked for a
 response, as were all others, getting to the quarter pole, idled behind a pair of opponents from upper stretch to the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, was
 steadied getting pinched for one jump at that station, altered course to the inside, responded when given his cue, wearing down the leader in the final
 seventy yards to prove best. DARK AS MIDNIGHT away forwardly placed, got sent into the two path, pressed the issue from between rivals for a good
 portion of the going on the turn, was set down challenging in earnest spinning into the lane, shied out about a path right around the sixteenth pole
 responding as the leader moved outward at that juncture, mustered up some late foot to garner the place. AMERICAN PIONEER grabbed the advantage
 soon after the start, got guided onto the inside, carved out the pace, facing pressure all the while, had it pick up in intensity after halfway around the turn,
 was put to a drive heading for the quarter pole, came out slightly with approximately a sixteenth to go temporararily compromsing the chances of the top
 twosome, held out to inside the sixteenth pole before releasing the top and weakening into the show slot. DISCREET ENCOUNTER pursued the pace four
 wide on the turn, was called upon by the five-sixteenths marker, lacked the necessary stretch response. POLAR JET rode the rail watcing the fornt runners,
 was lightly hand ridden biding time late on the turn, was put to a drive for the drive and came up empty. THE HERO WITHIN parked out five wide on the
 turn, gave way.

 FARCICAL FELINE bumped at the start by GRAND BANKS who broke outwards, attended the pace of PASSING MOMENTS in hand from the three then
 two path patiently handled until put to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside for home, drifted out under a drive a path or so nearing the
 eighth pole before seizing command at that station, dug in under threat through to the finish knocking heads to the wire and prevailed gamely at the finish.
 TIME TO FLIRT just off the pace just off the inside behind the cover of the aforementioned foe, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, cut the
 corner into upper stretch, tipped out to the two path straightened away for home, rallied with a good kick to threaten and duel through the final eighth and
 just missed on the wire. VEIL two to three wide at the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, offered up a
 good finish to close well and secure the show honors in the final jump. LEMONDROP LOLLIPOP three wide in pursuit behind the cover of HOLIDAY
 HOPES, got set down angled four wide at the quarter pole, offered up a mild kick for the last major share. JONQUIL tracked the pace along the inside
 behind the cover of the leader PASSING MOMENTS, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, ran on through the stretch
 but was outkicked. GRAND BANKS broke out at the start bumping FARCICAL FELINE, settled two to three wide near the rear, came under a ride at the
 five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position through to the finish. PASSING MOMENTS established the front and showed the
 way in hand along the inside under some pressure from the presence of FARCICAL FELINE to the outside, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, cut the
 corner into upper stretch under threat, yielded command nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. HOLIDAY HOPES hit the near side stall
 at the start, came under coaxing to be forwardly placed three wide before settling in hand, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, continued three
 wide at the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. GRATIFYING saved ground near the rear, tipped to the two path five-sixteenths from home, angled
 four wide into upper stretch and weakened.

 Footnotes
 SADIE BE GOOD was one of three exchanging a few bumps with each other right after the field had been released by the starter, remained well off the
 inside keeping wtach on BOW TOWN CAT, no doubt influenced by that opponent seemingly heck-bent to get out down the backstretch, stepped onto the
 turn from the four path, gradually moved closer to the rail during the run around the bend as the leader was eventually gotten to the rail herself by the
 quarter pole, coasted to the front at that station, was almost a sixteenth down the road before swtiched over to encouragement, drew off, crossing the wire
 still being asked for run. ANNA RAE traded a few light bumps with TIME SQUARED at the break, pursued the front runners two to three on the turn, fanned
 out into path during the initial portion of the stretch and went on to secure second. TIME SQUARED got checked being squeezed at the start, took up the
 chase from the two path, got maneuvered outward from upper to midlane, was straightened away, by this stage in path six, rallied for the show. PICTURE
 DAY abandoned the inside route to take up position in the two path coming to the end of the backstretch, commenced the stretch three wide, altered course
 into path five in deep stretch, made no headway. MY FAIR LILY at or near the two path to the end of the turn, was urged angling four wide for the stretch
 drive and gave way. BOW TOWN CAT broke slightly to the right after losing its footing springing from the gate, was pulled away from the bumping trio in
 time, gained the advantage in short order, never made it closer to the rail than the three path travelling along the backstretch, displaying a desire to get out
 all the while, had that potential damage countered by a good hold on the left side by the pilot, got moved over nearer and nearer the rail after leaving the
 backstretch though and wound up cutting the corner into the stretch, failed to pick it up when asked soon afterwards, retreated to the rear then was pulled
 up quickly once over the finish line.

 IF YOU SAY SO tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to
 issue a challenge inside the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, then inched away to the finish kept to task. SWIZZLE forwardly placed in the two
 path in hand, advanced to steadily increase the pressure on the leader through the far turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off
 the inside into upper stretch, knocked heads with the leader to take command nearing the eighth pole, shook off that rival confronted by the aforementioned
 foe and was displaced from command a sixteenth out, ran on safe for the place honors. BLENHEIM PALACE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came
 under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to garner the show honors in the final jumps. VIOLET BLUE
 just off the pace two to three wide, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide at the quarter pole, kept on through the stretch but was
 outfinished in the late stages. DOUBLE CAST tossed her head at the start getting away slowly and conceding two to three lengths to the front, settled three
 wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked.
 EMPRESSOF THE NILE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under increasing pressure from SWIZZLE to the
 outside, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in and was headed nearing the eighth pole, weakened in the
 late stages. ANGELS SEVEN (IRE) two to three wide in pursuit, came under a ride with five-sixteenths to go, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered no
 response.

 Footnotes
 FAHAN MURA setlted into midpack after the break, was forced to remain on hold idling behind a wall of opponents beginning from the five-sixteenths
 marker, made it into the stretch still mired in traffic, angled eagerly towards and then through a developing seam out in the vicinity of paths four and five with
 approximately a sixteenth remaining, responded positively when given her cue, took over for good in the final seventy yards and kicked clear. CITY
 SECTION stalked the leader towards the two path, picked up interest as three-quarters was being reached, challenged three wide heading for the top of the
 lane, appeared to poke a head in front in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, proved no match once the winner had the opportunity to get rolling
 herself and wound up being reeled in leaving the sixteenth pole, held on well enough and long enough to salvage second. B THREE sat within range from
 the two path, shifted into path six during the first half of the stretch, mustered up a good late foot, but missed out place honors. POP ROCKS LADY raced or
 near the two path during the opening phases, was sent out eight wide, becoming the widest of all, straightened away and gained ground well to earn the last
 major check. SARATIAGO strung out three wide on the chute, prompted the pacesetter one path closer to the inside thereafter, was set down spinning into
 the lane, remained prominently placed for an additional furlong before backing away. SCARLET GODDESS underwent a three wide journey to the quarter
 pole, issued an abbreviated bid stepping into the stretch then gave way. MADAME BARBARIAN bumped lightly with CAN'TCATCHTHEAXX in the shadow
 of the starting gate, got guided over to the rail before arriving at the end of the chute, left it by getting angled out at the five-sixteenths marker, put together a
 mild kick in the last eighth. LIGHT REIGN lunged inward, hitting the gate, departed the backstretch from the three path and never made it into a contending
 position. JETSAM SIX took up the chase two wide for six furlongs and failed to menace. SASANA (GB) sped to the front settling in by the end of the chute,
 cut over to the inside, cut the pace, succumbed to heavy pressure after going three-quarters and faltered. VALIANT SPIRIT stayed along the inside route
 after the break, rated unkind for the opening six furlongs, fighting with force on the bit, went about on the full turn getting checked at least thrice, got placed
 four wide at the head of the stretch and had no offering. CAN'TCATCHTHERAXX leaned to the right being sent on her way, striking the side of the gate then
 bumped with its next door neighbor, raced mostly two wide on the turn, had no response when asked at the five-sixteenths marker, gave way, was eased
 down the lane and subsequently walked off under its power.

 YOUR LOVE chased two then three wide coming under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch, drifted in straightened
 away a path, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth latching on the leader a sixteenth out, dug in to get up in the final jumps and score. QUIET
 FLIRT broke in at the start bumping SUPER MUFFIN, chased four then three wide through the turn advancing to stack outside the top pair at the
 three-eighths, had SWEET AVERY back away a bit nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive, rallied to take over
 command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat through to the finish and was caught in the final strides while well clear of the rest and second best.
 SWEET AVERY bobbled at the break recovering outwards and bumping with SUPER MUFFIN, chased two to three wide in closest aim of the leader coming
 under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. SUPER
 MUFFIN bumped between foes at the start, cut the pace from the five path down the backstretch before tucking to be just off the inside half a mile from
 home, made her way to the rail midway on the turn coming under pressure from a pair to the outside, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat,
 capitulated the lead at the three-sixteenths and weakened through to the finish. CULPA MIA chased the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the
 three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. FEED ME CARATS coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under urging from midway
 on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BROAD STRIPES three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing half a
 mile from home, swung just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

 ARE WE NOT MEN prompted the pacesetter from the two path, moved when ready coming to the three-eighths pole to take over, was let out spinning into
 the stretch and kicked well clear. SHADOW RIDER took up the chase primarily four wide on the turn, took a shot at the winner turning for home three wide,
 proved no match. OUR CARAVAN got bumped at the start, raced towards the two path to the head of the stretch and went on to rally for the show award.
 READY DANCER three wide into and out of the bend, gave way. PAX IN TERRA broke to the right after losing his footing springing from the gate, was
 bumped in short order, responded to a brisk hand ride afterwards, getting motivated enough to rejoin the others after being as much as two lengths behind
 them all, completed the rest of the trip to the conclusion of the backstretch well reserved, was put to a long hard dirve on the the bend to no avail. BANNER
 BILL stumbled after being bumped from both sides right after the start, was set up in the two path, appeared unsettled wedged in and amongst foes, finally
 getting steadied right around the nine-sixteenths marker, continued along from the two path on the turn, stepped into the stretch and had no rally. LORD
 COMMANDER showed the way from the rail, relinquished without resistance midpoint on the turn and faded.

 Footnotes
 PENJADE (FR) settled three wide near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped
 out to the five path nearing the eighth pole, leaning lightly on SCHEME to open the seam, offered up a good kick to close with a rush outside and just got up
 in the very last jump to prevail. AWESOME SONG stumbled at the start, came under coaxing and showed the way settling in hand along the inside,
 remained patiently handled until nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in fending off a host of challengers stubbornly through the
 drive but was nailed in the last jump to the finish. VAGABOND tracked the pace along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch roused for the drive,
 rallied up the inside offering up good energy to kick on willingly for the show honors. LILLIE'S ANSWER three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing
 five-sixteenths from home, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home, ultimately was repelled, then got
 outfinished in the late going. BELIEVE INDEED just off the inside near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
 stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home, then was outfinished in the late stages. WAR QUEEN (IRE) a bit keen early on under rating by the
 rider, attended the pace from the two path, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. SCHEME three wide in
 pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, angled five wide into upper stretch, got lightly leaned on nearing the eighth pole by
 PENJADE, offered up a mild kick but was outkicked. RIMANISEMPREFORTE just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs
 from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and was outkicked in the drive. BARGAINING TABLE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under a
 ride with five-sixteenths remaining, spun just off the inside for home, offered no response.

 Footnotes
 DOUBLE DOSE took up position in the two path in midpack after the start, was unhurried keeping watch on the front runners, picked up interet catching
 sight of the top of the lane, got sent four wide stepping into it, shifted one path farther off the rail in midstretch, rubbing shoulders with SAME KINDA CRAZY
 as that one was shifting itself out a traffic mess, rallied as a team with the previously-named rival towards the one to catch, grabbed away the advantage in
 the final seventy yards and edged away. FIVE HEARTS took off after some urging from the gate to attain a forward position, tucked into the pocket before
 the start of the run around the bend, slipped off the inside and into path during the going from the five-sixteenths marker to the quarter pole, bid from
 between foes stepping into the stretch and would remain in the middle of others for next furlong, emerged at the eighth pole as the new leader, got collared
 well inside the sixteenth pole, had hust enough left to preserve the place. SAME KINDA CRAZY stayed along the inside route after the start, was forced to
 remain on hold from the five-sixteenths marker, as the second place finisher was shifting to the outside, and then approaching the quarter pole, stuck behind
 the leader with no avenue available to secure more usable options, appeared to have run when forced to check behind rivals deep into the furlong grounds,
 deftly recovered in short order and squeezed her way into path four, brushing lightly with the winner while doing so, rallied in tandem with that opponent until
 the last stages, then fell short of snagging away second. LA NINA pressed the issue two wide, lost its path to the runner up after more than halfway around
 the turn, was given its cue and challenged hard for command outside a pair of opponents from the head of the stretch to midlane before weakening. E
 WARFARE cut over quickly into the two path, wandered out six wide down the lane while making no impact. BARONET three wide and urged on the turn,
 tired. HOLD ON MOMMA marooned along the overland route, failed to respond when put to the whip midway on the turn was never in contention at any
 time. SABRINA BALLERINA showed the way from the rail, vied to the left of two others during the opening half of the stretch run then faltered after being
 replaced on the lead.
