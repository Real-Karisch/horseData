 TREASURE chased inside then a bit off the rail, split horses into the second turn and did not rally. DERBY LADY settled off the rail then angled in and
 saved ground off the pace, went around a rival into thee stretch and lacked a further response. TWINKLE DREAM saved ground stalking the pace, dropped
 back on the second turn and had nothing left for the stretch. OLIGARCHY refused to break and stood in the gate. The stewards conducted an inquiry into
 the start of OLIGARCHY and the stretch run of REDS SACRED APPEAL but made no change when they ruled each of those runners was the cause of her
 own trouble.
