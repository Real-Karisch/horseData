 Footnotes
 BEACH PREMIER hurried away, took pressure through the backstretch from JOYSALITTLERIPPER, edged clear at the quarter pole and won going away.
 LAST FLIGHT away in good order, tracked inside, made move leaving the backstretch but was unable to reach the leader then yielded. DUMONT raced
 four to five into the first turn, was forwardly placed racing five-wide, gained closer order but lacked a closing response that was needed and held for show.
 THIS IS MY NIGHT settled mid pack, gradually advanced into the final turn along the rail but was unable to sustain the bid that was needed.
 JOYSALITTLERIPPER pressed the early pace, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and faded. MY KATHLEEN hopped breaking outward
 leaving the gate, stalked three to four-wide and failed to threaten. IMPULSIVE BUY lacked early speed and faded gradually.

 Footnotes
 SOLON'S WARNING tugged bit while rated on top, responded to pressure from KEY TO GLORY, opened up through the turn, shaken up for drive sealed
 up easy win and was ridden out final sixteenth. WILKO LOVESONG allowed to settle off the pacesetters, dropped back, chased three-wide on the final turn
 but was no match for the winner and held place. STELLA ELLA OLA trailed early and lodged a late bid to earn show. ROADSIDE KISSES unhurried early,
 chased hard leaving the backstretch, raced wide into the lane and closed late. SUNDAY CONFESSIONS lagged early, chased and passed tiring rivals late.
 DANCE MARIAH stalked the pacesetter inside, chased the leader leaving the backstretch and tired. KEY TO GLORY stalked three-wide, moved up to
 closer to challenge the lead and had nothing left in reserved. **DELAY OF POST TIME- due to track maintenance.

 R SUN SAM vied inside for the early lead, gained the lead at the quarter pole, was joined mid stretch by TRIAL BY NITE and prevailed under a drive. TRIAL
 BY NITE was forwardly placed racing three to four-wide through the turn, responded to right-handed urging and lacked final kick to get by. CAVORTING
 LORD hurried away, moved up menacingly racing three-wide late turn and lacked the kick needed. SHEZ WICKED FAST circled into the stretch at the back
 of the pack and closed belatedly. MARIA'S MAGIC raced wide leaving the gate, raced five to six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid.
 BURBANK ROSE broke alertly, steered inward quickly approaching the turn, was joined at the quarter pole and yielded. YEAH I GOT THIS broke slow,
 hustled through the turn along the rail and failed to threaten. READY JAN hustled away, checked hard when path closed abruptly and lacked a bid. JOCKEY
 OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of READY JAN against the rider of R SUN SAM alleging interference away from the gate was not allowed.

 KVOTHE away alertly, rated in close contention, waited for running room through the far turn, shifted out three-wide into the drive, took the lead and won
 going away. CONQUEST HOT HUMOR raced near the back of the pack, driving four-wide at the quarter pole, continued a steady bid getting by late for
 second. CELTIC LAD lagged early, hustled four-wide in the far turn and got up for show. FEISTY FORESTER sat in striking range from the three path,
 pressed the issue leaving the backstretch, gained a narrow advantage late turn and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. CALL IT EVEN lacked early
 speed and showed some mild interest late. KISSIN DANCER showed early speed, prompted the pace from between rivals, lacked a response when asked
 and yielded. HOLLER AT THE MOON sent for speed, felt pressure through the back strait, roused for more into the final turn and stopped.

 SPANISH DIVA broke inward quickly, chased the speed duel and faded gradually through stretch. A FLEETING FEATHER lost ground through the first turn
 and failed to threaten. MISS EASTER was gapped, lodged an all out bid and flattened through drive. SHEENA broke alertly, emerged the leader leaving the
 opening turn but was soon joined by IM EVIN IM LEAVIN, dueled through the backstretch, reached the quarter pole then was unable to move on with the
 eventual winner, was no match for the winner and held on for place. HI DREAMIN was outrun. IM EVIN IM LEAVIN vied outside for the lead, drifted outward
 leaving the opening turn, moved up to contest the pace, dueled outside of SHEENA, disposed of rival at the quarter pole, opened up through the final turn
 and was geared down mid stretch to win easily. ANGELS N HEAVEN hustled away, dropped back, closed the gap leaving the far turn, gained then evened
 out. RONI ROCKET lacked early speed and never reached contention. TIMER MALFUNCTION- no fraction available for the five eighths fraction due to
 timer malfunction.

 KIRWAN'S MOUNTAIN hurried inside, allowed to settle on the rail and retreated. FLASH THE CASH was reserved early, drove four-wide on the final turn,
 was gaining on the leader but lacked the final kick to get by. A GUY CALLED SUE was brushed leaving, raced at the back of the pack, gained closer order
 in the final turn, continued with a steady bid to earn show honors. WEST OF SABINAL broke inward leaving, shied from tracks leaving the chute, secured a
 inside position, showed the way through the backstretch, reached the top of the stretch and was overwhelmed. DOC ROSS never reached contention.
 WILLY BE SMART raced in closest pursuit, closed the gap on the leader and failed to kick on. MOMTHINKSIMCUTE advanced quickly through the
 backstretch, gained closer order along the rail, found running room into the stretch and won under steady pressure. MAXIMUS PRIME raced four-wide on
 the opening turn and failed to respond.

 SIBERIAN BEAR hustled up, found seam leaving the opening turn, set a pressured pace inside, gained a the lead at the quarter pole, was showing signs of
 tiring, was kept under right-handed urging and held on. DUDLEY DO lacked early speed, was reserved off the pacesetters, advanced along rail, was gaining
 on the leader through the drive, angled out mid stretch and missed. RED RIVER BEAR raced four-wide into the opening turn, chased the pacesetters
 leaving the backstretch, rallied between rivals into the lane, roused for more and flattened. VISIONS OF JOY quickly went to the front, contended the pace
 from between rivals, was unable to match strides with the eventual winner and yielded at the top of the stretch. CUSTOM ZIP was bumped and checked in
 the first turn, trailed and showed some interest late. JUST SHOW ME was brushed entering the backstretch, chased and failed to threaten. CUZZIN BUZZ
 pressed the pace from the three path, was unable to move on with rivals and wilted abruptly. AMERISCAPE unhurried and was done early.

 Footnotes
 SPEEDMEISTER trailed the field, raced widest through the backstretch, rallied four-wide through the far turn, gained the lead into the stretch and kicked
 away. MOON KING tracked inside, lacked running room leaving the backstretch, found seam upper stretch and rallied late to earn place. MR. KALYPSO
 raced three to four-wide into the first turn, stalked three to four-wide and lacked rally needed. PRIVATE MONEY GAME lost ground in the first turn,
 advanced along the rail, waited into the stretch, angled out to the four path mid stretch and yielded. BLUE DANCER showed the way into the backstretch,
 was overtaken late turn and retreated. THE ALL BUTTON rated just off the pace, was overwhelmed into the final turn and faltered. STORMCHASER
 tracked three-wide and dropped back. GEM ALTA sat in range and faded gradually.
