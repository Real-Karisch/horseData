 JERICHO set a pressured pace while sticking on the rail, shook clear when asked for more, won driving. LANDING GEAR chased the pace between horses
 going two and three wide around the turns but was no match for the winner. RETRACTABLE stumbled at the break then sat well rated on the inside, was
 able to pass tired rivals down the lane. FORT COMMANDER chased the pace on the inside, vied for the lead at the five sixteenths briefly going two wide but
 retreated from there. KING OF THE SCORE lunged at the break but went up and chased the pace on the outside, went around the turns in the three path
 but had no response and was eased down the lane. FORGOT TO FORGET vied for the lead going two wide around the turns, ran eagerly in the early going
 but was spent for the drive.

 Footnotes
 SEPTEMBER SURPRISE was sent to the lead inside, saved ground while dueling inside of IT'S SPRINGTIME on the turn, shook her off and took command
 into the lane, and held well safe. STURN DONNA broke awkwardly and was bumped by SHES JUST CAPITAL in the opening strides, settled two wide, was
 pushed along on the turn but slow to respond, swung out four wide into the lane, found her best near the three eighths, could not threaten the leader but
 was best of the rest. DISRESPECTFUL chased the pace in the three path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, and ran on mildly along the rail. IT'S
 SPRINGTIME broke sharply and was sent to press outside SEPTEMBER SURPRISE, dueled outside of that foe around the far turn, but was put away into
 the lane and weakened. DANCE LIKE KATIE hit the gate, tracked the pace inside, was pushed along from the seven sixteenths mark, came three wide into
 the stretch in striking range, but offered no bid in the lane. PRADA STORM settled near the rear three wide, raced in the three to four paths on the turn while
 still at the rear, came five wide into the stretch, and ran only evenly in the lane. SHES JUST CAPITAL broke outward bumping STURN DONNA in the
 opening strides, settled inside, saved ground through the turn but did not rally. NO SMOKIN HERE tracked the early pace two wide,was pushed along inside
 near the three eighths, came two wide into the lane, proved empty, and was eased.

 Footnotes
 BLUE SKY KOWBOY settled at the rear, eased a bit forward two wide into the backstretch, remained in last even when RIVER EVANGELIST to his inside
 began to edge forward, brought up the rear in the two path into the stretch while still in close range of the rest of the pack, rallied along the rail, split horses
 near the sixteenth to take the lead, and kicked clear under a mild drive. GAIN GROUND stalked the pace inside, tugged keenly into the backstretch and
 moved to stalk outside ROMEO O ROMEO into the backstretch, stalked two wide from there and into the far turn, nosed to the lead near the five sixteenths
 mark and dueled outside ROMEO O ROMEO from there, could not contain the winner but ran on well to the wire. PATRIOT DRIVE tracked the pace while
 saving ground through both turns, came off the rail for room in the lane, and finished with good energy. ROMEO O ROMEO hit the gate and was then
 bumped by HIGH ON SUGAR in the opening strides, sent to the front, was confronted by GAIN GROUND to his outside on the far turn and dueled inside
 him from the five sixteenths, fought with that foe to the sixteenth pole but weakened late. RIVER EVANGELIST came out of the gate slowly and settled near
 the rear, took closer order with the field while running a little rank into the far turn, made a mild advance between horses from the three eighths mark, but
 flattened in the lane. HIGH ON SUGAR broke inward and bumped ROMEO O ROMEO in the opening strides, stalked the early pace two wide, settled to
 track the pace down the backstretch, advanced again to stalk three wide on the far turn and into the stretch, but came up empty in the final furlong. HART
 HILLS ROAD tracked the pace two wide on the clubhouse turn and the backstretch, tracked four wide through the second turn, and offered no bid.

 Footnotes
 GREELEY'S SPECIAL was taken up at the three quarters pole and had no room to run for much of the race, stalked the pace going two wide around the
 turn, circled the field at the quarter pole and drew off from there. SUMMER DISCO stalked the pace going three wide around the turn, ran all out through the
 stretch but it was not enough. COSTLY KING tracked the pace on the outside, went three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. MENDOTA tracked the
 pace while going two wide around the turn then had no rally. SPECIAL CONCOCTION dueled for the lead on the outside going two wide around the turn
 then faded for the drive. MR. TICKER TALKER bobbled at the break then trailed the field, went four wide around the turn and was able to pass tired rivals.
 GOOD SAMURAI chased the pace going two wide around the turn then weakened for the drive. BRAVE BENNY dueled for the lead on the inside, was
 spent for the drive at the quarter pole and was eased down the lane.

 Footnotes
 WILDWOOD SCAT stalked the pace two wide, gained position on the runaway leader around the far turn and engaged her two wide into the lane, got her
 head in front near the sixteenth pole, and held off the closing rally of SING ONE SONG to her inside. The latter settled two wide near the rear early, began
 to make improvement two wide into the far turn, sustained her rally into the stretch, split horses near the three sixteenths, rallied between another pair inside
 the sixteenth pole, continued to advance gamely but just missed catching the winner. SACRED CANYON tracked the pace, continued tracking in the three
 path on the far turn while taking closer order, came into the stretch in the four path, finished with interest to the wire but was outfinished. TINDERELLA was
 hustled from the outside gate to a clear lead inside, dictated terms in the two path through both turns, saw her lead diminish as the field approached the
 stretch, was caught near the sixteenth mark and weakened from there. BREWMISTRESS stalked the pace while saving ground through both turns, but
 flattened out in the lane. SUNSET GABLES settled near the rear while saving ground through the first turn, was two wide near the rear though the second
 turn, and offered no rally. SARK LADY broke outward hitting the gate, settled two wide at the rear, was three wide while still near the rear at the quarter
 pole, and never proved a threat. CHICA BONITA tossed her head at the break, settled near the rear while saving ground, and did not muster a bid.
 MISSION STORM hit the gate while bobbling at the start, tracked the pace two wide on the first turn, chased while saving ground through the far turn, and
 was empty in the lane.

 RICHIESINTHEHOUSE had a clear lead from the start and stayed towards the inside, drew off with ease. PRAIRIE REBEL was allowed to settle off the
 pace while on the outside, went three and four wide around the turn, was full of run at the three eighths pole and kept the momentum going into the stretch
 but it was not enough. R FAST LIFE bumped at the break with G. C. CRACKERJACk then trailed the field, saved ground around most of the turn but was
 forced to swing five wide into the stretch where he uncorked a rally. PRESIDENT ELECT got bumped at the break by RICHIESGOTSWAGGER then was
 allowed to settle between horses, went two wide around most of the turn then swung five with into the stretch, ran all out through the finish. HARLANDAY
 was allowed to settle off the pace while on the inside, swung into the stretch in the three path where he uncorked a late outside rally with a furlong to go.
 ROCK CAN TOUR sat well rated off the pace, went two wide around the turn and grew tired. G. C. CRACKERJACK bumped at the break with R FAST LIFE
 but quickly shook it off, went three and four wide around the turn while tracking the pace but weakened for the drive. LITTLE IKE lugged in at the break and
 bumped into RICHIESGOTSWAGGER in the process, went up and chased the pace on the inside but retreated for the drive. JEFF THE LION was reluctant
 to load but broke well, settled off the pace running between horses going three wide around the turn but had no response when asked for more.
 RICHIESGOTSWAGGER was fractious in the gate then got squeezed at the break, chased the pace going two wide around the turn but had no response
 when asked for more.

 Footnotes
 NORTHERN ALLIANCE stalked the pace while saving ground, gained on the leader while still saving ground around the second turn, angled outside the
 leader past the quarter pole, led approaching the furlong pole, and edged clear. ODACHI was bumped by KARA'S ANGEL in the opening strides,
 nonetheless sent to the lead, was headstrong while still dictating clear terms into the backstretch, continued to set the pace in the two path on the far turn as
 NORTHERN ALLIANCE drew closer, was engaged by that foe to his outside past the quarter pole, and continued on gamely even after being headed
 approaching the furlong pole. STAR OF THE MARKET tracked the pace inside on the first turn and the backstretch, saved ground until the turn for home,
 came three wide into the lane, could not catch the top two but ran on with continued interest to the wire. DEVIL'S ROSE chased the early pace two wide,
 chased three to four wide through the far turn, and rallied three wide in the final furlong. REAL DE JALPA tracked the pace two wide and ran evenly in the
 lane. IMAGE OF LUCY chased the pace while saving ground, made some improvement on the far turn and into the lane, but flattened out in the final
 sixteenth. HOLY COOKIE was fractious in the gate and came slowly into stride, settled to trail, raced in the four and five paths on the far turn, and passed
 tiring horses. FOR MY MOM broke awkwardly and stumbled badly in the opening strides, settled two wide near the rear early, saved ground through the far
 turn, and did not offer a bid. ROAD TO ZANZIBAR settled near the rear, raced in the four path on the far turn, and did not rally. KARA'S ANGEL broke
 inward and bumped ODACHI in the opening strides, stalked the pace two wide on the first turn, tracked two wide on the backstretch and into the far turn,
 stopped near the three eighths marker, was eased in the lane, completed the course while pulling up, and walked off the course under her own power.

 Footnotes
 IOYA AGAIN bobbled at the break then went up and tracked the pace on the inside, went two and three wide into the stretch with an outside rally down the
 lane, edged clear in time to win. HOUSE OF CORTEZ chased the pace going two wide around the turns, finished gamely between horses. Z U SOON had a
 comfortable lead most of the way, dug in when asked for more but it was not enough. CROWN REGENT sat well rated off the pace while on the inside,
 stayed on the rail the whole way but his hole closed in at the eighth pole so he angled out and rallied from there. YOU SPLIT TENS got jostled around a bit
 as they entered the first turn, he sat well rated off the pace while going two wide around the turns, hit his best stride with a sixteenth to go. HERE COMES
 KYLE was rank going around the first turn while going two wide, got on the rail turning for home and ran all out on the inside. NEXT MONDAY sat well rated
 off the pace while on the inside then finished evenly. BEHIND ENEMY LINES was sluggish leaving the gate then got jostled around into the first turn, ran
 towards the rear going two wide around the turns but had no response. ANDREW THE GIANT was rank in the early going while running towards the rear,
 had no rally. THE KAHN sat well rated off the pace while going two and three wide around the turns, faded for the drive. DR. BOMBAY bobbled at the break
 then got jostled around as the field entered the first turn, went two and three wide around both bends but was never a threat.
