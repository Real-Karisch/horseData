 KNUCKLE BALL set a pressured pace to the turn, drew clear and held safely while kept to task. SPARKY WHO raced close to the pace inside, eased out
 for the drive, couldn't gain ground and finished second best. LIL STORMY ROMANCE was fractious in the gate, bumped at the start, lacked a rally and
 settled for show. GOLDEN CADET showed speed to the turn and gave way. FREEZE EM'S ROAD was fractious in the paddock, ducked in at the start, fell
 far back and passed a tiring rival. JAZZMONT broke out and bumped at the start, pressed two across to the turn, stopped, swung wide and dropped back.

 Footnotes
 LAURAS INDIANMUSIC settled into stride, switched off the inside at the three-quarter pole, moved between foes past the five-eighths and pressed the pace
 up the backstretch, took the lead outside the three-eighths, put to a drive on the far turn and drew off under steady handling. LAKEN'S DIAMOND was urged
 at the break, chased the pacesetter three to four wide early, dropped back and shifted in up the backstretch, came out into the stretch and got up for second
 late. TRACTOR MAN was in pursuit four to five wide in the early going, shifted in leaving the backstretch to continue chasing two to three wide between foes
 on the far turn, came into the stretch four deep and failed to rally. STREET TOWER set the pace inside, faced pressure up the backstretch, gave way.
 SHOW CAN TELL was reluctant to load, shifted in heading down the stretch the first turn, came out leaving the first turn, improved position. STORMIN
 CORE was within range of the leaders going three to four wide, dropped back on the turn and faded in the lane. COMIC'S SONG shifted in entering the run
 up the backstretch and failed to rally.

 ATTILA'S APOLLO got away alertly, content to track initially from off the inside, took over and drew off while keeping to task in the lane. MAGGIE GOT
 MARRIED chased the pace inside rivals but off the fence roughly in the two to three path, fought on for second over MISS JAZZY, who stalked from outside,
 moved three to four wide on the turn, was outkicked for the place. FLYING GOLD, urged at the break, showed brief speed, weakened. MIA PIXIE failed to
 threaten while coming into upper stretch four to five wide. WILD IRISH ROSE tired.

 PROUD OF MARIA set the pace racing just off the rail, drifted a bit entering the stretch and through the stretch but still drew off under a drive. MISSING
 GROOM pursued the winner from outside, was no match for that one but maintained the place. EL NEGRO CABALLERO raced off the leader three to four
 wide, got up for show at the wire. STORMIN SAM chased the pace inside, lost show honors. BOURBON BLUE BAYOU trailed.
