 CARLSBAD MOUNTAIN led throughout and held safely while kept to task. BIG TALL PAUL went six wide on the first turn, was never far off the pace while
 racing outside, was roused on the turn, bid five wide and was no match for the winner. UNBRIDLED CANDY chased the pace, had nothing left for the drive
 and held safely for show. SAMENDRA was outrun in an even effort. MOOGIE WOOGIE saved ground, failed to respond and was not a factor. DOGLEG
 LEFT went five wide on the first turn, was through after a half and dropped back steadily. LA SWIFT chased the pace while racing inside, was through after
 a half and stopped.
