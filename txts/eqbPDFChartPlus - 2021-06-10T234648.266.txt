 Footnotes
 OLD CONCH broke alertly, pressured the issue from the outside in the run up the backstretch, challenged three wide through the turn, disposed of the other
 speed nearing the furlong grounds to be clear, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. COPPER CAJUN broke out to slightly bother TOP CAT
 BULLETT, moved outside and raced behind the first flight, four wide through the turn, lost some ground to the winner into the lane, set down for the drive,
 finished willingly to be getting that foe late. UNK'S RED MAN last away, continued to lack speed in trailing for three furlongs, four wide into the lane, finished
 well while remaining out in the strip and while too late. TOP CAT BULLET bothered slightly at the start, quickly recovered to contest the pace, weakened in
 the drive from between horses. I'M FORMIDABLE narrowly set the pace for three furlongs along the inside, also faltered in the drive. MADDY'S
 PRODUCTION lacked speed, six wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally. STORMY INVASION in mid pack for three furlongs, tired in the drive.
 REACHFORME finished early, fell far back, distanced after losing contact with the field.

 Footnotes
 DEBORAH slight bother at the start, settled in mid pack early, continued in traffic up the backstretch, shuffled back into the far turn, moved out, came five
 wide into the stretch, engaged the leader nearing the furlong marker and wore that rival down under firm handling. SKIPADEE DUE DA lacked early speed
 inside, fell further back to trail by daylight the middle half, circled quickly to the fore four wide in the second turn, showed the way past the furlong marker
 and gave ground grudgingly to the winner. FOR GLORYALLELUIA vied early off the inside, fell back steadily after a quarter, steered out when straightened
 for home, came back for the show while not a threat to the top two. IDE BE DYANA within striking distance, also fell back after a half, came four wide into
 the lane, picked off some tiring rivals but did not have enough for the show. CUSTOM FOR CORALES broke out, was straightened to settle off the pace
 inside, continued to save ground backstretch, boxed in along the rail into the far turn, got clear for the drive but managed only an even finish. BAYOU
 QUEEN back off the early pace, lodged a mild middle move into contention in some traffic, faltered in the drive. MISS TOGA set or forced pace, larger lead
 second turn, gave way in the drive.

 CHASIN GRACIE broke out, brushed, with the pace off the inside, dueled through the turn, drove clear through the stretch under steady pressure. LA
 CLEVER back off the pace and the inside, roused three wide turning for home, rallied out in the strip to be up for the place. WOLF'S SONG broke alertly,
 vied up front early between rivals, dueled through the turn inside the winner, could not keep up with that one through the lane, caught late for the place.
 SOUTHSIDE SHORTY brushed at the start, raced back, five wide out of the turn, improved position while remaining out in the strip. BIG TOP SPECIAL
 lacked early foot, went one paced in lacking a late response. RESPECT DUE flashed early foot while between rivals and two off the rail, began to weaken
 into the turn. TIP TO TAIL vied early along the inside, steadied when in tight and shuffled back along the rail into the turn, did not recover. FAST TALKING
 JONES broke slowly, was outrun while racing wide.

 Footnotes
 TENPINS TEMPO broke alertly, got clear soon after, shrugged off a couple of bids in the turn, clear again when straightened for home, drew off as she
 pleased to win ridden out. CHIEF INCA in the second flight along the inside, raced in the two path into the lane, proved no match for the winner, held sway
 for the place. BELLA BE QUICK void of early foot, asked along in the three path turn, came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly to be up for the show,
 slowly getting to the runner up. ALPHA SUE within striking distance while racing outside early, closest to the winner turning for home, came up empty for the
 stretch run. SALUTE MY LADY forwardly placed in the early going, lacked a response. WINEONTHELEVEE last to leave, was never a threat. FLASHY
 ATTITUDE chased the winner early and began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

 Footnotes
 LIVE IN THE MOMENT forwardly placed from the start, ranged up to challenge three wide in the turn, clear when straightened for home, maintained a clear
 advantage to the wire while being kept to task. SHE'S A PENALTY bothered slightly at the start to be back early, advanced into the turn, asked aggressively
 midway on that bend, shifted out into the five path entering the stretch, closed some ground on the winner late while fully extended to hold the place spot.
 ELODY bumped at the start, fell far back in trailing, continued to lag turn, swung out to be widest for the drive, closest with good energy down the middle of
 the track to be rapidly getting to both the top two. KIKI DOO away in good order, chased leader early, vied turn, weakened in the drive.
 MAMADANCESINTHESKY back off the pace and the inside, floated out five wide entering the stretch, lacked a serious closing response but still managed
 to improve position.. SEFA'S WATT broke sharp, got clear before a quarter, vied through the turn, weakened in the drive. SUPER PHILLY bumped at the
 start, settled in mid pack for a half, had little left for the drive. SWAMP PRODUCTION within striking distance in the early going, steadily faded. A VOW TO
 CHLO CHLO tired while racing wide.

 Footnotes
 WHOZ TALKIN NOW devoid of early foot, began to advance on the outside turn, came four wide into the stretch and continued to move smartly to win going
 away. WILLIEVERWIN broke in bothering a couple of inner rivals, prompted the pace from the outside, four wide through the turn, proved no match for the
 winner late, up late for the place. MITCHNJOHNNY broke alertly, soon got clear to show the way up the backstretch, narrowly set the pace through the turn,
 continued to lead late, also proved no match for the winner late, nipped for the place in the final strides. KRISTINAS DAY WALK back off the pace from the
 start, turned in an even effort. RECKLESS RANSOM bothered at the start, was used a bit to advance into a forward position, prompted the issue three wide
 into and through the turn, was beginning to tire when shifted out in some traffic upper stretch, continued to weaken in the run to the wire. SHYLOH'S
 FRIEND last to leave, was never close. MI PADRE bothered at the start, was finished early. DARYLSLITTLEENGINE moved up to vie for the lead before a
 quarter off the inside, stopped in the drive.

 Footnotes
 JUBAL in the second flight early in the two path, continued to stalk backstretch, moved out and advanced on the leaders three wide far turn, gained the
 advantage and drove steadily clear through the lane. SUMMER APPEAL back off the pace while just off the inside, encountered some traffic into the far
 turn, three wide while still covered up late in that bend, set down when clear for the drive, no match winner, clear for the place. ROSE NEEDS A CHECK
 lacked early foot, raced outside, five wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to be along for the show. TEN SCARS forwardly placed after an alert break,
 moved up to vie into and through the second turn, weakened in the drive. MR. SHAD broke near the back, continued to lag, circled rivals to be six wide into
 the lane, improved position. WAR DEBT settled off the pace and the inside, moved out, was five down to four wide in the final turn, failed to muster a rally.
 RUN KERMIT RUN forward and outside first turn, moved up to narrowly show the way up the backstretch, gave way in the drive. GLORY KINGDOM off a
 step slow, never menaced. LIKE A DEPUTY took over and showed the way into the first turn, set or forced the issue for a half and faltered. ALEXANDER
 GLACKEN four wide into the first turn when toward the front, remained within striking distance for five furlongs then stopped in the far turn, trailed home.

 Footnotes
 LADY DIGGER bobbled slightly when breaking in a bumping ALAMO STAR, was quickly straightened to clear soon after, shrugged off a bid late in the turn
 to be clear again stretch, kept to task. ARCTIC PEACE off the early pace outside, moved closer in the four path into the turn, could do little with the winner
 the final furlong, edged clear for the place. MIRACLES YANKEE chased the winner early off the rail, moved closer and tried that one late in the bend, could
 not keep pace in the drive nor match the runner up, narrowly saved the show. SHOW'EM THE HEAT within striking distance while racing in the three path,
 tilted out four wide exiting the turn when roused, gaining for the show spot late. DALE'S LIL SIS lacked early foot, improved slightly without posing a serious
 threat. WILD APPOINTMENT forwardly placed early, shuffled back toward the inside into the turn, mid pack into the lane, had little for the drive.
 STACKOLEENA last to leave, failed to menace. ALAMO STAR bumped at the start, trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 BRIE BRIE'S JOY in the second group in the three path first turn, moved closer into the far turn, long duel to the wire, gained the nod in a determined effort.
 EL MOZO off a step slow, raced back, advanced after a half, challenged outside the winner in the second turn, floated out a bit into the lane, extended duel
 to the wire, outkicked. TAESTOOT void of early foot, continued back into the far turn, three wide, steered out wide for the drive and closed willingly to be
 clear of the others, no threat to the top two. SHINER'S HALF MOON off a step slow, raced off the inside, improved into the lane, flattened out in the final
 furlong to lose the show. LAST PORT forwardly place when closest to the early dueling leaders, had little left for the drive. STORM IS DUE was never
 dangerous. RENEGADE INDY checked up from between foes in the first turn, fell back and failed mount a bid. GOING PLACES dueled up front off the
 inside, gave way in the drive. MR HEARTBREAKHOTEL dueled up front while along the inside, stopped, distanced late after losing contact with the field.
