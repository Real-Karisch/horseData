 Footnotes
 GIRLSINTHEOFFICE was unhurried for a half mile, circled rivals four wide while rallying on the second turn, pushed to the front in mid stretch and drew
 clear under steady urging. BEAUTY OF AUTISM lagged to the second turn, closed the gap two then three wide to the stretch then bested the others without
 threatening the winner. SING IN THE WIND was chasing to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch by the winner
 and weakened. FEEL THE CHARGE contested the pace two wide for five furlongs, got overtaken into the stretch and tired. FLIKA was also on the pace
 from the rail to the second turn, briefly stayed on to the stretch then also tired and was not persevered with late. Fractions did not appear on the tote board
 but the race was electronically timed.

 KING EDDIE pressed the leader to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, collared PEPPERINO in mid stretch and held under steady urging. MAJOR
 IMPLICATIONS tracked the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch but was second best. WRITE ME A SONG had
 no speed, came three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. PEPPERINO was sent for speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then was
 tiring in the final furlong. TIMBER BARON had no speed and was never a threat. The fractions did not appear on the toteboard but the race was

 MAXINAMILLION was never far away, saved ground on the second turn, rallied to the front leaving mid stretch and held driving. KALEIDOSCOPE KID
 broke a bit slow then chased four wide to the second turn, remained four wide and rallied to the stretch, took a brief lead in mid stretch then could not stall
 the winner but saved the place. PASS DUE PAYMENT was fanned five wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, was four then five wide to the
 stretch then finished steadily but too late for second. CANDY'S MARTINI was outrun to the second turn, had to circle five wide to the stretch then loomed a
 threat to mid stretch but got outfinished late. ZUCCHINI stalked the pace to the second turn then was in traffic, checked off heels at the five sixteenths and
 could not recover in the drive. UNINVITED pressed the leader two wide to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and
 weakened. SIMPLY CHARMING hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the second turn, was two wide into the stretch which allowed the winner
 room inside and gave way.

 MARILYN'S SMILE pressed the pace to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and drew clear driving.
 MOMMY ROSE was chasing early, saved ground then shifted out into the stretch, could not impact the winner but dug in late to grab the place. PRINCESS
 ASHLYN hustled to the front, set the pace while off the rail, came three wide into the stretch, could not stall the winner in upper stretch and weakened late.
 ONE EYED MAMA was fractious just as the gate was sprung, threw her head, broke in the air and lost about ten lengths to the rest of the field and did not
 recover. DEVIL'S BEAUTY was chasing to the turn, got fanned out five wide to the stretch then weakened in the drive.

 DIAMANTE APPEAL was outsprinted to the turn, shifted out into the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily to prevail. KISS STEALIN stalked the
 leaders three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task and closed late to grab second. SITTIN AND THINKIN contested the pace off
 the rail to the stretch, responded determinedly to mid stretch then could not stall the winner and lost the place on the line. HOT AND SASSY stalked the
 pacesetters three wide, swung out five wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. CROSSHAVEN had good speed, dueled inside of SITTIN AND
 THINKIN while saving ground to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch but was weakening late. MADAME JEANETTE was chasing to the turn while outside
 rivals, drifted out six deep into the stretch and came up empty. FANTASTIC FIVE broke a bit slow, had no speed to the turn, advanced inside to the stretch,
 loomed boldly in mid stretch but was tiring late. PRETTY CHOICES also was a bit slow to begin, trailed to the turn, got pushed out four wide to the stretch
 and was never a threat. AMY'S APPEAL had no speed and was not a factor.
