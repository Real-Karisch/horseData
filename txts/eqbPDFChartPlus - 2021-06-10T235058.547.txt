 Footnotes
 GORSUCH cleared early, was nudged along setting the pace towards the rail, came three wide for the drive, drifted in leaving the three sixteenths, came
 back out some under left handed rousing and widened while kept to task. BRAHMS ROMP , taken to rate inside, took closer order mid turn, angled four
 wide to have aim into the stretch, was headed from his inside by LUCKY KICK near mid stretch, came back willingly and earned the place. LUCKY KICK
 settled off the pace, picked up momentum mid turn, sustained towards the inside to mid stretch, came out some soon after and hung late. ZESTY ZAR
 chased the pace, saved some ground in upper stretch but came up empty. HERE'S PACO advanced to a stalking spot after a quarter mile, prompted three
 to four wide outside the winner, failed to kick on after being put to a drive mid turn and faded. PATRIOTIC QUEST , four wide with early pursuit, faltered mid
 turn.

 Footnotes
 SMART ROYAL T set a pressured pace racing slightly off the rail and was kept to his business in the drive. FAR FROM AWESOME , off the rail entering the
 stretch, drifted in near the three sixteenths pole and had a mild rally along the rail to dead heat for place. TOP HAT CITY , three deep chasing the winner
 around the turn, finished gamely to dead heat for second. PAPAL LAW , steadied when shuffled back soon after the break, raced in the two path on the
 turn, worked between horses in the stretch and finished willingly. READY AIM circled the turn, angled to the five path at the head of the lane and came up
 empty. MR. MAGICIAN saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and passed tired horses. SCRAPPLE saved ground on the turn and
 was not a factor. PURE SPRING , never a factor, swung to the five path at the top of the stretch. ALBERTOS AL QUINTO , three wide on the turn, chased
 the pace and faltered.

 BALLARD HIGH cleared early, dictated the pace in the two path, moved away under some coaxing entering the lane, was kept alert with one tap in mid
 stretch and widened under steady hand encouragement. CALVI broke a step slow, edged up inside rivals nearing the three quarter pole and grabbed a
 stalking spot, chased while having TWO SWORDS just to his outside around the turn and into the lane, churned on with interest and was clearly second
 best. TWO SWORDS , bumped at the break, moved up between rivals stalking the early pace, emerged with CALVI to his outside as the closest pursuers
 mid turn, continued willing chase to mid stretch then faded. REAL FACTOR saved ground and lacked a rally. MAJOR ATTITUDE leaned in and bumped
 with TWO SWORDS at the break, was urged wide leaving the far turn but failed to respond. MARU'S RAVEN , three deep chasing the pace into the turn,
 dropped back after five furlongs.

 between horses down the backstretch, was lightly steadied in traffic near the quarter pole, swung four deep at the head of the lane and closed smartly.
 SUNRISEBERNSTEINI , three wide both turns, chased the pace in a willing effort. GRACEFUL REQUEST saved ground stalking the pace and weakened.
 GREAT MADRINA , between horses in a forward position most of the trip, failed to rally. BASH was no factor. OUR JULIET , four wide both turns, drifted to
 the inner rail in mid stretch. COUNTRY LINEDANCER was no factor. CARVED prompted the pace outside the winner and gave way. TIZ A
 GHOSTZAPPER , steadied soon after the break, dropped back on the backstretch.
