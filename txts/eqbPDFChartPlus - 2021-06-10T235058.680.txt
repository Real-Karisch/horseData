 PAY ANY PRICE took the lead just out of the gate, angled inside and continued to lead the way with LOST FOR WORDS applying pressure, awkward off
 stride near three eighths pole then took clear command without asking, wrapped up to easy victory in the lane. DIDDLEY raced in range then shaken up for
 the drive on three wide run, was no match for clear winner but produced decent finish and gained runner up spot. VERY COLORFUL raced in the back,
 saved ground along inside in the turn then gained up inside edged out for share. R CAT DADDY raced off the early speed then widest with some mild
 interest in the lane. LOST FOR WORDS applied pressure to eventual winner from on set into the turn then gaveway in the lane. BILLY THE BULL raced off
 the top pair near the inside then came out and dropped back head of the lane.

 Footnotes
 WANDA GIRL vied for the lead out of the gate then edged back to track the leader, raced near the inside then angled out a path and headed in pursuit
 leaving the turn, responded under three wide drive and edged away. BARBADOS KITTEN broke near the lead then sat just off early speed, put to drive
 along the rail in the turn, moved up inside in the stretch taking brief lead then outkicked late. DAWN LIGHTNING broke on top then raced three wide in close
 contention through the turn, came out bit wider and set down under strong right handed drive to gain show. SUPER WITCH cleared on top shortly after the
 start, continued to lead the way racing along the rail leaving the turn, came under pressure from both sides and weakened in final furlong. OSCURA raced in
 the back but never far from the frontend then drifted out in the stretch without threatening.

 early lead with eventual winner, could not match strides in the turn but never gave up and kept after rival to the end. HIGH MISCHIEF broke well then lacked
 early foot to continue on, put to drive five wide in the lane and gained ground in final furlong. JOURNEY TO HEAVEN was off step slow then sent hard out of
 the gate, gained contention racing along inside then flattened some, kept along under strong ride and came out late. A B G GUERRERO hopped at the
 break and came away slowly, raced in the back without threatening. LOVINGRDSIMMAR chased the pace then drifted out wide and failed to move on in the

 Footnotes
 VIOLENT WAVE was well spotted tracking the top pair of embattled leaders, picked up the pace under mild prompting going by three eighths pole then
 roused right handed to reach equal terms for the lead with MEMORIZE, shook off rival top stretch, cleared on top then came out wider under left handed
 encouragement, switched sticks late and held firm. DANCE WITH MACHO raced off the early pace saving ground, swung out and put to drive in the turn,
 continued wide bid but could not get to winner in the end. NOCATEE was restless in the gate then raced in range through early stages, came under a ride
 three furlongs out, continued driving in final stages, edged out for place but finished clearly best over the rest. MEMORIZE dueled for the lead out of the
 gate, continued to match strides with LA DUQUESA then shook free briefly clearing the lead, challenged by winner approaching the quarter pole, fought
 back entering the lane then had nothing left in reserve. AWESOME CLASS bobbled at the start then shifted to outside position, raced in the back and failed
 to move into contention. LA DUQUESA dueled inside of rival in early stages then retreated along the rail, eased to the wire and walked off after the race.

 Footnotes
 SOUND DEFENCE sped to the lead at the start, cleared and crossed inside, continued to lead the way still racing in hand through the turn, put to drive
 upper stretch, appeared to be tiring in the final furlong but remained clear and firm. AWESOMENDENSOME raced between rivals in crowded quarters in
 opening stages then gained closest spot off the leader and hustled up two wide through the turn, remained in pursuit on two wide run, could not reach
 winner, firm late for place. DANESSA AGAIN steadied bit racing along the rail in opening stages, sat on hold awaiting clear path near the inside, angled out
 and put to drive top stretch, gained on runner up spot then yielded. TAKE A STROLL raced between rivals in compact flight in opening stages, edged back
 from between and settled before launching inside bid top stretch, improved then evened out. CORDELE steadied shortly after the start then produced wide
 bid in the lane without threatening. HUG A TREE raced five wide not far from the frontend in early going, came out wider top stretch and lacked needed kick
 for impact. RARE INTEGRITY chased in close range but failed to keep up pace and weakened.

 SAINT MICHAEL hustled up to lead at the start, quickly joined by BIG DRINK OF WATER, dueled through the turn then cut the corner and emerged with
 narrow lead top stretch, edged away to clearer command in final furlong. BIG DRINK OF WATER came in after the start then sped up and angled inside to
 challenge SAINT MICHAEL for the lead, dueled outside of rival in the turn then failed to match strides top stretch but remained in striking distance and
 finished clear for second best. BENJI was closest pursuer of the clear top pair, continued driving three to five wide in the lane clearing share. BANCO
 NEGRO bumped back and forth hard just after the start then hustled up along outside in the turn, continued outside bid in the lane without threatening.
 ROSAS FOR JIMMY was briefly fractious in the gate then saved ground along the inside, roused up the rail and failed to move on in the lane. VALERIE
 FIRST broke in hitting the gate then pinballed back and forth repeatedly just after the start, never recovered. MAD LUTHER got bumped just after the start
 and failed to gain close contention. GOLDEN NOGUEZ bumped back and forth repeatedly just after the start and failed to move into range.

 settled nicely racing in hand going by the quarter pole, moved out couple paths and came under strong ride in the lane, held clear. PAT M'S IMAGE raced
 under snug hold to race in the last flight while saving ground along the inside, steadily made way off the inside then roused forward racing four deep at the
 quarter pole, bumped slightly top stretch then ridden up in striking distance of late leader, could not get by. SCHMISS was well positioned racing midpack
 saving ground along the inside, came out path top stretch bumping with rival, kept under strong left handed drive bumping with PLEIN AIR near the eighth
 pole then evened out. PLEIN AIR was rated just off second flight then prompted three wide at the quarter pole, bumped repeatedly with SCHMISS near the
 eighth pole, slight steady back from between then finished evenly. CONQUEST DYNASTY stalked to the far turn then hustled up two path leaving the far
 turn, squeezed between rivals top stretch then kept on with mild response. MISS SOPHIA'S STAR was forwardly placed racing just off pacesetter then

 FALSE ACCUSATION broke out and bumped at the start, dueled for the early lead racing inside of KYLE'S BOY, shook free from rival past the half mile
 marker, came out top stretch then back inside and pulled away. BAY HILL was briefly rank tossing head upon entering the first turn then settled nicely in
 stalking position, hustled up in the far turn then set down driving five wide in the lane and cleared second best. MASCARPONE brushed between rivals at
 the start then remained reserved racing in the back, made move in the lane and got up for show on the wire. BROADCAST TIME raced off the early pace
 then hustled up three wide in the far turn, angled closer to inside, kept under a ride and got nipped for share on the wire. BEACH TREASURE steadied
 approaching the first turn, was unhurried racing six wide in the backstretch then picked up the pace in the far turn, shaken up five wide for the drive, no late
 threat. KYLE'S BOY dueled outside of eventual winner in early stages, could not match strides past the half mile marker but kept along in range then faded
 in the lane. MARNESIA ONE STEP broke in and bumped with rival at the start, saved ground along the rail in the first turn then roused for more along inside
 in far turn, failed to move on. T'S SOUTHERN DUDE drifted out in the first turn, showed brief response then retreated. Race was hand timed

 Footnotes
 INHIBITION dueled for the early lead racing outside of JAI BLUE, shook away on top still in hand mid-way through the turn, repelled bid from MIAGO near
 the quarter pole but rival refused to back down and reached equal terms in late drive, dueled gamely from inside, got neck back in front and refused to
 relinquish control. MIAGO was rated under snug hold in the opening quarter then let out notch and steadily progressed up the inside reaching contention,
 made three wide bid for INHIBITION near the quarter pole, could not get to rival but remained in pursuit, wore rival down and reached noses apart at the
 sixteenths pole, dug in gamely but winner refused to be denied. AFFLUENTIAL lacked speed out of the gate then moved up closer racing two wide in the
 turn, continued steady inside bid in the lane to gain a piece of action. AGUJERO hustled up three to four wide in the turn then continued even bid two path in
 late drive. BIG FRIDGE steadied at the start then lagged out of the gate, roused along the outside then drifted wider in the lane. ADMIRAL JIMMY raced in
 range then steadily faded after the half. GLOBAL HERO came up empty after the half. JAI BLUE dueled inside of the eventual winner, could not match
 strides midway through the turn then had nothing left in the lane.

 Footnotes
 MOMENTA KAT sped to the lead, cleared and angled in from outside position, set the pace while rated under snug hold with SURELY TEMPLE the only
 close pursuer, saved ground and took clearer lead still unleashed in the far turn, came under drive upper stretch, responded, pulled away and wrapped up in
 the end. SURELY TEMPLE broke in and bumped at the start, took inside path then tracked leader two path while racing well clear over next rival, continued
 steady two wide bid for MOMENTA KAT in the lane, no match but stayed firm for place. UNTRUTHFUL SONNET raced off the early pace then hustled up
 past the half mile marker, gained ground on the top pair, kept along three wide in the drive and bested the rest. UNA LUNA raced off early pace, sent driving
 along the outside in the lane, improved position without threatening. MICHELLE'Z LAUGH raced in the back then cut the corner entering the lane, failed to
 make impact. MY TEMPLE showed response after the break, moved up into contention and angled closer to inside, driving along inside in the far turn to no
 avail. KARLIES BABY broke out and bumped at the start, showed early response then dropped back. SHELLSHACKUP failed to gain contention. BANDIDA
 RAGS empty after the half, eased to the wire then walked off.
