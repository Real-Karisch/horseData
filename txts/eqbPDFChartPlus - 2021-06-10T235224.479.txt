 MISS VICKI dueled from the inside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, remained clear through the second turn, widen the margin at the eighth
 pole and was much the best while never asked. MALINE stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when sat
 down for the drive and closed with a rush for the place. WANNA SNUGGLE dueled from the outside early, chased the pace up the backstretch, remained
 forward entering the drive but could not keep pace. YONNA SHE GOES outrun early, steadily advanced inside up the backstretch, made a bid entering the
 second turn, but could not sustain the effort. FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR was no real factor. MISS AVA CLAIRE forced the early pace inside but had nothing
 left. LADY PERDITA was never close.

 Footnotes
 LOVELY CHARLIE stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn,
 altered outside for the drive, responded and was along in time for the two thousandth win of the Jockey's career. EYE CRAFT forced the early pace from the
 outside, held a forward position for the drive but could not match strides while holding the place. FROLIC unhurried early from the inside, advanced through
 the second turn, altered outside for the drive and closed with a rush for the show. OVERTHEGARDENGATE dueled from the inside early, gained a clear
 margin up the backstretch, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole but weakened late. OUR SWEET SYDNI went evenly. CAN'T TOUCH ME was no
 factgor. SHE'SCREATIVE was no threat. RACH'SLASTSCARF forced the early pace and faded. SHIPMATE chased the early pace and tired.
