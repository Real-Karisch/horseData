 FACT CHECKING broke alertly but outward then showed brief speed, forced the pace on the backstretch, pressed the leader on the turn, bid in the final
 furlong and moved clear then held under a hand ride. PLACE THE BLAME briefly forced the pace, stalked three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch
 and finished gamely. FLOATING RATE led early on the main track, set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch, was passed in the final furlong and
 chased to the end. ESSENTIAL forced the issue, dropped back on the turn, raced three and four-wide to the stretch then closed with some interest. ATIYA
 showed brief speed, stalked into the turn, was roused three-wide late turn and finished gamely in vain. ONLY ESSA settled off the pace, chased three to
 five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. D'S MULLIGAN had brief speed, dropped back nearing the turn, was hustled along the rail but evened
 out mid stretch. GALS GOT RHYTHM was pinched back early and settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then was blocked upper stretch

 BOYHOOD DREAM, off slowly, stalked the pace, led mid turn, was joined at the 1/4 pole, dueled, drew clear a furlong out and held under a drive. DERBY
 REBEL, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the far turn, bid at the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch and gave way grudgingly through
 the final furlong. NIGHT WATCHMAN stalked the pace, raced two to four-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. SLAM settled
 in mid pack, closed three to five-wide on the final turn then finished with good energy. GIANT MINE raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn,
 chased into the stretch and finished evenly. HYTHE, rated in mid pack, saved ground on the far turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch then closed mildly
 when clear. KITTEN'S DILEMMA set a pressured pace, dueled through the backstretch, was headed mid turn, chased into the stretch and tired. DANCING
 WITH ZORRO forced the pace, dueled on the backstretch, was headed mid turn, chased to the stretch and tired. RARE APPEAL, away slowly, settled off
 the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. TRACK THAT ECHO stalked the pace, chased three to five-wide on
 the final turn but lacked a rally.

 Footnotes
 D MAGICIAN vied for the early lead and took over the front into the turn, repulsed a challenge from a rival late on the turn and into the stretch, had a clear
 lead mid stretch and maintained a diminishing lead late. NOBLE HOPE vied for the early lead inside the winner, allowed that rival to take over the front into
 the turn, then rail chased to the upper stretch when making an inside/out move before closing well late to make it interesting. JUST LIKE LARRY bumped
 with a rival at the start and gathered himself to stalk the early leaders, made a run at the front late on the turn and at the top of the stretch before flattening
 out late. COMBATIVE broke out badly at the start before rushing up five wide to stalk the leaders on the backstretch, was three wide chasing on the turn
 and stayed in contention before levelling off in the late stages. BRUTUS raced off the pace early before closing along the rail through the turn and down the
 lane, but did not threaten the leaders. CERRADO stalked along the inside until the upper stretch when taken to the outside, then lugged in somewhat while
 closing before finishing evenly. LUCKY STREET bumped a rival out of the gate and raced off the pace early, was moving up in the three path around the
 turn, then seemed to find his best stride inside the eighth pole and closed well late. OUR UNCLE DREW was off the pace and attempted a two to four wide
 run on the turn but could not reach contention. SEEMEE was in a mid pack position while three wide on the turn but fell back late on the turn and had no
 response .

 DEVINE MISCHIEF settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the turn, angled out upper stretch, rallied and was up just in time, driving. GLAMANATION,
 off slowly, stalked the pace, angled three-wide late turn, bid a furlong out, gained a short lead but was caught on the wire. JEAN ELIZABETH, bumped by
 MISS SAVVY leaving the gate, bid early on the main track, took control and set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch, was headed in the final
 furlong and battled to the end. RAVINIA settled off the pace, chased three to five-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. MISS SAVVY broke outward and
 bumped a rival, settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied late outside. WIN THE WAR stalked the
 pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then finished evenly but lost positions in the final furlong. ALEXANDRA KAY was sent to an early lead, was
 headed and forced the issue on the main track, retreated from the top of the stretch and lacked any further response.. BINT HUWAAR stalked the pace,

 Footnotes
 RED EXPLOSION showed brief speed then stalked the pacesetter, closed late turn, swept to the lead at the top of the stretch then widened under a hand
 ride. MEXICAN HAT, off slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then chased through the stretch. BLURRICANE raced in mid pack,
 was hustled four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and closed steadily. SAN NICOLA STORM, rated in mid pack, was hustled angling from two to
 four-wide through the turn but evened out in deep stretch. DELAMAR raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. SILVER
 SIDNEY, in mid pack four-wide, chased three-wide into the stretch and finished gamely to no avail. SILVER PRINCESS sprinted clear approaching the gap,
 set a reserved pace, was under a drive late turn but was passed at the top of the stretch, chased briefly and was through. NORTHERN KISS, off slowly,
 settled well back early, was hustled on the turn but never reached contention.

 Footnotes
 CAMP CREEK settled in midpack, saved ground in the early stages, began to improve position on the backstretch, continued to race along the inside into
 the far turn, commenced a bid on that final turn, angled two-wide at the 3/8ths pole as he took the look, fought off a game SINE METU in early stretch and
 finished strong. SINE METU was unhurried early, saved ground on the first two turns, angled off of the rail on the backstretch, raced from two to three-wide
 on the far turn, commenced a bid as they approached the top of the stretch, loomed dangerous in early stretch but was a clear second best.
 ITSTARTSWITHADRINK was void of early speed settling far back from the early leaders, began to close on the far turn while saving ground and continued
 to improve in the stretch despite not threatening the top two. LEOPARD CAT dropped back to trail the field far back from the pacesetters, began to rally on
 the final turn racing two and three-wide, was blocked in the stretch until the furlong pole and passed tiring foes late. TWENTYTWENTYCREST showed early
 foot, tracked the pacesetter early racing two-wide, fell to midpack as they entered the second turn, reached contention again into the far turn where she
 raced four and three-wide then chased evenly in the stretch. ARTISTICO raced from midpack on the outside, was two-wide on the opening turn then
 three-wide on the second turn, was widest of all on the backstretch, raced from five to four-wide on the far turn and lacked response in the stretch.
 STRONGBOX showed brief speed but quickly fell back while racing wide on the opening turn, began to rally on the far turn while racing three-wide but failed
 to sustain the bid in the stretch. SEEKING THE BAY showed early speed, stalked the leader into the backstretch, took command entering the far turn, was
 headed past the 3/8ths pole and faltered. J M R SILENT SAM was sent to the front, set the pace well into the backstretch, faltered on the far turn, was
 distanced and walked off. DUE TO AN ERROR THE INCORRECT FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE POSTED ON TV

 DREAMS ARE FREE forced the pace in a race that saw no moves being made until the far turn, took command early on the far turn, moved clear then
 widened in the stretch and held sway under a drive. HOT CASH settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, rallied determinedly and was
 gaining late. POWER EMPIRE (JPN) stalked the pace, was hustled hard late on the final turn then finished gamely along the rail. SOTHATSTHEWAYITIS
 settled in mid pack, was hustled late turn, encountered traffic at the top of the stretch then finished all out when clear. I LOOK INCREDIBLE raced in mid
 pack, chased three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the stretch. ALICE'S WAR stalked the pace, closed three-wide on the far turn, chased into the
 stretch but evened out in the final furlong. SCREENWRITER settled off the pace, chased three to five-wide on the far turn, closed through the stretch but
 was never contentious. SNIPPY led early, set a pressured pace, was headed early on the far turn, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally.

 Footnotes
 ROSE RING veered in leaving, angled out on the turn, closed three and four-wide, lost her path briefly at the top of the stretch then rallied determinedly and
 got up late. DILLY DALLY DARBY stalked the pace, bid four-wide late turn, dueled into the stretch, gained the lead, shook clear a 16th out but was caught
 near the wire. DIRTY GIRL was steadied when DIVA ON A DIME veered out in front of her at the start, settled in mid pack, chased three to five-wide on the
 turn, ducked out upper stretch and chased to the end. JUPITER'S EAGLE broke inward and bumped PODGORA, stalked the pace, bid three-wide late turn,
 dueled into the stretch but yielded in the final furlong and chased to the wire. DIAMOND EXPRESS raced in mid pack, saved ground, chased into the stretch
 then rallied gamely inside. DIVA ON A DIME veered in at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished under a
 determined drive. PODGORA, bumped at the outset, settled in mid pack, raced angling from two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and closed
 with some interest. PERFECT ROAD led quickly, was pressured on the turn, was engaged late turn and yielded at the top of the stretch and chased to the
 end. WEDDING RING was taken back early and settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then moved inside and finished along the rail.
