 COLONEL JUAN settled inside, came out three wide nearing the stretch while rallying, ran clear in early stretch and widened under brisk urging. KOAN was
 bumped leaving the gate, chased outside the early leader, gave his best two wide on the final turn then weakened in the drive. HOWBOUTDEMPATS was
 slow inside, came out between horses in the drive and was up for the show. HIS ROYAL MAJESTY stayed outside and lacked the needed closing
 response. WONITBYLAND made the pace along the rail for over three quarters then tired. WHATA MOOSE ducked into KOAN leaving the gate and was
 finished after five furlongs.

 PAPADOPALOUS settled early, steadied in the two path behind the leaders approaching the quarter pole, was sent to vie inside the leaders into the final
 furlong, took over in midstretch then drove clear. BIG BAD DUDE didn't break sharply, advanced early between horses, took over two wide midway on the
 turn, ran out into BARRACUDA WAYNE entering the stretch, couldn't stay with the winner through late stretch but held the place. BARRACUDA WAYNE
 was slow early, rallied three wide to vie before a half, was bumped when carried wide into the stretch, opened a clear lead into the final furlong then gave
 way. MIDNIGHT GAMES was unhurried inside, came out in the lane and gained mildly. BRANDED HAND made the pace along the rail into the turn and
 was finished after a half.
