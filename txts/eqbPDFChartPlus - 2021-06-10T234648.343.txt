 Footnotes
 PRIMETIME GAL allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then closed
 fast and drove clear late. GOIN WITH THE FLO well placed, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and lacked the needed
 late kick. DANCIN IN THE SOUP chased the pace just off the rail, angled out to bid four wide into the stretch and stayed on to hold the show. MARY'S IN
 UTOPIA improved her position, outside. JUSTPLAINAWESOME sprinted to a clear lead quickly, then faded the final furlong. PRINCESS BOSSY was never
 involved.

 NOBLE DOSS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin while never being challenged, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to
 the task. SMART THINKING tracked the pace, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then could not threaten the
 winner, while clearly best of the rest. FOREVER UTOPIA well placed and inside, saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into
 the stretch and held the show. MANDOLIN WINS improved position. SIDEWAYS VISION showed little. EMERGENCY EXIT was no factor.
