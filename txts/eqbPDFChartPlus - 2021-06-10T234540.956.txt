 Footnotes
 CANDY CARLOS was rated off the first flight a bit off the inside tracking those rivals into the backstretch, commenced a steady advance three deep nearing
 the far turn to gain terms with the pacesetter in upper stretch, then took over from that foe and went clear late under firm right handed encouragement.
 COOL AMBITION, urged through close quarters at the start to dispute the pace a bit off the rail inside a rival to the backstretch, set the pace on a narrow
 margin racing into the far turn, held sway into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner while holding a rival for the place honors.
 COOKIES ARE GOOD tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, was prompted to advance on the far turn, angled to the rail to bid
 inside the pacesetter in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. HUSKY CLIPPER, bumped at the start, was righted to gain a position inside foes to
 briefly contend as part of the second flight racing into the backstretch, but steadily faded entering the far turn. P J'S AWESOME broke inwards exchanging
 solid contact with HUSKY CLIPPER, was taken up while dropping well off the field in the opening stages and never regained contention. GOLD HAWK,
 urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, steadily faded racing into the far turn.

 Footnotes
 ALWAYS A CATCH was settled in hand dropping into last near the inside racing to the first turn, pulled his way steadily to contention inside a rival in second
 flight to track just off the leaders entering the far turn, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch advancing on the leaders while continuing under firm restraint,
 moved to take command racing through the stretch while never being asked and widened to the end in an easy effort. GOLDEN GIFT, urged to prompt the
 pace inside a rival racing into the backstretch, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner while proving best
 of the others. PERFECT KARMA broke readily, forced the pace outside a rival into the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn and gave way nearing
 midstretch. CROCE D'ORO tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, continued in tandem with the eventual winner racing into the
 far turn, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and soon gave way. THIRST QUENCHER was a brief factor tracking the leaders as part of the second
 flight but retreated after three furlongs.

 REVOLT, reserved dropping into last while angling to inside racing into the first turn, steadily drew into contention near the inside after a half, was urged to
 split foes advancing on the pacesetter racing through the far turn, moved to wrest the advantage nearing midstretch and grudgingly held the late challenge
 of SUMMER DISCO to the end under firm left handed encouragement. The latter, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to a
 contending position, was eased back entering the backstretch to track outside foes, was urged to advance four wide racing into the far turn, then continued
 three deep into upper stretch while finishing willingly to close the gap on the winner to the end. MOONSHINER, urged between foes forcing the pace racing
 to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival for a half, went clear racing into the far turn, set the pace to upper stretch but faltered when challenged
 by the winner. BUDDY BUD was rated tracking just off the first flight three deep into the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes in that path
 racing into the far turn but came up empty nearing upper stretch. UNBRIDLED GIANT, urged inside rivals from the outset disputing the pace into the
 backstretch, pressed the issue for a half and emptied out abruptly racing into the far turn.

 MYSTIQUE ARTISTE tracked off the first flight outside a rival under light reserve in the opening quarter, advanced on the leaders three deep nearing upper
 stretch to challenge for command midstretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest a narrow advantage in time under pressure. ARTIC
 VORTEX, urged to dispute the pace from the outset racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, angled to the inside disputing the issue into upper stretch
 and resisted grudgingly while just failing to contain the winner. TRYST CAT joined the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, pressed the issue into
 upper stretch but weakened between the top pair nearing the wire. PARA VIVIR tracked off the second flight between foes under light reserve racing to the
 turn, shifted out four wide entering upper stretch and was urged to advance in close quarters while closing the gap willingly to the end. BOOHOO SUE
 tracked just off the leaders inside the eventual winner in the opening quarter, was caught in close quarters between foes racing into upper stretch but lacked
 the needed final kick. DOROTHE MARIE tracked off the second flight inside in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an even
 effort. WADDLE tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid.
 PRECIOUS KOWGIRL broke slowly, then was held up along the inside dropping off the field in the opening stages, raced wide into the turn and proved no
 threat.

 BOOTLEGGIN was settled in the opening stages while angling to the inside, steadily gathered momentum shifting outside foes nearing upper stretch,
 angled inwards while producing a sharp rally midstretch to split rivals just off the inside to bid inside the pacesetter, then wrested the advantage and went
 clear in time under a few right handed taps. LEGENDARY VISION broke outwards bumping MADE TO FIT, was quickly righted to track the leaders outside
 a rival racing into the turn, was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors late while outkicked by
 the winner. DOM THE BOMB gained terms with a rival prompting that foe's pace in the opening stages, dueled for command into upper stretch to gain a
 brief advantage but faltered nearing the wire. LITTLE BALTAR angled inwards tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing into the turn, shifted
 out nearing upper stretch to bid three deep between foes but lacked the needed final kick. ROSKILDE was urged along the inside from the outset disputing
 the pace, dueled for command into the turn and gave way in the drive. MADE TO FIT broke awkwardly, then was bumped at the start, settled outside rivals
 in early stages and lacked a rally. CHEBURASHKA settled outside foes early and proved no threat. FLYINGBYU broke in the air, then was taken up in the
 opening stages and never menaced thereafter.

 ABSOLUTE CONTROL broke readily to gain a narrow advantage outside a rival, was urged clear remaining off the rail racing into the turn, held sway on a
 comfortable margin into upper stretch and maintained that advantage to the end under pressure. SILVER QUARTERS ducked inwards at the start, tracked
 off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and found his best stride in late stages nearest the rail to edge rivals for the place
 honors. WARRIORS GEM tracked off the second flight four wide in the opening quarter, made steady progress in that path to upper stretch to gain
 contention but was outkicked for the place honors. GOLDS'WAY tracked just off the pacesetter three deep in the opening stages, was urged to close the
 gap on that foe racing into upper stretch but flattened out in late stages. CEE R BEE tracked off the second flight three wide between foes into the turn and
 continued evenly in late stages. BLAME THE MAKERS broke slowly, raced five wide into the turn, then six wide into upper stretch but had no late bid.
 PATCH'S LUGH tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. STAND WITH HONOR never seriously menaced.
 INTRYSTING made brief pursuit just inside the pacesetter racing into the turn but gave way entering the bend. KISSEDTHEGIRLS dropped out early.

 SIR ANTHONY, reserved inside rivals off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, shifted out four wide nearing
 midstretch and produced a stout rally to wrest command and go clear late under firm left handed encouragement. RUFFOLO sped to the fore outside foes in
 the opening stages, angled to the rail once clear, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch, turned back several rivals to late stages but proved
 no match for the winner. PAT'S SHOES switched off the inside early tracking the pacesetter between foes in second flight, advanced three deep to upper
 stretch to lodge a bid but had no final kick. RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS angled inwards in the opening stages to track just off the pacesetter a bit off the
 inside, prompted the leader racing into the far turn, continued to bid between foes into upper stretch but flattened out in late stages. PLENTIFUL tracked off
 the second flight outside foes in the opening half, raced four wide through the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. RIVER CACTUS tracked off
 the second flight between foes in the opening half and came up empty racing through the far turn. DOMIKATE broke slowly and soon dropped out.

 first turn while drifting out four wide, continued unhurried in that path between foes on the backstretch, commenced a steady advance three deep racing into
 the far turn and produced a sustained response to wear down the pacesetter to narrowly prevail between foes in time under left handed encouragement.
 BRAVO DIXIE was settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and found his best
 stride late to challenge for command nearing the wire while just outkicked. YOU SPLIT TENS, urged to the lead along the inside, moved away to a
 comfortable advantage on the backstretch, held sway under prompting racing into upper stretch, then past the furlong marker but was collared in the final
 strides. ATTAIN SUCCESS, forced five wide by the eventual winner racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders outside rivals through the backstretch,
 angled inwards a bit on the far turn and continued willingly between foes to gain some position late. APRECIADO, forwardly placed tracking the leader from
 just out of striking distance to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid on the far turn, shifted inwards under pressure racing into upper stretch and
 faded late. BALLISTIC MISSILE settled near the inside racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. ENGLISH RANSOM tracked the leaders from
 out of striking distance three wide between foes into the backstretch and came up empty racing into the lane. CLOUD TO GROUND, held up avoiding some
 traffic in the opening stages, angled out five wide racing into the backstretch and soon faded.
