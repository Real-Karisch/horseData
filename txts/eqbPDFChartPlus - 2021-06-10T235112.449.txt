 Footnotes
 R T ALAMO attended the early pace inside, switched outside the leader about the mid-point of the turn, moved to challenge in upper stretch then drew clear.
 LIL MISS DE BUY broke on top, eased back off the leaders content to stalk three wide, hit her best stride late to gain the place but was left with too much to
 do. LOOK AT THIS CAT set the early tempo racing off the inside, edged clear on the turn and shifted in leaving that bend, weakened when headed. APPLE
 COUNTY chased in behind the leaders running mostly two to three wide and went evenly. WHAT A SURPRISE raced toward the back off the inside early,
 asked for run about the five-sixteenths, improved position in the three or four path in the lane. FREAKY FAST broke outwardly just a bit, trailed early, asked
 for run midway on the turn racing outside, shifted further still to be six wide at the head of the stretch. FLATTER ME LILI saved ground to no avail. LOST IN
 THE FROST was brushed lightly at the break, chased four to five wide on the turn and was empty for the drive.

 out up the backstretch, exchanged a light brush with the winner about the half-mile marker, made a mild bid near inside in upper stretch but needed more.
 FLYING BOB ED broke inwardly, was urged clear to set the pace, drifted out through the turn, weakened in the lane. SUMMER RUNNER chased inside and
 had no rally. FLYING PRETTY chased the leaders going four wide into the turn, came up empty.

 made a brief bid on the turn, flattened out. HEAT STROKE raced inside and failed to rally. RITZY WAON was bumped lightly at the break, raced off the
 inside, failed to make a bid.

 Footnotes
 WHISKEYDRUNKAGAIN set the pace raacing off the rail, drifted out a bit leaving the turn, cleared. EKATI WILDCAT was urged along advancing four to five
 wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but held second. PUMPKIN STAR switched off the inside trailing the field, made a solid move five to six wide
 on the turn but needed more in the lane. SUPER SENOR advanced outside foes in about the three path leaving the turn, shifted in through the stretch and
 improved some. DANCING WITH DOGIE chased from outside going three to four wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. WESTMONT raced up
 close inside, took closer order into the turn, weakened in the stretch. MY OLE BUD chased from between rivals early then dropped back. FETED was ridden
 along and never a factor.

 GET A NOTION settled, advanced outside foes on the turn fanning six wide, took aim and got up late under stout and steady urging. SWEET PLATINUM
 advanced four wide on the turn, took over in upper stretch, was collared late. MALIBU DUDE sped well clear soon after the break, shifted in late up the
 backstretch, was headed in upper stretch and weakened. SINCE FOREVER chased from inside, failed to rally. LIL BIT OF THUNDER altered out as the
 pacesetter shifted in up the backstretch, came back in pursuing that one from between rivals on the turn, needed more. DAGGER TATTOO altered out with
 the aforementioned up the backstretch, raced betwen foes into the turn then continued outside rivals three to four wide on that bend, failed to rally. MR
 JANIMAL never fired. WAY BEST had no response when asked. FIND WATER was no factor. CHAPO came wide into the stretch and made no bid.

 TOY'S PARTY saved ground tracking along the rail early, switched out and commenced a bid five wide on the far turn, took over in upper stretch and drew
 clear under urging. MUSIC GIANT was caught four to five wide through the first turn racing toward the back of the field, advanced some into the far turn still
 traveling wide through that bend, gained the place over. CLASSY CAM , who was forced four wide through the first turn pressing the pace outside,
 continued four deep into the far turn challenging for and taking the lead early on that bend, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened slightly. UNCLE
 FLOYD raced mostly two to three wide and between runners near or on the lead, kept on evenly in the stretch. CLASSIC GENT was fractious in the gate
 and away a step slowly, settled racing on or just off the rail inside foes saving some ground through the turns, improved position racing evenly. TAMAIT (FR)
 was among the leaders three wide and between foes early, dropped back and weakened. SAMMY BOY set the pace inside under pressure, gave way.
 ARTAKSEZ raced three wide and between foes through the first turn and was never near enough to threaten. GRAN MISTERIO stumbled at the start,
 chased mid-pack off the inside, tired. HUNTERWOOD failed to menace.

 LOOKS TO SPARE settled off the pace near the inside, advanced into the far turn, waited briefly for room past the quarter pole, got through between
 runners at the head of the lane and soon drew clear under a drive. TAP THE ADMIRAL caught five wide through the first turn racing outside toward the
 back, advanced into the far turn going four to five wide on that bend, gained second in late stretch. SMACK RIDGE settled off the leaders racing near the
 inside, rallied through between rivals past the sixteenth pole and just got show honors over AWESOME K P, who was forced four wide around the first turn,
 tucked in behind the leaders but off the fence tracking those, came out a path for room in the stretch and improved position while gaining late but just
 missing third. DE FACTO was getting out through the first, pressed the pace taking closer order from between runners into the far turn and taking a narrow
 advantage on that bend, weakened in the stretch. MIGHTY BROWN set the pace inside, vied inside foes on the far turn, weakened. LAYCOCK BAY
 pressed the pace going mostly three to four wide, weakened. RISING GIANT was outrun.

 Footnotes
 GOLDEN GEISHA advanced into the turn, moved four wide on that bend taking over at the top of the stretch, drew off under a drive. BARBARA JO was
 forwardly-placed inside pressing the early pace, dropped back and switched out on the turn, came past the quarter pole four wide, was no match for the
 winner but got second. SAMMY BLUE CAT set the pace racing off the rail, weakened. C. G. RELIANCE settled into stride toward the back, steadily
 advanced outside foes into and on the turn, fanned six wide into the stretch and gained mildly. HOLLY TSU TSU stalked mid-pack off the inside, came into
 the stretch five wide, needed more. LITTLE BIT LOUDER raced toward the back outside a rival, advanced some on the turn, came out in upper stretch and
 carried on mildly. PAINT HER BLACK showed brief speed outside then retreated. MODJESKA HEAT stalked the leaders about three to four wide, gave
 way. FASTINATING ALLIE moved forward to prompt the pace from between rivals, continued the chase inside, weakened. WHATS THE DRAMA was no
 factor.
