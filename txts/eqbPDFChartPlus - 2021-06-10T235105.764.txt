 TWILIGHT APPEAL flanked off pace four wide, took over, while drifting through the stretch, all out to the wire to clear. EYE ON THE MONEY good position,
 rallied outside past the quarter pole while no match for winner late. IMITATE stalked leader to the stretch but leveled out in the drive. BEYOND DETECTION
 had no speed to the stretch and only improved position in the drive. TERRIFIC PLAY inside position to far turn and failed to respond when needed. GLOBAL
 WARNING raced widest into first turn and failed to menace. TIZ ALL BIZ was antsy in the gate, showed good speed to the front but was used up and tired
 after three quarters. SHOW THE WORLD failed to menace. LAND OR SEA lunged at the start and never a factor.

 Footnotes
 TAURUS C sprinted off at once, stayed clear all the way under good handling. BATTLE CROSSING no speed to far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch
 while no match for the winner. LOUIE'S HIGHWAY inside run to far turn, rallied for the show spot in the drive. MIXMAKER chased winner to far turn with no
 late punch when needed. KINDA CHAOTIC no speed for three quarters, came widest into the stretch and only moved up late. NEXT BIG THING outside run
 to far turn and stretch but failed to sustain that bid and came up empty. MY LAST SECRET never a factor. ROCK AND RATTLE was through after a half
 and failed to menace thereafter. RAJA forced wide into first turn and not a threat thereafter. ZONEMAN rail trip backstretch, mild move far turn, came up
 empty and faded.
