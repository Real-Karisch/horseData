 Footnotes
 JERICHO MARSH hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace, opened a clear lead entering the stretch and held sway under pressure. I'VE GOTTA PLAN
 disputed the pace outside the winner, dropped back in upper stretch and gamely battled back. TACHYON , three wide the first turn, advanced three deep
 leaving the far turn then flattened out. WHISKEY DREAMIN lacked speed, circled the far turn three wide, worked between horses in the stretch and passed
 tired ones. LUNAR IMAGE , three wide the first turn, saved ground in a forward position around the far turn then weakened. CONQUEST BANDIT , outrun,
 swung wide in upper stretch. HUNCA ROCK , fractious behind the starting gate, raced along the inner rail and weakened. THE MASON FACTOR was
 outrun.

 Footnotes
 MASAI MAN relaxed three deep prompting the issue, was nudged clear approaching the stretch, responded to steady handling through final furlong and
 held firm. HELLO AMIGO , away alertly, vied inside a pair of rivals, dropped back a bit past the five sixteenths, came back towards the rail in upper stretch
 and continued valiantly to the line. BIG BOOTS , urged from the gate, chased the leaders while saving ground, angled five wide into the lane, straightened
 but failed to seriously kick on. BAYANO was sent up between foes and gained a slim lead, dueled to the five sixteenths, stayed on to the head of the lane
 then gave way. POWER BACK chased outside a rival, failed to kick on under pressure approaching the quarter pole and gave way.

 BUSTOFF settled four wide, came under pressure mid turn, shifted out a bit and circled five wide into the lane, closed under a steady drive, drifted in past
 the furlong grounds, assumed command about a sixteenth out and drew clear. WHENTHEDOVESCRY sped clear early, set the pace under a light hold and
 towards the inside, maintained a clear lead under a drive past the furlong grounds, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. GOLD MAN broke a step
 slow, angled out and edged up between runners, shifted four wide, moved up past the three sixteenths, lightly steadied inside the eighth pole, regrouped
 and closed willingly. UPLIFTING , three wide nearing the half mile marker, prompted the pace and came under heavy pressure near the quarter pole,
 remained a presence pas6 the eighth pole then faded. TRICKY LION saved ground, was in a bit close nearing the turn and came up empty. IN ARREARS
 dropped off the pace, raced removed from the rail and was not asked for his best.

 FEARLESS TERP sprinted to the early lead, set the pace two wide around the turn, drifted to the inner rail in mid stretch and lasted under energetic urging.
 DON'T POKE THE CAT hugged the inner rail stalking the pace around the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch until altering course outside the winner
 near the sixteenth pole then closed gamely. COUSIN JIMMY , two wide on the turn in striking position, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied
 outside rivals. ALLABOUTMIKE chased the pace three deep around the turn and lacked the needed rally. UNEQUIVOCAL , four wide leaving the turn,
 trailed.

 Footnotes
 HANALEI'S HOUDINI settled outside a rival early on, eased out around the final turn, circled four to five wide into the lane, leveled off after being put to a
 solid drive leaving the three sixteenths, closed determinedly and forged ahead in the final yards. STREET COPPER stalked three wide, moved to engage
 the leader nearing the lane, spurted away under pressure in mid stretch but failed to last. MR. D'ANGELO settled off the inside, picked up momentum three
 wide leaving the far turn, chased the leaders into the lane then flattened out. TRIFOR GOLD cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was nudged
 along on the lead past the five sixteenths, could not fend off a challenge in upper stretch and gave way. BAY BRIDGE saved ground pursuing the pace and
 faded. BOWSPRIT , between rivals leaving the five eighths pole, failed to respond. BARIN rated back from between foes leaving the gate, lagged inside,
 angled out leaving the far turn but lacked a run. DASHING LOU saved ground and faltered after a half mile.

 MY BROTHERSLEDGE rushed up outside horses leaving the backstretch when eager to go, launched a challenge for the lead outside SEVIILE BARBER
 near the five sixteenths pole, dueled with that one through the stretch and determinedly prevailed. SEVILLE BARBER showed speed along the inner rail,
 dueled with the winner through the stretch and just missed in a game performance. PRETTY GOOD YEAR saved ground, swung outside in upper stretch
 and rallied late. ABSOLVED stalked the pace racing off the rail and failed to rally. BELTWAY BOB lacked speed, swung to the five path leaving the far turn
 and passed tired foes. NO KNOCK RAID , carried wide by A TRUE GENTLEMAN entering the first turn, raced four wide the far turn and failed to be a factor.
 A TRUE GENTLEMAN bore out entering the first turn, rushed up outside horses entering the backstretch, chased the pace to the far turn and tired.

 Footnotes
 ZITARROSA brushed with CREEPY THE CRAB at the break, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace near the rail and was under brisk urging in the
 drive. SING A VERSE , two wide on the turn, rallied inside horses and brushed STACKSDENERO when drifting out approaching the finish.
 STACKSDENERO , three wide on the turn, flattened out and was brushed late. LIAR , two wide on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and
 offered a mild gain outside rivals. CREEPY THE CRAB brushed with the winner at the break, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. VALLEY
 CAL , four wide on the turn, was outrun. AGGREGATE saved ground on the turn while chasing the pace, angled out turning for home and lugged in near the
 eighth pole when tiring. WILLIE THE WHALE chased the pace two wide on the turn and faltered.
