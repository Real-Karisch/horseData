 four wide into the first turn, settled in a stalking position, surged to the front while angling inside the leader on the second turn, opened a clear advantage
 before the furlong marker then came up empty. NICE SHOT dueled for the lead two wide through the first turn, opened a daylight lead before a half, got out
 then gave way after six furlongs. CHLOE'S WONDERBOY was no threat. BARBWIREBILLY was no factor. KERF was hung three wide into the first turn
 then through after a half. PHOTO SHOOT showed little. MAGNA ACCOUNT dueled for the lead two wide through the clubhouse turn and was through early.
