 Footnotes
 FLAME MINGO vied from in hand to the stretch, rider let out a notch and went clear in ridden out fashion little to no urging. SNOW BLOSSOM never far
 back to the turn, rallied three wide while second best and no match for winner. BEHOLD no speed to the stretch with an inside run and moved up late for
 third. BEL CANTO vied with winner to turn but could not go on with rider going to the post with no whip.. DELIGHTFUL DIAMOND no speed throughout
 while never a menace. EVENSCORE pushed along early, raced rank to the three sixteenth pole and showed little. ONE LOVELY STORM flashed brief
 speed inside but gave way readily.
