 Footnotes
 CANNETO BEACH stalked the leader to the turn, challenged from the outside and cleared foe, led through the drive and held safely. BOOGIE settled along
 the inside, moved over into the two path on the turn, angled back to the inside in the stretch, rallied and closed ground on the winner. DREAMIN' OF BLAZE
 sped to the front from the rail, set the pace up the backstretch, lost command around the turn and was no match for the top pair. LANCASTERINVISION
 tracked off the rail, three wide into the lane and finished evenly. GOT U BABE chased from the inside and was through early.
