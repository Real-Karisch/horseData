 Footnotes
 DOUBLE THE CHEERS stalked close up two wide, steadied in tight at the seven sixteenths marker, came three wide into the stretch, closed gamely outside
 and surged late to get up for a share of the win. RUBLE set the pace racing just off the inside, drew clear in upper stretch, dug in gamely late and held on for
 a share of the top spot. MORALLY INFLEXIBLE raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide entering the turn, chased and bested the others along the
 rail. A SIXTIES TUNE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, went four wide into the turn, chased and weakened. Z J WINS was bumped at the start
 and outrun. DRAXHALL WOODS raced close up early on the rail, chased and faded.
