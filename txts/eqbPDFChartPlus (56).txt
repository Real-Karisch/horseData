 Footnotes
 UNOBTAINABLE broke in and bumped at the start, sped to the front with pressure to the outside, cleared outside rival and drew away in the lane. HUEY
 stalked outside the leader, three wide around the turn, chased in the lane but lacked the needed late punch. DUTT BART chased early, off the rail then
 shifted in near the three-eighths and bothered rivals, continued along the inside and weakened in the stretch. TACO TUESDAY tracked off the rail, three
 wide then angled out further and failed to rally. THE SLEEPY PRINCE bumped at the start, was in tight and steadied near the three-eighths pole and could
 not rally after. SOFT TRIP bumped both sides at the start, forced in near the three-eighths pole, tracked along the inside to the lane and never rallied.
 HOLLY CAT bumped at the start, angled out on the backstretch, came three wide into the lane and proved no menace. The Stewards disqualified DUTT
 BART from third to sixth for shifting in and interfering with SOFT TRIP and THE SLEEPY PRINCE near the three-eighths pole.

 Footnotes
 COW DOG set the pace clear to the turn, opened up around the turn and ridden out to the wire. ROSIESCRUELLA stalked outside the leader, two wide into
 the turn, drifted out a bit around the bend, couldn't summon the needed rally but held second. RCATCANSCAT settled off the rail, angled in entering the
 turn, saved ground into the lane and gained ground in the late stages. BELLA RAQUELLA showed no early speed, raced three wide around the turn and
 improved position. ELUSIVE MISTRESS raced along the rail into and around the turn and never responded to urging. BLAZING MISS traveled near the
 back of the field, two wide to the lane and never threatened. Due to a timer malfunction the second race was hand-timed and no fractions were recorded.
