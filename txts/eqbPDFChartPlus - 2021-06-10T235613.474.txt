 Footnotes
 DYNAMIC WAR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. NO INTEREST mid pack
 and outside, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and closed well for the place. SILENT SOFIA tracked
 the pace well back, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the lane, then could not gain on the top two and held the show.
 BACKSPLASH allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals and got up for a share. GOOD SALLY allowed to settle,
 saved ground through the turns, bid on the two path into the lane and weakened in the stretch. LACEE was no factor. CHRISTMAS DINNER well placed,
 looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path and had no rally.

 GLOBAL HERO mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane gaining a short lead, then shook clear and drew off in
 the late going. GOLD WING allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well for the place.
 AFTERBURNER well placed and outside, moved up to a short lead three wide through the second turn, then was no match for the winner and held the
 show. BUZZ OFF allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and got up for a share. THAT'S
 BUCKBEAK well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals and flattened out. RED CAT (CHI) mid pack, gained
 position four wide through the second turn, bid on that path and faded in the drive. MOTATAN stalked the pace on the inside, moved up to gain a short lead

 Footnotes
 HOTSHOT ANNA well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and
 drove clear late. TALK VEUVE TO ME stalked the early pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, stayed on when challenged in
 the lane, then was no match for the winner and held the place. MISERICORDIA (GB) allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that
 path into the lane a flattened out, gaining the show. REGAL CHANT set the early pace just off the rail, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then
 weakened the final furlong and held a share. SPRING IN THE WIND allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the
 lane, angled in and could not gain. LATE NIGHT POW WOW well placed and between rivals, was pushed out, steadied and pinched back into the turn,
 fanned widest into the lane and could not gain. SAGUARO ROW rated close up and inside, angled out into the turn, forcing a rival to steady, saved ground
 on the two path, came through inside and had no stretch rally. CRAZY SWEET well placed and three wide, steadily lost ground.

 OLDZFOURFORTYTWO well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, gained a short lead late and lasted.
 JEN'S SONG allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain
 and missed. KITCHEN FIRE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the lane, then weakened late and held the show. TUDOX
 EXPECTATIONS tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. BEYOND
