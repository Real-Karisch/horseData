 Footnotes
 PREACHER'S BLUFF was outsprinted early, chased to the turn, came two wide with clear run to the stretch then pushed to the front in mid stretch and held
 driving. LITTLE JACK tracked the pace early, was two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked by the winner to mid stretch but dug in late to hold the
 place. OUTTHINK'EM was also outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then could only pick off rivals in the drive. BOLEO trailed to the turn, was
 three wide to the stretch then got outfinished in the final furlong. HONG KONG COWBOY pressed the pace to the turn, was outrun while three wide to the
 stretch then weakened. YES I'M WILD hustled to the front, edged away on the turn but tired in upper stretch and gave way. EDDIE COULD GO was chasing
 to the turn but had to circle rivals five wide to the stretch and came up empty in the drive. BRAVE TIMES had no speed and was not a factor. DEER
 DECARCHY stalked the pace to the turn while five deep but stopped in upper stretch, was eased but walked off.
