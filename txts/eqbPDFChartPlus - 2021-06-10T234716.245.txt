 Footnotes
 STAYONTHEGRIND lost footing and bobbled at the start, regrouped quickly, looped the field past the quarter pole and won off as tons the best in the
 stretch with little urging. GATTO ROSSO good position early, shuffled back into turn, angled widest for the stretch run and finished well to just garner the
 place spot. VERITAS pressed pace to deep stretch, lost the place spot in a blanket photo on the wire. RAF came over early, tightened up rival, vied on the
 lead but weakened in the drive. KOOL PATRIOT came out start, no speed to turn, came wides into the stretcht to move up late. LOVE YAMARI raced
 evenly, failed to respond when needed. SHARK steadied on rail just before half mile pole and backed up thereafter. DEL LA HOYA forced out at the start
 and showed brief foot but stopped.

 VIDA LEVA EU sharp break to lead while well rated, stayed clear drifting in the late stages. SOUR PEACH chased winner throughout with a mild late gain in
 the final sixteenth. DULCE DE LECHE well placed with a bid past the quarter pole and close the gap wide. RIDDLEMEREE unhurried early, bunched up into
 the far turn but flattened out late. WEDDING DAY KITTEN raced well off rail throughout while evenly and no bid in the stretch. ROYAL KNIGHTOWL was
 through after half dropped back. CAPE TIME saved ground to no avail. SPA ANGEL never a factor while galloping past the wire. RED SPOTS failed to
 menace and galloped past wire while far back.

 Footnotes
 JEWELISA perfectly placed to quarter pole, made a four wide run through the drive to get up in time. MUNCHIES behind leaders to far turn, rallied strong in
 the stretch run. CORA ANNE had no speed early on, rallied from inside through the drive for the show spot. VENEZUELANTREASURE with pace to far
 turn, garnered the lead into the stretch, battled hard but came up empty in the final sixteenth. BRITTANY'S BEAUTY had good speed, dueled to far turn but
 gave way readily thereafter. YES I'M EVIL never a real factor. RINGIN IN THE RAIN dueled to the half and gave way.
