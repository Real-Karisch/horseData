 Footnotes
 DR. HAL threw head at the start, rushed to good position backstretch, rallied outside in the final seventy yards and kicked in and finished fast to get up in
 time while tons the best. MACANAO chased pace to deep stretch but was outfinished and nailed on the wire. DUFFLE BAG good speed to deep stretch and
 grudging weakened in the late going in a game effort. CRASH GATE raced mid pack, steadied along early on backstretch while closing ground too late.
 FOREST WARRIOR unhurried throughout but improved in the late going. HOLD MY PURSE never far back, mild bid into turn but, weakened in the stretch
 run. SERAGLIO never a factor. GAME ON BRO through early, stopped. A COWBOY'S FIGHT through early, dropped back.
