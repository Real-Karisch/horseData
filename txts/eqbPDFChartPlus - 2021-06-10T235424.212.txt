 Footnotes
 NICE SURPRISE didn't break sharply, saved ground to the final turn, moved around distressed rival then swung very wide into stretch, took the lead near
 mid stretch and edged away. DIMENSION, very wide into and rounding the first turn, angled to the rail entering the backstretch, remained inside, challenged
 but couldn't match strides late. UNBRIDLED ROCKET broke slowly, moved up six wide on the backstretch, loomed near the stretch, faltered through the
 final furlong. ALTURIST, racing four wide while just off the pace, tired. ZIPPED CODE moved up racing wide then flattened out. RUNAWAY MISTRESS
 saved ground in second flight, also moved out to avoid distressed rival on the final turn and gave way. INFINITE FIESTA, fractious and in motion when the
 gates opened, raced very and showed little. NORTH OCEAN set the pace in the three path, went wrong leaving the backstretch and was euthanized.

 rider dropping his whip near the wire. CANDY PHIL, racing two wide, split rivals rallying and finished well. TIZ A KITTEN, two wide in second flight, lacked a
 strong closing kick. SURVIVE didn't break sharply, was hustled up along the rail then tired. ANISSA saved ground and never threatened. NO PICNIC broke
 slowly and showed little. NOTHIN BUT TROUBLE, very wide throughout, tired. BELLAMY CAT broke slowly then didn't threaten.

 PERFECT ICE moved up between rivals in upper stretch then closed along the inside rail to get up in the final 70 yards. MISSIN THE BIG DOG broke sharp
 to show the way then just lasted for second. SHANGHAI CHECK was prominent from the outset and finished willingly to just miss for the place. FINAL
 SHOT prompted the pace along the inside rail then faded. LITTLE SIETE lacked the needed rally. WON AND DONE failed to threaten. FIXEDINCOME
 LARRY tired from his early effort. SUCCESSFUL CURE prompted the pace for a half mile then tired. WINDOW TABLE showed little. JONAMAC stumbled
 at the start then was no factor. A claim of foul by the rider of FINAL SHOT against MISSIN THE BIG DOG for interference on the turn was not allowed by the

 LITTLE JIMMY, in tight rounding the first turn while inside, remained along the rail, repulsed repeated challenges and inched away. CHEDDAR CHUB,
 outrun racing just off the rail, drifted out in early stretch and was gaining. ARTISTIC DRIFTER broke slowly, saved ground, eased off the rail, challenged on
 the final turn but then weakened late. FLEET FIRST broke slowly, raced wide and passed faders. MATADOR, 'just off the rail and never far back, faded. WE
 B JAMMIN stalked the early pace outside winner, drifted out and tired. ROCKIN COWBOY, wide and just off the pace, dropped back steadily. KRAKEN
 GLACKEN, outside and just off the pace, fell back after six furlongs. CASTAWAY showed little.
