 SILVER DAHLIA was three wide and pressing the pace throughout, bid for the front as they turned into the stretch, had the front by the eighth pole and held
 safe driving. LET'S HAVE FUN was in mid pack and three wide throughout, came into range late on the turn and continued to close ground until the final few
 strides, clearly second but no threat to the winner. FRENCH CHARM bore in at the start, darted up inside to take the lead inside of two rivals, was stalked
 and pressed the entire trip, losing the lead by the eighth pole but staying on gamely. HIDDEN STARLET was between rivals and battling on the front end,
 stayed in the middle of them until the eighth pole when gradually fading back to hang on to a minor award. SAN NICOLA STAR hit the gate and broke in at
 the start, chased in behind the three leaders and was hustled to close the gap late on the turn but could not make a dent in the deficit. SILENT CHARITY
 raced in mid pack and in the two path, was roused by the rider midway on the turn but could only run evenly down the lane. I AM I SAID was wide at the
 back early, came two to three wide around the turn but could only pass a tired foe late. KISSY BEAR was bumped by a rival at the start, fell back to off the
 pace and mildly rallied around the turn but could not sustain it in the stretch. MISS MENE leapt up at the start spotting the field multiple lengths, then trailed
 for the most part without making a move of any kind.
