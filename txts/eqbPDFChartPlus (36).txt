 Footnotes
 VIBRANCY four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
 steadily gaining on a once clear leader through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to prevail. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON five then four wide in
 closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to take over command at the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing,
 swung four wide for home, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat to the outside and was caught in the final strides while
 well clear of the rest for the place honors. HARD WON six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased four wide through the turn placed to
 coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered five to six wide at the head of the stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. SAFFRON GIRL just off the inside in
 pursuit, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under a drive at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
 SHINE LIKE BOBBY five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung four wide for home and made no impact. WICKED
 KHEISHA broke in awkwardly and a bit sluggish at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased two to three wide from near the rear under a
 ride from midway on the turn, spun three wide for home and was unable to make an impact. ROMA CARPE established the front shortly after the start and
 showed the way in hand four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path half a mile from home, came under urging when displaced
 from the front at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and folded.

 Footnotes
 EXCESS CAPACITY at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, stalked the pace three wide on the turn, was in hand moving when ready as the
 half was being completed, had the pilot apply some pressure on the right side getting guided into the five path heading for the three-sixteenths marker, was
 given her cue, drew out to a very healthy margin before being geared down in the last seventy yards. COOL AS YOU LIKE away without apparent mishap,
 underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, was fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, went on to finish a non-threatening second. MOVIE
 SCORE took up the chase from the two path, going about her business from between opponents on the turn, came under a drive by the five-sixrteenths
 pole, with all but the eventual winner also being set down within the next few jumps, went into the lane and had no rally. PURELY LUCKY vied for control
 from path two, yielded to the top one despite getting asked for more right after the half had been reeled off, backed away steadily down the stretch. EVAN'S
 NICE NOW put to brisk encouragement until a half panel into the contest, saved ground to the quarter pole, tipped out three wide heading home, had no
 offering.

 PORTOS four wide through the opening bend, settled four wide in pursuit from near the rear of the compact field, advanced into the far turn and tucked
 three wide, issued a challenge to the leader and took over command placed to light coaxing near the quarter pole, went six wide into upper stretch, went
 clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages to the wire. COWTOWN coaxed from the gate, raced two then three wide through the first turn,
 chased three then four wide coming under coaxing half a mile from home, went seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while well
 clear of the rest to be along second best. CALL ME LATER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through the first turn and down
 the backstretch, remained just off the rail through the far turn put to coaxing three furlongs from home coming under steadily increased pressure, got
 displaced from command prior to spinning three wide into upper stretch, tired in the drive while along for the show honors. FIAT LUX coaxed from the gate,
 chased two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced mildly to briefly latch on that rival midway down the backstretch, came under light coaxing at
 the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. FEELING DANGEROUS coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first
 turn, chased three to four wide down the backstretch until tucked to the inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing just off the inside at the
 seven-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 COLTANDMISSISSIPPI took up position in the two path after the start, flashed interest as the half was being completed, swung to the outside heading for
 the top of the stretch, challenged in earnest from path four at the three-sixteenths pole, out-dueled WIN WITH PRIDE during the ensuing furlong, edged
 away then held well late to stay in the clear. HARDCORE FOLKLORE gently pinched in the shadow of the starting gate, took up the chase from path two on
 the turn, fanned out into path seven from upper to midstretch, rallied with some willingness for the place. WIN WITH PRIDE stalked the pace three wide,
 issued a successful takeover after spinning into the lane, came under aim by the top one shortly afterwards, put up resistance until approximately a
 sixteenth to go before weakening into the show slot. CANDY PROMISES saved ground until the end of the bend, rallied mildly after shifting out two wide at
 the top of the lane. THOUSAND PERCENT tracked the pace from near the inside route, stepped into the lane, failed to gain ground appreciably. DEEP SEA
 four wide entering the turn, got sent out six wide exiting it, lacked a response. SEANOW was put to a firm hold after establishing control in short order,
 showed the way from the two path, was put to the test in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, yielded then steadily backed away. DARK N
 CLOUDY marooned five wide on the turn, tired.

 OTHER THINGS EQUAL nine paths off the inside down the backstretch as the field stretched out across the track, tucked five wide into the turn and
 advanced to stack outside a quintet and then a quartet at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths emerging from the scuffle in tandem
 with BEACHSIDE to his inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in dueling through the length of the drive with BEACHSIDE to his inside, the
 rider utilizing a pronounced near sided rein nearing the finish making light contact with the rider of BEACHSIDE and was up gamely to prevail on the wire.
 BEACHSIDE coaxed from the gate, chased four wide from mid pack down the backstretch until tucked inside at the half mile pole, advanced inside on a
 quartet at the three-eighths slipping up the open rail to take over command near the five-sixteenths, got placed to coaxing as the aforementioned foe ranged
 up outside nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch out of necessity as OTHER THINGS EQUAL tucked to his direct outside in the two
 path, dug in under a drive knocking heads through the length of the stretch clinging stubbornly to the front and fighting game along the inside but was
 ultimately collared in the very last jump. BAD GUY broke a half a step slow and lost his lane shortly after the start, tipped out to be ten paths off the inside
 down the backstretch, had OTHER THINGS EQUAL clear inside and tucked five then four wide at the half mile pole before making his way to the three path
 advancing on the front with three furlongs to go, got steadied losing the tight seam between MR. VINCENT and PAYNTER'S PRIZE at that station losing
 about two lengths of momentum, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show
 honors in a good effort. WAYNES FOOTSTEPS seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked three to four
 wide into the turn and advanced to stack outside a pair joined to the outside by the eventual winner near the three-eighths, got jostled and traded bumps
 with MR. VINCENT at that station as his lane tightened, got put to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and
 weakened. THE HONEST TOUN six paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tucked three wide at the half mile pole,
 tipped out to the four path placed to coaxing at the three-eighths as BAD GUY got forced to steady in front, went seven wide at the head of the stretch and
 passed tired rivals. PAYNTER'S PRIZE lunged at the break getting away awkward, chased just off the pace five wide down the backstretch before
 advancing tucked to the two path into the turn, ranged up inside a trio near the three-eighths taking brief command at that station before being headed by
 BEACHSIDE along his inside near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. TALENT SCOUT four paths off the inside down
 the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled out six wide into upper stretch and tired. SCRUTINIZE
 three wide in pursuit from near the rear, tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
 stretch and made no impact. MR. VINCENT hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide
 into the turn and came under challenge from a trio near the three-eighths jostled with WAYNES FOOTSTEPS closing a seam that forced BAD GUY to
 steady at that station, got overhauled from the front, faded through the latter portion of the bend and went five wide for home, then tired in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 SILVER SEEKER gained a short advantage after the field had been sent off and running, was maneuvered into a snugger fit along the inside route at the
 commencement of the run around the bend, showed the way, pressed by OPERATION ROSES from path two, settled in upper stretch and was switched
 over to stronger handling, kicked away during the remainder of journey leading up to the eighth pole, dug in well late to stay comfortably in the clear.
 FINANCIALSTABILITY stepped onto the turn from the four path, was angled one wider into the stretch, mustered up willingness during the drive to win the
 place. TEN TWENTY NINE fell back readily after being brushed off stride due to contact with JACK BO shorty after the start, tucked into the two path by the
 conclusion of the backstretch, continued as the trailer, got steered out towards six during the stretch run, rallied with courage to earn the show. OPERATION
 ROSES prompted the winner while two wide, undergoing it from between rivals for part of the trip on the turn, kept up its quest in earnest before weakening
 in the last eighth. BEBE BANKER forwardly placed three wide to upper stretch, backed away. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD pursued the front runners from path
 two in midpack, altered into the five path in two stages during the initial portion of the stretch, flattened out. HIGH COMMAND rode the rail, was getting
 roused cutting the corner into the stretch, came up empty. JACK BO brushed during the early stages, was three wide entering the turn and sent out five
 wide exiting it, gave way.

 Footnotes
 RIGHTDOWNGENTLEMEN settled into midpack on the backstretch, kept watch on the contested from the overland route on the turn, was asked for more
 spinning approximately six wide into the stretch, clawed his way towards the ones to catch, overhauled an embattled pair just inside the sixteenth pole then
 swiftly kicked away. HUDSON OVERPASS eased back into a stalking role early on the backstretch, sat within striking distance of the front runners while
 stationed in the four path, increased his presence during the final stages of the run around the bend, was turned loose spinning into the lane, went at it eye
 to eye with GRATTO SWING practically all the way from there to the wire, proved powerless to match strides with the winner late, but won the war for place
 honors. GRATTO SWING secured a prominent position after making light contact with DA BERG in the shadow of the starting gate, argued for the top from
 path two just about throughout, was put to a drive for the drive home,under attack by the second place finisher, was game to the end but had to settle for
 third. LORCAN hard ridden coming out of the gate, sparred three wide for command, came under a drive by the five-sixteenths pole, weakened in the final
 furlong. DA BERG brushed with another after coming out with its initial step, worked out a tuck into the two path by the half mile pole, was moved out into
 path four once in the stretch, made no impact. MIGHTY WIND came up empty after taking the inside route. EL SANGRU saved ground for the opening half,
 was maneuvered out six to seven wide for racing room from upper to midstretch, went on mostly improve position with a mild kick. BLESSED HONOUR
 took up the chase from the four path on the turn, got sent out slightly wider into the stretch, had no response. FREUDIAN ANALYST stepped onto the turn
 from the two path, failed to contend. NARCISSISTIC two wide in midpack, gave way.
