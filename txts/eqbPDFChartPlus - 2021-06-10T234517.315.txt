 Footnotes
 ROYAL CHATTER broke in some, set the pace inside a rival to the lane then drew clear under urging. GLORIOUS GREY broke inward, saved ground into
 the lane, gradually eased out and finished well. NOON a bit fractious in the gate, raced just off the inside turning for home, moved out in upper stretch and
 finished willingly. GEM DIGGER pressed the issue and weakened late. TOP LADY MARGIE well placed saving ground, lacked the needed stretch
 response. PROMISING WISH rank early, bid three wide turning for home and needed more. PERFECT AGAIN four wide into the clubhouse turn, lacked a
 bid then tired through the lane.

 flight between horses, shifted out on the turn, bid seven wide, closed well, gained late and earned place. CHELOKEE'S LEGACY was never far off the pace
 while racing outside, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and got up for show under strong urging. PRESIDENTIAL BIRD pressed the pace between
 horses to the turn and stopped. FLY PAPA FLY set a pressured pace to the turn and flattened out. PRIKATI broke slowly, saved ground, bid and came up
 empty.

 FORTIFIED EFFORT never far back and near the inside entering the lane, eased out slightly inside the eighth pole for a clear path with a rival to his direct
 outside, responded to left handed pressure and finished gamely while edging clear at the wire. OLDTOYTRAIN prompted the issue four wide, reached the
 front passing the furlong marker and responded willingly in the drive but could not match the top one through the closing yards in a good effort. BEAT THE
 HEAT stayed outside while forwardly placed, raced in the four path entering the stretch, was brushed then got up late for the show. OH BROTHER JACK
 moved up leaving the gate and pressed the issue between rivals, moved to the front on the turn and battled through the lane then weakened late.
 VERMILION SKY'S three wide and between foes down the backstretch, pressed the issue between rivals and weakened late. WAY OUT raced five wide
 turning for home and offered a late gain. IFIWANTTO was outrun and five to six wide into the stretch. NEHEMIAH moved up leaving the gate and vied inside
 then weakened on the turn. ERGO dropped back leaving the gate and failed to menace.

 leaving the chute, showed the way to the lane and responded willingly through the stretch run then was run down late. MADAME CLOUET tracked saving
 ground, chased through the lane and lacked the needed late response. SHOELESS JACKSON well placed early, bid on the far turn, drifted some into the
 lane then needed more while finishing in a dead heat for the show. LUCK OUT broke outward and checked making contact with a rival, saved ground and
 lacked a late bid. DIAMOND CUT raced in the four path entering the stretch and had no rally. BEAR FACTS bumped at the start, was five wide entering the
 lane and had no stretch bid. FRIED PICKLES was bothered and bumped at the start, trailed and had no response. JOHN LOUIS' MARQ raced up close
