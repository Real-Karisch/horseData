 the late surge of E J'S LEGACY while having to settle for second best. BALDONNEL Bumped with the winner at the start, saved ground well placed,
 continued inside in the lane to earn a share but was no match for the top pair. SEEKING PAYMENT Was well placed along the three path around the
 corners and weakened outside. BENNY BIG BOY Five wide for a half mile, three path on the last turn and tired.
