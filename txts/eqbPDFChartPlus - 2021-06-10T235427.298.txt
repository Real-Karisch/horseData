 Footnotes
 WEB OF DEMONS showed the way to the lane and responded to urging then maintained a safe margin. RACING FOR CHASEN between rivals on the far
 turn, finished well and earned the place. CALL YOUR BLUFF prompted the early issue, chased turning for home and needed more. TRULY UNUSUAL
 saved ground, raced off the inside into the stretch and lacked the needed bid. DIAMOND CUT forwardly placed from the outside, was asked for run on the
 far turn and lacked the needed response. MISERABLE BLUE saved ground while up close and tired through the lane. LULU'S BEST stumbled badly at the
 start nearly unseating the rider, raced far back and was not urged through the lane.

 ROSAT stalked the pace outside, challenged four across on the turn, got a head in front and drew clear inside the sixteenth pole under mild left handed
 urging. BOILER PLATE vied inside past the sixteenth pole, yielded grudgingly and finished second best. VALLEY WILDCAT vied between horses, faltered
 near the eighth pole and held safely for show. TIZJOHNDEERSWAY vied three across, angled out near the eighth pole, fell back and leveled off. GOLD
 BRIDLE broke slowly and was crowded at the start, angled out at the top of the stretch, bid six wide and came up empty. THIRTY OTT SIX was never far
 back, lacked a bid and was outrun. MAGIC WOLF showed brief speed, dropped back and had no further response. CAUSE FOR EVICTION bobbled at the
 start, was rank to the turn and not urged through the stretch.

 TON EIGHTY forwardly placed in the run down the backstretch, took over from the outside on the far turn and quickly drew clear, widened into midstretch
 and was kept to the task until the late stages. FIRST TO THE WIRE broke out and in close early, was steadied off heels nearing the lane, raced six wide
 into the stretch and finished well while earning the place. SEEKING BEA bobbled at the start then steadied leaving the gate when bothered, bid along the
 inside in the lane and just missed earning the place. BOBBY BABY was steadied when bothered and forced in leaving the gate, raced just off the inside into
 the lane and lacked a late bid. RISKY VENTURE between rivals early, vied for the lead and tired in the drive. COOL HAND LUCAS raced seven wide into
 the stretch and had no solid rally. SUPER SWISS never far back and just off the rail turning for home, lacked a stretch bid. BUGGY BROWN came in at the
 start crowding rivals, vied inside and tired in the drive. HIS WAY three wide, vied for command on the backstretch, raced farther out turning for home and
 tired.
