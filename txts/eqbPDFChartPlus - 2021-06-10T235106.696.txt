 Footnotes
 HOPEFUL ANGEL, away in good order and forwardly placed, closed outside the top two and ran down the leader in the final furlong then edged clear.
 PRINCESS ROSE moved to the inside when clear early to set the pace then was not good enough for the winner. WITH WINGS raced in close pursuit then
 lacked the needed closing response. SASSY HUMOR failed to be a threat. A PRINCESS SHE IS moved closer into the far turn then lacked a further
 response. GEORGIA BONNET showed little. SARA'S LAST DANCE tired. SWEET SUMMER STAR was outrun.

 Footnotes
 KINGSLAYER, just behind top flight, moved closer to the rail final turn, rallied to the lead in early stretch, opened a clear advantage and won under strong
 handling. MOVIE NIGHT, unhurried saving ground, continued along rail rallying and gained place. SIR RAY, between top flight, weakened slightly. LOVE
 AND CARE set the early pace in the three path, drifted out entering the stretch and faded late. UNTO THOU, very wide, found best stride too late. ALAN'S
 LEGACY, three wide in top flight, tired. SPEIGHTMAN, far back, never threatened. MY COTTON JONES broke in a tangle, went wrong on the final turn and
 was euthanized.

 NATALIE LA ROSE broke sharp to be well placed just off the top two then closed gamely to run down the leader and prevail. TRIPOCHA was unhurried
 early then finished gamely near the inside to close the gap. APPEALING MISS dueled for the lead from the outset then faded in deep stretch. DAN'S GIRL
 dueled for the lead along the inside then faded in the drive. HOT SPICE GIRL failed to menace with a late stretch bid. HERSISTERISACHUB was away
 alertly to be forwardly placed and lacked the needed rally. THATTA BOY GIRL weakened.

 QUASANTE saved ground, took the lead near stretch, drifted slightly soon after and then drew off. IGNITE broke slowly, saved ground, eased out near the
 quarter pole but then was steered back to the rail and gained place. FRISKY WHISKEY, racing in the three path while just off the pace, faded late. THUMP,
 just off the rail, was in a bit tight on the backstretch, drifted out on the turn and tired. PERSUASIVE GIRL, wide and just off the pace, tired. CRAZY DAISY,
 between foes prompting the pace, drifted out on the turn and gave way. KENTUCKY DANCER, two wide, failed to menace. ONE TOUGH ANGEL set the
 pace in the three path, stopped suddenly and was being pulled up through deep stretch.

 THESE BLUES, outrun early, moved up between foes and then was left with rail on the final turn, waited briefly for racing room near stretch, split rivals
 rallying and took the lead in deep stretch. KLAATU, just off rail in second flight, eased out near stretch, took the lead, drifted slightly and gave way
 grudgingly. SO KITTEN was well placed just off the rail and finished willingly. ATHELSTANE, two wide in second flight, drifted out entering the stretch and
 finished well in a nice try. CAR FIFTY FOUR, wide, rallied too late. KOAN, just off the rail, failed to menace. CLEAR PROSPERITY vied for command just
 off the rail then tired. MR. ROMANCE, wide, showed little. GRIT'N'GRIND wasn't a threat. SWEET BABY JONES dueled for command two wide before
 stopping.

 Footnotes
 LUNA D'AVRIL bumped TRUE SWEETHEART in the opening furlong, and then raced in tight quarters between foes through much of the backstretch,
 moved out three wide, took the lead and won with speed to spare. VEBLEN GOOD saved ground just off pace, fell back after a quarter, swung wide and
 was clearly second best. AIRBORNE RANGER eased out after a quarter mile, raced four wide into stretch and then tired. MY MUSIC bobbled while
 breaking slowly, raced wide and failed to menace. I AM ON MY WAY, bumped in the opening furlong, set the pace three wide, tired. THEA'S REIGN saved
 ground and failed to menace. GIA ALEXA lunged and broke awkwardly, raced wide and failed to menace. HASTY NIC showed nothing. TRUE
 SWEETHEART ducked in in the opening furlong, was wide and just off pace then tired.
