 Footnotes
 GOODOLDTIMES (IRE) stalked the pace most of the way, rallied up the hill heading for the final been when he took command heading into the straight and
 then kept widening his margin after over the last fence. CURVEOF STONES settled mid pack made his move at the same time as the winner but was no
 match but definetly second best. DAPPER DAN settled in towards the back started to pick up rivals going down the hill on the final circuit, continued to gain
 modest ground heading up the hill towards the final bend then flatten out from there. JACK SLADE (IRE) set the pace from the beginning, still held sway on
 the final bend then retreated. OTHER CHEEK raced evenly towards the back, started to fall back from there in the final stages and was pulled up before the
 last jump and walked off. MERCOEUR (FR) was in contention for the first two circuits and then weakened on the backside for the final time and was pulled
 up two fences from home and walked off. COCODIMAMA was never in the race and was pulled up five out with almost a circuit to go and walked off.

 slight advantage jumping the last then drew clear at the wire. LONELY WEEKEND was close to the pace for the first mile, then casually got up to stalk the
 pace heading down the hill on the final circuit, kept up his momentum on the backside and battled hard coming out of the final bend and dueled over the last
 two fences but weakened in the final strides. EMERALD ROCKET (IRE) settled midpack, rallied on the backside for the final time to be in contention leaving
 the home turn then weakened through the stretch. WITHOUTMOREADO (IRE) failed to menace. CHOKLITCOVERDONUT never a threat. YOU'RE NO
 BETTER (GB) took over command on the backside for the first time, maintained that a slight lead dueling with two rivals through the stretch and heading to
 the last when he made a big mistake losing his rider at that jump and walked off. SUDDEN VICTORY was in contention when he fell three fences from
 home and walked off. GOLD SHIELD raced towards the back when he jumped the third last and then fell over the faller SUDDEN VICTORY and walked off.

 got in contention going up the hill heading for the home turn, got in the mix with the two front runners at the second last and dueled with those rivals over the
 last but then was outrun to the wire. MACCABEE was never far back, rallied on the home turn to be in striking distance but then could not gain further
 ground. IRANISTAN pressed the pace the intire way, hooked up with the leader coming into the stretch and dueled with that rival to the last fence then
 weakened. LETHAL STEPS (GB) raced midpack and was never a threat. ELECIDATION (IRE) was in contention until going up the hill for the final time then

 Footnotes
 FAMILY TREE (GB) was always in striking distance, rallied coming off the home turn to get to the lead two fences from home and widened that margin at
 the wire. CALDBECK (GB) was never far back rallied on the final bend, dueled briefly with the winner but was no match but held on for second. OUR
 LEGEND (IRE) lagged early then got within striking distance on the backside for the final time, rallied heading into the home stretch to battle for the second
 spot but couldn't quite make it. SPORTSWEAR (GB) had command early, gave that up and raced evenly midpack the rest of the way. BERCASA (IRE) was
 through after a mile and a half, fell back and no threat. BODES WELL (IRE) raced mid pack, rallied up the hill for the final time then retreated. ZANZI WIN
 (FR) was always in striking distance rallied coming off the final bend to duel with the winner, they were head and head going to the last when he made a
 terrible mistake jumping the last losing his rider. SKYDIVING was never in the mix and was pulled up before the last jump. KNOCKHOLT trailed throughout
 and was pulled up before the second last fence.
