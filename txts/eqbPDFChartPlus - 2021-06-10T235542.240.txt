 Footnotes
 BOSS DIXIE vied for the early lead inside, took off leaders into the backstretch, tipped three wide outside the leaders, bid three wide at the quarter pole,
 drifted in a bit in upper stretch, dueled and prevailed late. ICE MUSIC dueled outside, drew off passing the five-sixteenths pole, challenged by the winner in
 upper stretch, battled on gamely but was bested late. KID TEJANO chased three wide, urged passing the half mild pole and made a mild gain in the stretch.
 RUFEELINGLUCKY dropped back into first turn, saved ground, gained on rail into the stretch and weakened late. WE BE BURNIN dueled between rivals
 around the first turn and tired into the stretch. RIGHT ON MUNICH was void of early speed and never contended.

 Footnotes
 SOLO DRINK perfect position throughout, rallied in the stretch while all out to win the head bob on the wire. FALLS ROAD was bothered at the start, rushed
 to have good position to the far turn, came with a wide run but lost the head bob on the wire in a game effort. LUCKY LOOKIN showed good speed, dueled
 to the far turn and weakened grudgingly to the wire . ETERNAL POWER dueled on the lead to deep stretch, faltered in the final furlong. RUSSIAN TO
 TAPIT never reached contention and failed to make a bid in the drive. PAYROLLMAKER with the pace three wide to the half, had enough and faded back.
 RUE DE MUSIQUE turned in a dull effort while far back in the stretch and subsequently vanned off.

 SHE'S A FINE LINE dueled inside, forged clear lead into stretch, pulled away in hand, driven to wire. LOVE TOTEM dueled two wide, was outpaced by the
 winner into the stretch and held 2nd. SOHNI stalked behind leaders, faltered to the three path around the far turn, regained her stride and stayed on to gain
 a small share. E Z BONUS chased three wide up close, was urged along to bid for the lead around the far turn, went four wide in upper stretch and
 weakened. CHOCOLATE CHERRIES always trailed.
