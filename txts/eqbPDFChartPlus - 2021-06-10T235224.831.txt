 Footnotes
 RACHELGOTSTEPHEN was settled along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane to split foes challenging for command and drove clear.
 MARY JEANS WILDCAT, unhurried between foes in the opening stages, angled four wide racing into the lane while advancing to challenge and was just
 outkicked. SWEET ANNIE CAT, forwardly placed three deep, pressed the issue to upper stretch and gave way. SEPTEMBER SURPRISE vied for
 command inside foes from the outset to upper stretch, then gave way. HOOSESSENTIAL settled outside foes, never gained contention. ANNIE TIME GIRL,
 urged to terms prompting a rival's pace, dueled between foes on the turn and gave way.

 Footnotes
 GLITTERATI GAL, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace in the opening half, engaged that rival in a prolonged drive and narrowly prevailed under strong
 handling. MISS GALILEE, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival to gain a narrow advantage into the backstretch, grudgingly resisted to the end but came
 up second best. HERO ALEXANDRA tracked the pace outside a rival in second flight and edged that foe for a share late, then was observed to have bled
 following the race. SUPERDYNE tracked just off the leaders inside a rival in second flight, then faded into the lane. DIXIE LEE ATTACK settled inside rivals
 in the last flight early and never gained striking distance. TULALIP settled between foes in the last flight and offered no rally. SPECIAL CONQUEST settled
 outside foes and proved no threat while drifting five wide into the stretch.

 Footnotes
 SMOKE 'N' GLOAT broke sharply to gain the advantage, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a comfortable margin into the turn and continued willingly
 to hold safe the challenge of GORGEOUS GEORGE under firm handling. The latter gained a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, continued with
 a steady bid to challenge that foe into upper stretch but was outfinished. CALL THE COLONEL settled along the inside early, saved ground to upper stretch
 and gained some position late. DANDY GAL tracked the leaders three deep in the opening stages, made brief progress in that path into upper stretch but
 flattened out late. SPEIGHTSONG hopped at the start, then was caught in a bit tight in the opening stages and failed to menace thereafter.

 Footnotes
 BOOHOO SUE broke sharply, dictated the pace along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch but held sway to the end under firm right
 handed pressure. AWAY SHE GLOWS, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, was eased back from that position entering the turn,
 angled to the rail, was urged to challenge inside the winner near midstretch but came up second best. LAKE SNOW ducked out at the start bumping a rival,
 gained position inside foes racing into the turn, switched out three wide in upper stretch and finished evenly late. SERENA'S HALO, bumped at the start,
 settled along the inside early and made an effort to improve position inside foes. SEATTLE TRAIN broke slowly, settled outside foes, swung five wide racing
 into the lane to gain some position but had no final kick. SASSY AND REGAL tracked off the second flight between foes to the turn but lacked the needed
 late response. CATHERINE EUGENIA tracked the pacesetter three wide in second flight to the turn and faded into upper stretch. R FOUR O ONE K tracked
 off the second flight four wide in the opening stages and soon faded.

 Footnotes
 ANTALYA tracked the pacesetter from out of striking distance three deep in the opening stages, conceded some position to the leader through the
 backstretch, was urged to advance three wide racing into upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage and go clear under
 firm handling. UNTRUTHFUL SONNET settled off the second flight early, shifted out four wide racing into the lane and produced her best stride late to
 prevail for the place honors. SUREIS angled inwards to track inside rivals in second flight to the far turn, was urged to bid between foes in tandem with the
 winner near midstretch but had no final kick. MONGOLIAN TIME tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn but lacked a rally. ZENA RULES
 was a brief factor outside rivals in second flight, but faded nearing the lane. TRACK MAGIC, reserved last early, angled five wide racing into upper stretch
 but made no impression. NIFTY NELLIE tracked the pace between foes in second flight but faded early. MISS DEVINE broke awkwardly, gained a position
 tracking inside rivals in second flight to the backstretch but faded early.

 ACROBATIC ALLY broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin into the turn and held sway to the end under right handed
 pressure while drifting out markedly in late stages. DOGGERWINII tracked the leader inside rivals in second flight into the turn, shifted out three wide in
 upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for second late. DARLIN ROSIE, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter between foes, made steady
 progress to challenge the winner near midstretch, then altered inside that rival late while losing the place honors. ROMANCIN N DANCIN ducked out at the
 start bumping GREELEY'S ANGEL, settled into stride, switched out three wide racing into the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. POSH
 RULER tracked the pacesetter three wide in second flight and steadily faded into upper stretch. B N A NATIVE GIRL broke inwards bumping GREELEY'S
 ANGEL, was collected to track off the second flight, but offered no rally. GREELEYS ANGEL, knocked back at the start, proved no threat. CHIQUE TO
 CHIQUE was settled outside foes early and failed to menace. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF DARLIN ROSIE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
 AGAINST THE WINNER WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

 V J'S BET angled inwards in the opening stages attending a rival's pace, made steady progress to take over racing past midstretch under pressure, then
 was taken in hand late once the issue was decided. GHAALEB'S APPEAL tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening quarter, sifted three wide
 nearing upper stretch while moving to challenge for command, proved no match for the winner late but edged a rival for the place honors. SUZ, was urged
 to the lead along the inside, dueled for command into upper stretch and weakened late. FEISTY CHI CHI tracked off the second flight between foes in early
 stages, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch, then angled nearer the inside late while finishing evenly between foes. TUMULTUOUS GAL tracked off
 the second flight outside foes to the turn, but lacked a rally. VENUS SERENA tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, then gave
 way in late stages. BELLE BREZING settled near the inside in the opening stages and failed to menace.
