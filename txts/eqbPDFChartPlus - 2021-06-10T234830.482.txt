 Footnotes
 EXPLOSIVE CANDY moved up shortly after start to take control of lead, remained on top under three wide drive holding firm then held off late charging
 POISON ART in final strides. POISON ART hustled up between runners at start then steadied to last in initial sixteenth, waited under snug hold, gathered
 outside momentum through the turn, swung out wide losing ground then kicked in willingly, gained fast just ran out of time. PROPER PRINCESS raced up
 close off top two leaders then steadied along inside leaving backstretch, sat on hold at quarter pole then set down for drive, gained between then angled in
 and continued trying to wire. AWESOMENDENSOME was forwardly placed from onset, chased willingly along outside into lane, raced in striking range then
 yielded in final stages. SIENA SLEW came away last then moved to outside and steadily advanced to gain contending position mid-turn, roused for more
 top stretch, responded, continued driving in contention then got in tight and steadied late. FAR FROM HERE broke sharp on top then quickly lost lead to
 eventual winner, remained in up close pursuit along inside into lane then came up empty in final furlong.

 Footnotes
 ULTIMATE DUDE slightly bobbled at start then angled to inside, sat off top two leaders awaiting cue, angled out top stretch, moved up to engage SIN
 LLORAR for lead, took command past eighth pole and finished clear. SIN LLORAR up easily to lead at start then came under pressure from TWISTCAT
 CANDY, continued to hold narrow lead over rival still unasked through turn, put to drive top stretch, challenged by ULTIMATE DUDE past furlong marker,
 could not move on with rival but remained in pursuit holding runner up spot. TWISTCAT CANDY quickly moved up to apply outside pressure to SIN
 LLORAR, remained in pursuit just off rival, came under ride in turn, could not continue up close top stretch but kept in range along outside then evened in
 late drive. WATHNAN raced outside in last flight, took closer order in the turn, wandered outside despite right handed pressure, moved in few paths late but
 needed kick to move by. ON CRUISE CONTROL was off step slow at the start then remained along inside in late flight, was never far back then angled out
 in stretch but remained evenly to the end. MEXICAN LUCKY slightly hopped at start then hustled up between rivals, checked back sharply past three
 eighths pole and lacked response after. ONE CLASSY DUDE trailed in the back throughout.

 CHARLIE'S SECRET drifted out at start then dueled along outside of ONE DIRECTION SONG, continued to match strides into lane, asked for more,
 responded and edged away to clear lead in final furlong. ONE DIRECTION SONG dueled along inside of CHARLIE'S SECRET just after start, continued to
 match strides along inside into stretch, could not move on with eventual winner in final furlong, settled for second best. SWEET DEAL tracked the top two
 clear leaders while racing clear over rest, roused for more running through turn, kept in outside pursuit, could not reach top pair but was clearly best of rest.
 PRINCESS AKRIS veered out at start, continued along outside lacking early speed, finished far off top trio while well clear over rest. UNO CITA lacked early
 speed, raced far off pace and failed to move into range. MARE IRISH DANCER stumbled to nose at start then got bumped coming back up, steadied, lost
 momentum and failed to move into range. SWEET POINT saved ground, failed to respond.

 R PAPER CHASER took commanding lead at start, kept on top saving ground still unasked in turn, was shaken up for drive, kept on with GO ASTRAY not
 far behind, put to left handed drive, lost whip near eighth pole, kept under strong hand rousing and held in final stride. GO ASTRAY hustled up at start and
 moved in bit closer from outside position, continued bid for R PAPER CHASE into lane, moved out path late, finished with kick and just missed, finished
 clearly second best. FORTY KILOS bumped gate at start then hustled up for lead, raced in close range then lost ground off top lead in turn, moved off
 outside, remained in pursuit and held show. ARABELLA BELLA lacked early speed and raced well off early speed, kept under steady urging then angled
 inside for stretch drive, improved just missed show. MINAJ was sent hard at start but lacked early foot and continued near the back, saved ground entering
 lane then lacked needed rally to gain contention. BIKINI HOTTIE was off step slow then steadied, raced in back and offered no late run.

 Footnotes
 DOMINATE was taken to settle in early stages, continued between rival at half mile marker, steadily advanced closer in far turn then was set down for drive,
 took over lead approaching eighth pole and remained clear. STARSHIP ZORRO was rated off early pace, made move midway through far turn, continued
 between runners past quarter pole, angled out upper stretch, responded when put to drive and produced solid finish for runner up spot. ZIPI ZAPE was
 taken back to last and continued unhurried through backstretch, made quick outside move running through far turn, circled eight wide into stretch, kicked in
 and quickly moved in striking range then yielded in deep stretch. FAN BASE moved up after opening quarter to challenge EL CACHACO for lead, dueled
 along outside of rival through far turn, dug in and held narrow lead top stretch then lost lead to eventual winner, kept on just missed show. INAVANTI raced
 in contention under snug hold through backstretch, saved ground along rail, cut corner entering lane then moved out few paths, showed response, gained
 position then finished evenly. BRITANNIA'S MOAT tracked five wide through backstretch, roused for response near the quarter pole, came out six to seven
 wide then failed to kick on. VEDELAGO (IRE) raced four wide in first turn, kept along in range through far turn, was set down for drive but failed to sustain
 bid through late stages. EL CACHACO ran off on top in opening quarter then settled and dueled along inside for lead, continued to match strides through far
 turn, cut corner then gaveway.

 LITTLE BALTAR secured inside position in first turn and continued stalking top two leaders saving ground along rail, kept up close, cut corner entering top
 stretch then came off inside, moved back in then angled to outside of CHARLIE MOPS, finished game and got nose in front at wire. CHARLIE MOPS
 secured inside position running through first turn then set pressured pace throughout backstretch, dueled with FORCE through far turn, edged away from
 rival top stretch, held narrow lead, fought gamely to wire, got nipped in final stride, good effort. HAMMERS TERROR sat back off early pace, roused for
 more in far turn, continued urging into upper stretch, only produced mild response then found another gear in final furlong, surged to wire. ADIOS NARDO
 was bit keen in early going then settled into outside stalking position, put to drive near quarter pole, evened bit upper stretch then found more and kept on to
 wire. FORCE pressed pace through backstretch, dueled long outside of CHARLIE MOPS in final turn, could not match strides top stretch but remained in
 close contention then gaveway in final furlong. DONATION was unhurried and settled in nicely off pace, came under right handed urging leaving far turn,
 raced wide upper stretch, moved closer in with response but was not enough for late impact. IT'S A GIVEN was bit rank tossing head up leaving first turn,
 quickly settled and saved ground, cut corner entering lane, lacked needed kick top move on. CHRISHI raced in the back, failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 CAPE DYNASTY steadily advanced position to reach leader at half mile marker, dueled along outside of ARPINELLA into lane, dug in gamely from outside,
 edged away late. ARPINELLA held clear lead in opening quarter then came under challenge at half, dueled along inside of CAPE DYNASTY into lane,
 fought back gamely then lacked needed kick in final sixteenth. HOUSE ACCOUNT was rated off top flight in backstretch, picked up pace in far turn,
 continued three then two wide bid through lane clearing show. LEROY'S IMAGE moved up four wide near lead at half mile marker, could not move on with
 top pair in final turn but remained in contention then gaveway in lane. GOLDEN AWAY was hard to handle in first turn, wanted to get out and moved
 outside, straightened and settled through backstretch, came out in turn then moved in racing two mid-stretch but lacked needed kick to move on. EYE OF
 THE LION moved up three wide near lead at half mile marker, failed to sustain bid in far turn, dropped back. STAY AGAIN raced off the pace, saved ground
 on inside entering lane then lacked needed rally. SIORNO raced in range, hustled up along inside in late backstretch then retreated near three eighths pole.

 Footnotes
 WILDCAT WAVE sped to lead at start, angled inside to save ground, continued clear on top into lane then held off WALKING PRIMROSE under driving
 finish. WALKING PRIMROSE (FR) raced up close along rail, came under left handed drive upper stretch, moved outside and continued closing in to wire.

 REINA raced near mid-range along outside, hustled up along outside leaving turn, produced wide bid in lane gaining ground in final furlong. ATLANTIC
 GUSTO raced in close pursuit of pacesetter, continued willingly chase after rival into lane then steadily weakened. BULL EMPRESS raced along inside off
 early pace, raced widest of all in lane, gained ground but was not enough for late impact. TOUCH OF QUALITY was stubborn to load then lacked speed
 near the back, failed to move into threatening range. FLASHY VAL was awkward at start, raced midpack along outside, kept in range then gaveway in lane.
 DIXIE GRITS raced up close in early going then steadily lost ground. LADY LYDIE raced off early pace then came out wide entering top stretch. THE RED
