 Footnotes
 BLESSED SONG stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the drive, responded
 when asked and wore down OH DEAR LORD the final furlong. OH DEAR LORD broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the
 backstretch, shook loose at the eighth pole but could not last. D'WILD MUFFIN chased the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the
 backstretch, came six wide into the drive and could only hold position. ELLASHOO dueled from between foes early, remained engaged up the backstretch
 but could not keep pace in the drive. WILD FOR CATHRINE could only improve position. STAR TOO was no real factor. OUR SWEET SYDNI chased the
 early pace and tired. JUST KICKING BACK dueled from the outside and faded. WHY ME'S LEGACY showed little.
