 Footnotes
 GOLD HAWK came into the clubhouse turn in the three path, settled between horses at the rear of the path, chased in the four path into the far turn, went
 under a drive from the quarter marker, swung into the stretch in the six path, steadily ate away at URBAN COOL's lead through the final furlong, and caught
 that foe despite drifting out under the left handed stick. URBAN COOL sent to the lead, dictated terms in the two path through the first turn, took pressure
 from CANNES to his outside down the backside and into the far turn, turned that foe away past the seven sixteenths, continued leading in the two path
 through the second turn and into the stretch, opened up between the quarter and furlong poles, drifted out in the lane and was nailed at the wire. MONTANA
 KID settled three wide at the rear through the first turn and remained there through the backstretch run, advanced in the five path past the three eighths
 marker, turned into the stretch in the four path in striking range of the leader, but proved no match in the lane. CANNES stalked the pace in the four path on
 the first turn, gave URBAN COOL moderate pace pressure down the backstretch and into the far turn, pressed in the three path in that second turn, was
 rebuffed past the seven sixteenths marker, and faded from there. MINEYEROWNMALONE hit the gate, ran very rank in the clubhouse turn while along the
 rail at the rear of the pack, settled down into the backside and remained on the inside at the rear, failed to keep pace with the field past the half mile marker,
 faded in the three path around the turn and made no impact in the lane.

 Footnotes
 WIND CHILL FACTOR trailed the field but was never far off the lead, stayed on the rail through the turn then found a hole with a furlong to go, burst through
 and extended her lead through the finish. I FORGOT IT'S NAME had a clear lead while staying on the rail, edged clear after getting collared at the quarter
 pole but was outfinished by the closer. DESERT IMAGE hit the gate at the start but recovered and got up to chase the pace on the inside, went two wide
 around the turn with a rally but was no match. SHOWERSOFBLESSINGS got in tight at the start and stayed in close quarters through the backstretch,
 chased the pace between horses going three wide then lacked a rally when asked for more. DESERT THIEF chased the pace going four wide around the
 turn then had no response.

 MAGIC MUSKETIER broke outward and hit the gate, got hung out in the five path into the clubhouse turn, tracked the pace a bit rankly three wide down the
 backstretch, raced in the five path in the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, bumped with BROTH when he tried to go through a hole too small
 near the three sixteenths marker, continued his rally, and got up just in time. DONIVAN MY BOY stalked the pace on the rail through the clubhouse turn,
 tracked inside down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, had no room to advance until a hole opened along the rail near the three sixteenths,
 slipped through, headed the leader past the furlong pole, continued under a drive inside, but got nipped at the wire. JIMMY D hit the gate, settled near the
 rear in the three path through the clubhouse turn, continued in an unhurried manner, was again in the three path through the far turn, angled out
 approaching the furlong pole, unleashed a stiff rally down the stretch, but just missed. NEXT MONDAY settled at the rear of the pack, raced in the four path
 through the clubhouse turn, continued to trail down the backstretch, hit the rail while saving ground through the far turn, rallied into the stretch but proved no
 match for top three. BROTH dwelt briefly at the break, walked out of the gate and came slowly into stride, chased the pace in the two path through the
 clubhouse turn and continued to chase the pace, improved into the stretch, attempted to split MAGIC MUSKETIER and GOLDEN DRAGON near the three
 sixteenths marker, but found a hole too small and got squeezed instead, instead swung to the far outside, and got going well enough late to pass tiring
 horses late. GOLDEN DRAGON tracked the pace in the four path through the clubhouse turn, made an early move near the three quarter pole to stalk
 outside RICHIESONARAMPAGE, continued stalking down the backstretch and in the far turn in the four path, bumped with BROTH near the three
 sixteenths when that one tried to go through too small a hole, and faded in the final furlong. RICHIESONARAMPAGE set the pace in the four path through
 the clubhouse turn, was stalked by GOLDEN DRAGON to his outside from the three quarters marker, continued to lead down the backstretch and through
 the far turn in the three path, and wilted once headed just past the furlong pole. SHO POKE tracked the pace in the two path through the clubhouse turn,
 tracked between horses along the backstretch, swung in the six path around the far turn, but could not muster a rally and faded out of contention. THERE
 WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. THERE WAS ALSO A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF BROTH AGAINST THE
 RIDER OF MAGIC MUSKETIER, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN. AFTER REVIEW, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE,
 RULING THAT BROTH CONTRIBUTED TO THE INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH.

 Footnotes
 GRITTY GREELEY stalked the pace two wide early, moved in tandem with MONTEZUMA EXPRESS to his outside to get a little closer to SHAK'EM UP
 past the half mile pole, stalked through the far turn, ranged up outside SHAK'EM UP approaching the quarter pole, came into the stretch in the three path as
 he headed that foe, edged clear in shallow stretch, and held safe to the wire. SHOTENOUGH TO POP broke inward and hit the gate, bumped SHAK'EM UP
 in the opening strides, chased the pace inside, saved ground through the far turn, came into the stretch in the three path behind horses, got space inside in
 the lane, got up for second between horses near the sixteenth pole, but proved no match for GRITTY GREELEY. OH OZ tracked the pace to the outside
 early, was urged along outside SHOTENOUGH TO POP near the seven sixteenths marker, split between that foe and MONTEZUMA EXPRESS near the
 five sixteenths, came into the stretch in the four path, fought on three wide into the final furlong but got outkicked for place. SHAK'EM UP was squeezed
 between SHOTENOUGH TO POP and TWO MINUTE MAN in the opening strides, was rushed inside to the lead after that trouble, carried a clear lead into
 the far turn, saved ground through the bend while taking pressure from GRITTY GREELEY, came into the stretch in the two path, and weakened inside
 down the lane. SMART ALEX'S POSSE came in to bump TWO MINUTE MAN in the opening furlong, settled near the rear, raced two wide through the far
 turn, swung into the stretch in the six path, but could not find enough of a rally to threaten. MONTEZUMA EXPRESS showed early foot, stalked the pace
 three wide once SHAK'EM UP rushed to the lead, moved in tandem with GRITTY GREELEY past the half mile pole to engage the leader, but began to stall
 out near the seven sixteenths marker, turned into the stretch in the five path, and faded. W W DISTINCTION settled at the rear, trailed well behind the field,
 turned for home in the three path, and passed a tiring foe. TWO MINUTE MAN broke inward, hit the gate, bumped SHAK'EM UP soon after the break, then
 was subsequently bumped by SMART ALEX'S POSSE, saved ground through the far turn, had no response when urged, and faded.

 Footnotes
 PEEJ broke inward then was content to trail the field while on the rail, stayed at the back through the backstretch, took the turn for home in the three path
 then angled out at the eight pole and rolled home from there. BROKEN KEY took the first turn in the two path while sitting well rated off the pace, began to
 creep forward on the backstretch and was forced to go five wide turning for home, uncorked a rally down the lane taking a brief lead with a sixteenth to go
 but was caught by the closer. CHAS THE MAN got squeezed at the start then elbowed through to take the early lead, quickly got a spot on the rail for the
 turn, got collared at the five eighths pole but quickly shrugged it off and shook clear, dug in when asked for more turning for home but as no match for the
 top finishers. ALL CALL broke awkwardly then was slow into stride, made up ground while sitting well rated off the pace, went around both turns in the two
 path then had a rail rally when asked for more. ARCH RIVALRY took the first turn on the rail while he stalked the pace while going two wide turning for
 home then finished evenly. DANCING ROCK went three and four wide around the turns, vied for the lead at the five eighths pole, lost some ground on the
 leader so was content to chase the pace then faded in the stretch. HE'S DANN GOOD tracked the pace on the inside then finished evenly. ALWAYS A
 CATCH went two wide around the first turn while stalking the pace, swung for home going four wide then weakened. HUSKY CLIPPER tracked the pace on
 the outside going three wide around the first turn then lacked the needed rally.

 Footnotes
 HINT TO WIN bobbled out of the gate, was bumped by FACE TO FACE in the opening strides, settled inside at the rear, improved from the seven
 sixteenths marker, sustained a rail rally though the far turn, came into the stretch in the two path, bulled through horses near the furlong marker, and fought
 to lead in time. VALID STORM brushed the gate, tracked the pace two wide, entered the stretch in the four path in striking range, made a three wide rally in
 the stretch, was bumped by HINT TO WIN when he squeezed through near the furlong marker, and found himself just outfinished by that foe. A J'S POSSE
 came in to lightly bump STORMY DON in the opening strides, was sent to press outside FACE TO FACE, dueled two wide through the far turn, came into
 the stretch in the three path, turned back FACE TO FACE into the final furlong, finished gamely but was just outfinished by the late runners.
 COMMANDER'S CASTLE chased the pace inside early, came out into the five path into the stretch, and showed interest to the wire four wide though
 proving no match for the top three. STEFAN O'EISHEN came in and grazed STORMY DON in the opening strides, settled near the rear inside, swung out
 into the six path for the stretch drive, raced with interest late to improve position, but proved not quite good enough. FACE TO FACE hit the gate, came
 inward to bump HINT TO WIN in the opening strides, was hustled to the lead, had pressure from A J'S POSSE to his outside down the backstretch, dueled
 inside through the far turn and into the stretch, was overtaken for good into the final furlong and flattened from there. ESPO tracked the pace inside down
 the backstretch, entered the stretch in the three path just behind the leaders, had clear sailing until he was squeezed badly when HINT TO WIN bulled past
 him near the furlong pole, and weakened. I FOUND A PENNY was reluctant to load, raced near the rear two wide early while rank, chased the pace on the
 turn in the five path while still rank, turned for home in the six path, and never factored. STORMY DON was bumped between STEFAN O'EISHEN and A J'S
 POSSE in the opening strides, soon trailed, entered the stretch in the five path, and never rallied.

 Footnotes
 WYNN TIME stalk the pace on the outside going four wide around the turn, was full of run picking off horses at the quarter pole, set down for the drive and
 edged clear while drifting in slightly because it was win time. ROCK CAN TOUR ducked in at the start and bumped with RICHIESGOTSWAGGER,
 shrugged it off and tracked the pace going two wide, swung into the four path turning for home and uncorked a rally down the lane. HARLANDAY ran
 towards the rear, swung for home in the four path and popped off a strong rally late in the stretch. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER bumped with ROCK CAN
 TOUR at the start but quickly recovered and scurried straight to the front and dueled for the lead on the inside, kept up the pace into the stretch while
 responding well when asked for more but his hole closed up with a furlong to go as WYNN TIME drifted in. DANNY B broke inward and slammed with
 BULLDOG OF BERGEN, recovered to stalk the pace on the inside, ran all out through the stretch and finished evenly. SAVEMETHELASTDANCE stalked
 the pace between horses while going two and three wide around the turn but weakened for the drive. BULLDOG OF BERGEN ducked out at the start and
 slammed into DANNY B, tracked the pace on the outside going three wide around the turn but lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT LEWIS dwelt in the gate then
 ducked in coming into stride and trailed most of the way until he passed an easing rival. SYNC O'PADDY dueled for the lead on the outside going two wide
 around the turn, stopped at the quarter pole and was eased.
