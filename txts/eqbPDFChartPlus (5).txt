 Footnotes
 MO LIGHT moved up three wide into the far turn to engage the top two then, after a long stretch drive, proved narrowly best. HEAVEN'S CREATION moved
 off the rail on the far turn to come four wide into the stretch and loomed boldly in the final furlong then just missed. TWEETING disputed the pace racing two
 abreast and gave way grudgingly. SKIP THE TALK saved ground vying for the lead then weakened in the drive. FRIENDS TALK dropped back on the far
 turn then was eased in the final furlong. ZERO N HERO dropped back on the far turn then was eased in the final furlong.

 Footnotes
 ARCHARELLA advanced outside rivals into the far turn and gained the lead in upper stretch then proved best under steady urging. AFLEET'S DIVIDEND
 was well placed just off the pace and responded well in the drive. SOPHIESHARDTOCATCH was checked on heels into the far turn where she became
 boxed then continued gamely to gain third. ANONYMOUS moved closer into the stretch then finished willingly. NERVE LINE quickly went to the front, saved
 ground setting the pace and faded in the drive. NEA rallied mildly. MARTHA'S VALENTINE prompted the pace then weakened in the drive. KANAKA lacked
 a solid rally. BLUSHING BIRD was through early. CUBAN ARGUMENT bobbled on heels soon after the start. A claim of foul by the rider of
 SOPHIESHARDTOCATCH against the winner for interference into the far turn was not allowed following a steward inquiry.

 DIXIE SPIRIT worked her way over to the inside early to set the pace and was kept to her task to prove clearly best. GALA'S BANK, away alertly and well
 placed, finished willingly for the place. INTRACTABLE was boxed around the far turn then closed between rivals to get up for third. MOVE OVER HONEY
 attended the pace then lacked the needed closing response. MISS OTIS, forwardly placed, lacked the needed rally. CRITICAL HUMOR was blocked in the
 final furlong. EYERISH INSPIRED moved closer around rivals on far turn then needed more. ON THE LIST showed little. STORMY PRINCESS tired from
 her early effort.
