 Footnotes
 ROOSTER J challenged for the early lead, drove clear and was kept to the task. BAYOU BANJO raced within striking distance, came around the turn four
 wide, couldn't catch ROOSTER J for the win, but got up for second. JUS MONDAYS raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn five wide, made a
 wide bid and finished willingly. RED NICK CARL dueled for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and weakened late. ROYAL TREE vied for the early
 advantage and faded, while finishing wide. NEIGHBOR'S OUTLAW lacked early speed, improved position, while racing wide, but was no factor. ELLA'S
 ACTOR broke in, pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn and faded. ZACTLY raced near the middle of the pack in the beginning and weakened.
 MICHELE'S MISTAKE steadied at the start, getting in tight quarters, finished wide and was never a threat. PRO TRIBUTE always raced near the back and
 showed little. TO FIELD LANDRY lacked early speed, trailed late and was outrun.
