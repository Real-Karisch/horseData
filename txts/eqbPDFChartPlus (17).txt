 Footnotes
 CAPTAIN CHATAIN stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the second turn, dueled through the
 drive and inched clear late. DOUBLE DOWN dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged entering the drive but could not
 match strides. LANDMAN forced the early pace from the outside, remained forward for the drive then just lasted for the show. FATHER GEORGE chased
 the early pace inside, responded entering the drive but was outfinished for the show. SHERMAESQUE FLAG could only improve position. HARD EARNED
 was steadied early and no factor. MR BIN chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, was steadied at the five eighths
 mark and finished belatedly. LOOTTOOL was no factor. RELENTLESS ATTACK forced the early pace and tired. LEVEL TEMPER dueled from the outside
 and gave way.

 Footnotes
 A SONG FOR ARCH well placed early from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, responded to duel through the drive and inched clear late.
 GARDNER'S SONG broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, remained clear through the turn, dueled with the winner but could not match
 strides. TAPSTER stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, responded along the rail and was just up for the show. GOTTA GO
 FIRST chased the early pace from the outside, made a bid entering the drive but was outfinished for the show. THECLASSPRAYER went evenly.
 MANOFSASS forced the early pace inside then tired in the drive. ALEX'S TURN forced the early pace and tired. RUN PECK RUN was never a factor.
 ZARGAUX was no threat. I HAVE NO QUE showed little.

 Footnotes
 BUSHIDO SAMURAI well placed from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn, remained forward entering the
 drive, drifted out mid stretch bothering FIRE BLASTER and was just up the final strides. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey's Objection, BUSHIDO
 SAMURAI was disqualified for interference in the stretch run. TAMMANY PARKWAY chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the
 second turn, altered outside for the drive, responded, drifted in bothering FIRE BLASTER and was outfinished for the win. After a Stewards' Inquiry and
 Jockey's objection TAMMANY PARKWAY was disqualified for interference in the drive in a rare double disqualification. FIRE BLASTER up close early from
 the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn, was bothered by both BUSHIDO SAMURAI and TAMMANY PARKWAY
 in the upper stretch then went evenly late. RED WINED UP six wide into the first turn, chased the early pace from the outside, responded and had a late
 rally. IT'S MIKE'S TURN went evenly. HALFFLATT broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch then tired in the
 drive. NO GAME FOR SISSYS was six wide into the first turn and no factor. BROWN'S MONKEY forced the early pace and faded. WHOAJOEY was never

 Footnotes
 SHE'SAGRACIOUSLADY well placed from the inside, inched closer up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, dueled through
 the second turn, gained the margin at the eighth pole and was clear late while kept to task. DROP DEAD RED close up inside early, chased the pace up the
 backstretch, dropped back slightly entering the second turn, lacked room at the eighth pole, split rivals deep stretch and was just up for the place. ALPHA
 SUE pressed the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced entering the second turn, responded and was just up for the show. CAUSE YOU CAN
 broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, dueled through the second turn then faded in the drive. GLIDE
 BABY GLIDE forced the early pace from the outside, made a bid entering the second turn but faltered in the drive. J J QUEEN could only pass tired ones.
 CROWN AND SEVEN was no factor. SOUL AFFAIR had a steady fade. SIBLING WAR forced the early pace and tired. PURELY BLESSED showed little.
