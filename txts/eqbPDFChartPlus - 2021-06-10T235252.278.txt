 Footnotes
 BRIDGET MOLONEY settled nicely stalking a pair of duelers, asked leaving the far turn, quickly moved up challenging TZI OUR DESTINY turning for home,
 drove clear in mid stretch and drew off easily being ridden out. CABBAGE rated early traveling in the second flight, came four wide upper stretch, closed
 willingly taking second place. TZI OUR DESTINY pressed from the start, edged clear mid turn, headed by the winner turning for home, proved no match
 tiring late just holding third place. DON'T HOLD ME NOW tracked racing in the four path, asked into the lane, mildly bid running between rivals then finished
 evenly beating others. DANCING QUEENIE settled towards the rear, mildly bid in the lane but was no real threat. DIVINE CONFECTION well placed laying
 up close along the rail, began to chase from mid turn, lacked response tiring in the drive. SALLY OH SALLY broke well and angled to the rail, pressured
 down the backside, battled to the quarter pole, gave way in upper stretch. POOF ITS MAGIC lacked speed, trailed throughout, never factored.

 along the inside. TIZ ALL BIZ pressured the pace dueling into upper stretch battling from the rail ceding to wide pressure late. WICKED FUN went evenly
 early fading on the far turn, came five wide in upper stretch angling to the six path while giving a late move. MOON IN MY SHINE away alertly set a
 pressured pace dueling to upper stretch weakening in the four path late.

 Footnotes
 MAJESTIC DESERT pressed down the backside, took over at the half, repulsed SPLENDIFEROUS in upper stretch holding sway to the wire. AFORTABLE
 well placed racing in the three path, gave chase into the stretch, was held safe by the winner holding second place. VACATION TIME led into the first turn,
 passed by the winner going into the far turn, dropped off to trail at the quarter pole, came again racing along the rail from mid stretch rallying up securing the
 show position. SPLENDIFEROUS stalked to the far turn, almost drew even with the winner at the quarter pole, was repulsed by mid stretch, tired missing a
 minor award. MAJESTIC SPRING rated early and trailed at the half, roused coming to the six path in upper stretch, lacked needed punch. PAR was not far
 off the leader going into the far turn, gave chase angling out four wide top of the stretch, lacked bid failing to threaten.

 BEST COUNTRY unhurried early rallied on the far turn angling out while dueling abreast rival late edging up gamely. ROMEO ROYALE sent clear set the
 pace saving ground to upper stretch, hooked late would duel inside of rival ceding grudgingly in the last yards. MISTERBULLTOYOU slow early circled out
 to upper stretch racing widest moving past the others in the six path. LIGHTHOUSE SOUND stalked the pace giving chase on the far turn, would weaken in
 the three path upper stretch. CHRISHI was crowded checking near the seven eighths pole, tracked the pace going evenly through the far turn, wore down
 on the inside the final eighth. RIVAS RUN slow early gave a mild rally on the far turn then weakened in upper stretch. GLENSTAL ABBEY failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 TROUBLED CHARLIE battled for the lead along the inside to the quarter pole, edged clear top of the stretch, held firm under strong handling in a very good
 effort. HARLAN'S HOWLING rated early racing along the inside, angled a bit mid stretch, split foes late rallying up securing second place in a willing
 manner. FIRE CONTROL settled in the second flight, bid between rivals mid stretch, was out finished late losing second place. NIEMI SAYS NO trailed
 down the backside, swung out six wide in upper stretch, improved position but was no real menace. I STAND ALONE unhurried traveling in the second
 flight, bid five wide running between foes in upper stretch, needed more late to make a real impact. LOVE RULES ALL well placed stalking along the rail,
 lacked rally and tired in mid stretch. LEMON ROYAL tracked around the turn from the three path, moved out a bit wider in mid stretch, tired inside the eighth
 pole. CONGRATS TO M K was hard used vying for the early lead, began to fade in upper stretch, gave way late finishing spent.

 Footnotes
 PURE TRUST rushed along the inside at the half to challenge for the lead, edged clear at the quarter pole, moved off the rail entering the stretch and
 widened from mid stretch being kept to task. PAY BACK hustled into the first turn taking the lead, traveled in the three path to the half, headed losing the
 lead on the far turn, dueled to the quarter pole, proved no match to the winner but gamely dug in saving second place. KODIAK MOON advanced at the
 half, loomed off the leader at the quarter pole, flattened out mid stretch and lost the battle for place in last jumps. INDY ARTIST forwardly placed along the
 rail, rallied to a menacing position at the quarter pole, failed to sustain move and flattened out mid stretch. SWEET BEER pressed early, gave chase leaving
 the far turn, lacked surge and weakened in the drive. EYE TO THRILL trailed throughout, asked mid turn, failed to respond, no threat.
