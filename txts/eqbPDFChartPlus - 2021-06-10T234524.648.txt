 Footnotes
 I O INES rated a clear pace inside, lost her clear margin through the backstretch and was met at near even terms leaving the five-sixteenths pole, dueled
 through the turn on the rail, then drove down the lane under moderate handling and held on. CAMILLE'S COMET settled off the pace on the outside, made
 a bid approaching the three-eighths pole and drew to near even terms past the five-sixteenths, dueled through the turn in the three path, then dug in gamely
 in the stretch but was unable to gain on the winner. BORN TO BE MILD broke in and bumped Greely's Striker at the start then settled off the pace on the
 inside, made a bid leaving the seven-sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the five path, then leveled off in the lane. IDENTITY THEFT settled off the
 pace on the inside and made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail, then weakened in the stretch. BECKY KECKI settled off the
 pace on the outside, made a bid nearing the quarter pole in the four path, then leveled off. GREELY'S STRIKER was bumped at the start by Born to Be Mild
 then was roughed while attempting to bear out in the first turn, showed little during the race, then drifted out in the final sixteenth. BOMBITA was never a
 factor. SASSAFRAS SPRINGS charged the gate before opening and was unprepared when the gate finally opened; was never a factor. RUNAWAY
 CHARITY came away rank and in at the start and was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 CAROLINA GOLD gave chase toward mid track down the backstretch, improved her position about the four path of the turn and dug in at the head of the
 lane to take over the final yards. GIANNA BELLA pressured the pace toward the inside, put a head in front midway on the turn, responded to steady urging
 at the head of the lane but was caught in the final yards. After lunging then bobbling at the break, FLASHY BARGIRL picked up the chase while racing off
 the rail, eased outward on the turn, entered the stretch about the eight path and finished evenly for third. AUNT LOIS chased the pace from the outside
 down the backstretch, angled in from the mid point of the turn, left the turn three wide then flattened out in the stretch. SCOFF chased the early pace toward
 the outside, angled in through the turn, entered the stretch about the three path and finished evenly. GREELEY'S BUSTNOUT engaged in close early chase
 toward the outside, rounded the turn in the six path, dropped back into the lane and weakened in the drive. SCARLET EMERALD set a pressured pace in
 the three path, was headed midway on the turn and weakened in the stretch.

 inside the sixteenth pole. ADA COWGIRL raced in the six path the first turn and settled outside leaving the seven eighths pole, moved toward the inside
 rounding the second turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and finished evenly. SIENNA'S ESTATE raced
 off the pace in the two and three paths, eased out with a bid into the backstretch, raced two deep through the far turn then leveled out down the lane.
 LITTLE TRICKY raced in the five path the first turn, moved toward the inside entering the stretch for the first time then proved no factor. After steadying
 early, INDIAN SPRINKLES raced well off the pace, eased out through the second turn then showed little response down the backstretch. LOVE TOTEM

 Footnotes
 After being carried slightly out entering the first turn, PRETTY GANGSTA came through the turn about the five path, started a bid leaving the three eighths
 pole, dug in at the head of the lane and closed with a rush to get up at the wire. REFORMED CAT hustled along early to take control of the pace and rated
 the lead from the three quarter pole, was pressured at the five sixteenths to widen the advantage through the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling
 but was caught at the wire. JAZZIE JO raced six wide the opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths
 pole then leveled off after acquiring third. HUNT'S RESERVE chased the pace inside through the front stretch and settled close into the first turn, bid
 nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then leveled off down the lane. SMARTY PLEASE raced off the pace in the five path the first
 turn and settled outside into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and finished evenly.
 TWILIGHTATWINDSOR came away slowly then saved ground well back, steadied at the rail in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, bid into the far turn,
 improved her position about the three path through the turn and finished evenly. BRING ON THE GREY rounded the first turn about the four path and
 showed little response through the backstretch. CHARITABLE GIRL saved ground off the pace, showed little response from the three eighths pole and
 faded toward the far turn. RAPID RABBIT was not a factor. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW rated close through the front stretch then drifted slightly into the first
 turn, stalked the pace through the turn, showed no response leaving the three eighths pole and faded.
