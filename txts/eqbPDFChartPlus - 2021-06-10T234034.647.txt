 Footnotes
 UTANDREAM advanced inside entering the far turn, eased out slightly and moved to the four path entering the lane, joined the leaders leaving the furlong
 grounds and finished steadily to prevail. BILLY RUN broke a bit slowly, moved up four wide into the far turn, bid three wide, raced between rivals a sixteenth
 out and finished gamely inside the top one. TROPICAL SURGE pulled early, battled for the lead and yielded late in a good effort. BLANK IT up close three
 wide, bid for the lead nearing the top of the lane and vied for command then needed more. ERGO pulled into the backstretch along the inside, moved out on
 the far turn, bore out turning for home going wide and weakened. EXPECT THE MAN between rivals early, lacked the needed response. GRAY A. Z. in
 close at the start, lacked a bid. BOB T vied early, saved ground and weakened rounding the far turn.

 pace inside, bid along the rail on the turn, altered course in the upper stretch, surged, was gaining fast and got up for place. CREATIVE ART pressed the
 pace while racing outside, challenged four across on the turn, dueled through the stretch, was outfinished and caught at the wire for second. MY SAMURAI
 WARRIOR pressed the pace, challenged three wide between horses on the turn and gave way. BEAR'S REALITY pressed the pace between horses,
 challenged for the lead on the turn and stopped.

 Footnotes
 SONYAS GOT A GUN prompted early inside, bid for the lead on the turn and raced off the rail into the stretch then finished steadily and edged clear. OUR
 LAST STAR reluctant at the gate then loaded without the rider, broke a bit awkwardly and was in tight at the start, advanced just off the inside turning for
 home and finished gamely. ITSONLYME set the pace and raced just off the inside on the turn, was carried out some into the stretch to be in the four path
 then yielded in the drive. AWESOME ROMANCE chased three wide on the turn, raced in the five path into the lane and tired. MY LAST PENNY bumped at
 the start, bid along the rail in the stretch then could sustain the needed momentum. STORMING REESE raced six wide turning for home and had no rally.
 BIG EIGHT came out some at the start then showed little.

 BONITA BOSS dueled to the sixteenth pole and drew off under urging. AWESOME PROPHECY dueled to the sixteenth pole, yielded, was no match late
 and finished second best. WAY OUT bumped at the start, dueled to the turn, fell back, angled out, bid six wide, couldn't gain and was all out for show.
 BLOWING STRONG pressed the pace along the rail, fell back and lacked the needed late rally. BE SO LUCKY broke awkwardly to be away slowly, raced in
 the back, went seven wide entering the stretch and improved position. UNION FLYER bobbled a bit at the start, pressed the pace between horses to turn
 and gave way. JUST HITCHED put in an even effort and was not a factor. HEART OF DAVID broke in and bumped at the start, trailed the field and passed
 a tiring rival. ROYAL TITAN raced outside, showed brief speed and stopped.

 CONSUMERCONFIDENCE well placed early, pulled some, bid from the three path turning for home, bumped with a rival entering the stretch and battled
 through the lane then prevailed at the wire. PATIENCE OFA SAINT up close saving ground, awaited room briefly turning for home, eased off the inside and
 bid between rivals, battled for command inside the top one and was narrowly beaten. EKATI WILDCAT raced just off the inside into the far turn, was five
 wide into the lane and finished willingly. COOL HAND LUCAS saved ground, moved to the four path for the drive and gradually gained while needing more
 late. AWHITESPORTSCOAT set the pace inside, responded willingly in upper stretch then yielded in the drive. TEAM FIREBALL lunged out at the break,
 trailed, was along the inside through the stretch run and lacked a late response. SMARTY PARTY PAPA three wide into the far turn, raced in the four path
 entering the lane and lacked a bid. BET THE HARBOR moved up early from the outside, prompted the issue, bumped with a rival turning for home and
 tired.

 Footnotes
 MY HEART IS YOURS stalked the pace outside, challenged three across on the turn, dueled to deep stretch, inched away and was all out at the wire.
 BEA'S BENCH was unhurried early, dropped inside to save ground, bid along the rail leaving the turn, closed willingly, angled out late and was gaining
 ground. STAR OF THE DAY raced mid pack, bid off the rail, shifted out for the drive, closed willingly and gained late. AYE AYE OH pressed the pace inside,
 challenged along the rail on the turn, dueled to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. R SILVER CHARM was sent to the front, set the pace to the turn, was
 taken back from between horses in the upper stretch, shifted out and went willingly to the wire. SAMANTHA MI REYNA raced in the back, went six wide at
 the top of the stretch and lacked the needed late rally. SECRET AGENT GIRL raced mid pack, went five wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a late
 response. BEAR'S AND BELLE'S broke slowly, was hustled along to stalk the pace and gave way into the turn. PLUNGE was void of early speed, went
 seven wide entering the stretch and was not urged late.

 XTREME LYRA vied through the opening stages then prompted the issue, dueled through the lane and edged clear late. LODE THE GOLD set the pace,
 raced off the rail into the lane and battled through the stretch then could no match the top one late in a good effort. SUPER SWISS up close three wide,
 raced in the five path entering the stretch and lacked the needed late response. HUNDRED YEARS broke out, raced outside into the turn, was in the five
 path entering the lane and offered a mild gain. RUNN'N REBEL broke in, was steadied nearing the half mile pole when running up behind rivals, raced close
 up and tired in the drive. MY MAJESTY bumped at the start, raced up close early, saved ground and tired in the drive. MT. LEINSTER had no rally.
 JOHNNIE B bumped at the start, raced inside on the turn and weakened.

 Footnotes
 TRICK CITY set the pace, drew off on the second turn and held safely while kept to task. IRISH LASS raced mid pack, angled out on the turn, bid six wide
 and closed to earn place while no match for the winner. BIG ALICE lagged early, went seven wide leaving the turn and finished well to get up for show. FOG
 HAPPENS was rated back at the start, unhurried early and saved ground, angled out in the upper stretch and offered a mild bid only. ENGLISH LACE
 stalked the pace while racing inside, was steadied slightly along the backstretch, fell back on the turn and weakened. ELECTRO PEG was never far back,
 lacked a stretch response and did not threaten. BEAR FACTS was void of early speed, bid inside leaving the turn and improved position. PERFECT
 PARADISE pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and faded through the stretch. ENTITLED STAR raced close to the pace, went five wide at the top of
 the stretch and gave way. KODIAK KWIK was not a factor. CELESTIALCHRISTINA raced in the back, went eight wide leaving the turn, lacked a bid and
 showed little. JUST GOT LUCKY was eased and walked off.
