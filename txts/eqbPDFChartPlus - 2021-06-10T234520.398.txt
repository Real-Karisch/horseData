 DAGGER raced in midpack, chased five-wide on the turn and was all out through the stretch. TWO TRIBES, in midpack early, was hustled angling from two
 to five-wide on the turn then finished determinedly between foes. NOW PLAY NICE settled off the pace, was checked in traffic early turn, chased three to
 six-wide then rallied widest. PIPER'S LEGACY, off slowly then pinched back early, settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide through the turn,

 bid upper stretch, was passed midstretch and was through. IRISH TEARDROP (GB) raced in midpack, was hustled four-wide on the turn then lacked a

 settled in midpack, came along the rail and two-wide through the turn, encountered traffic in the stretch and lacked a rally. ALNILAH stalked the pace,
