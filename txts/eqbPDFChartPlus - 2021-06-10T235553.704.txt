 Footnotes
 BURNTWOOD set the pace two wide and then edged away through the final sixteenth. RECANTED stalked the pace inside winner, moved off the rail in
 deep stretch and was unable to match strides late. EMOTICON, racing just off the rail, eased out through the stretch and came back for show.
 SHOTMASTER saved ground while outrun early, was being eased up in the final strides and was nipped for third. FLYING ROCKET raced very wide and
 was never a serious threat. ZIPPED CODE, racing inside his stablemate early, drifted out through the final quarter mile and tired. HOWBOUTDEMPATS,
 wide, failed to be a serious factor. SIR SIDNEY was very wide and just off the early pace, tired badly. HIGH DOLLAR KITTEN also raced very wide and
 tired.

 Footnotes
 PELLAGRINO lagged far behind, moved boldly outside, advancd very wide on the turn then surged away through the final furlong. TRICKY GAMBLE
 pursued the loose pacesetter, moved with the winner into the stretch but was no match for the winner. KOMRAD quickly sprinted clear, was collared into the
 stretch and weakened. CORNET bore out and raced greenly in the opening quarter then continued well wide. BUILT BETTER saved ground close up to the
 turn and gave way. KAIROS urged just off the leaders wide to the far turn and stopped.

 Footnotes
 UNDENIABLE TEMPER was outrun while in the three path, moved out wide on the final turn and closed strongly to win going away. COUNTY
 CORRECTIONS, just off rail and never far back, drifted out through deep stretch and was along for place. AMERICAN ROMA, in the three path, was left
 with the lead on far turn, drifted out through stretch and after opening a clear advantage, faded late. TRUE BLUE, between foes and just off the pace, tired.
 RAPO set the early pace four path, took a bad step and lost action near the three eighths pole, fell back through the lane. SECRET SECRET was in motion
 in the gate, lunged after breaking slowly and was never a factor. KLAATU bore out on the final turn and gave way. DIAMOND SQUARE came out leaving
 the gate, prompted outside and then stopped.

 SILVER EXCESS, between rivals early, swung wide into stretch, drifted wider rallying through stretch and while finishing near the middle of the track, she
 drew away. CRAZY DAISY saved ground just off pace, moved out near stretch, drifted wider, took the lead briefly deep stretch but then was no match.
 ATINA SALSA took the lead three wide, remained outside setting the pace and then faded through the drive. FRIDAY MASS, between rivals early, fell back
 after a quarter mile and didn't threaten. DESERTED saved ground and failed to threaten. TRUE YANKEE, three wide and just off the pace, tired. CHEVY
 TO THE LEVY broke slowly, raced very wide and eventually lost contact with the field. .
