 Footnotes
 UNION OBSESSION was in the four path through the turns when never far back, was asked for more approaching the quarter pole, swung four wide and in
 the five path into the lane, was under strong handling through the lane and edged to the front and held. RIDDLEMEREE was in the two path through the
 turn when behind wall of rivals, continued behind many into the lane, looked inside and out without avail to find a path, altered sharply outward approaching
 the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy. NICOLES CLASSYGIRL was in the three path while close up, bid three wide into the far turn gained a
 short lead through late turn and into the lane while under extreme pressure, continued with the narrow advantage after straightening then could not hold the
 winner safe and lost the place spot late. BANG set the pace while along the inside of others, continued to led in mid-turn when challenged, relinquished the
 advantage into the lane and weakened. ZEMO pressed the vied two wide into the far turn then faltered after turning into the lane. SURE SHE'S GRAND was
 along the inside throughout, came into the lane from the rail with an open rail then lacked a closing response. BABAKNOWSEVRYTHING was never a
 factor while in the three or four path through the turns. HOPE TO SHINE was in the five to the four path through the first turn, continued into the far turn from
 the two or three path and was never in it.

 STEVES EVEN chased the pace from the four to the three path, bid three wide near the quarter pole, swung into the lane from the four path while gaining
 the lead, widened and continued on with good energy to be well clear at the wire. PLEASANT SUNRISE stalked the three rival duel through the turn while in
 the four path, came into the lane with aim on the winner from the five path and could not gain on that one while clearly second best.
 HOOSIERENTEPRENEUR vied from between rivals through the turn while between rivals, continued with a short lead into the lane then gave way to the
 top two and kept on to save the show spot. RATTLE MY CHAIN was in the three to the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and
 moved up while not a threat. STAR DE WARRIOR vied for the lead along the inside through late turn then gave way entering the lane. STONEFIELD
 FOREST chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane as a contender then tired late. ROMALOMADINGDONG was never a
 factor while along the inside. CRAFTY CHARGER raced in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and never factored.
 ROAD WEST was off with a slight hop at the start, raced along the inside and was never in it. HANDFUL OF CRYSTAL raced near the rail and was never in
 it. HOME FOREVER was in the two or three path through the turn and was always well back. BOLD ENCHANTMENT was done early while in the two path
 through the turn.

 Footnotes
 ASONGFORYOU vied for the lead along the inside, shook clear of dueling challenger after straightening in the lane, shortened inside the sixteenth pole and
 was under a drive to last. ZEROED IN vied for the lead two wide through the turn, lost contact with the winner into the lane, kept on and was coming again
 as winner struggled a bit late. SIX SHOOTER chased the dueling leaders through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane from the four path and
 finished evenly. ROUGHIN THE CITY was bumped at the start, raced in the three or four path through the turn, was in the five path in the lane and found
 energy late to be gaining to the wire. DIAL A RIDE was never a threat while in the two or three path through the turn. KNOCKS BIG THIRST vied for the
 lead three wide early, settled off the dueling leaders into the turn, was getting out entering the turn, rider worked to maintain a consistent path through the
 turn, dropped to the rail for the drive and tired. LOUIS GEORGE was never a menace while in the two path. COOL SAILOR hesitated then hopped to the
 outside at the start, bumping rival, raced far back thereafter. MOLOKAI NIGHT broke inwardly and brushed the gate, raced far back while in the three path.
 EDDIE AT BAT was slow to get going spotting the field a few lengths and always trailed.

 Footnotes
 MIA TIVA TOO was in the three or four path through the turn when never far back, moved up three wide approaching the quarter pole under minimal
 encouragement, asked for more leaving the turn then swept past and slowly widened through the lane. SIDNEY'S RANSOM raced near the rail through the
 turn an into the lane, bid when straightening into the lane to get nearest the winner then could not gain further and settled for second best. PEEKACHO in
 the three to the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path then moved up for the show spot. ARTIE'S KIDDING was along the inside
 through the turn and into the lane and moved up while not a threat. BROUILLARD was in the three path through the turn when well back, continued in the
 four path entering the lane and improved position while widest. ON JOHN never made a serious impact while saving ground. UNO MAS BRANDY pressed
 the pace two wide into mid-turn, gained the lead in late turn then gave way entering the lane. CONFEDERATE RAGS was in the five path throughout and
 never factored. OUR SEA HERO set the pace along the inside into turn, dueled for the lead into late turn then faded entering the lane. ILLUSION'S RULE
 was close up early while in the four path then steadily faded after mid-turn. LAST CHARGER was done early while in the two to the four path through the
 turn.

 REY no threat. FIRST PRIZE PEPSI mid-pack, no factor. HEZA SHOT OF JZ crowded, jostled early. SHEZA CLASSY SENATOR angled out start, no
 menace. BUSTER MACHINE no impact. YOGI B bumped, forced out early. HOPEFUL SUCCESS lost path early, trailed.
