 Footnotes
 SASSAFRAS SPRINGS rushed up and angled in to rate the pace inside, increased her lead in the backstretch and around the far turn on the rail, then
 drove down the lane and held on well. MY AWSOME ALIE settled well off the pace on the outside and made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole, steadily
 improved through the turn in the six path, then raced down the lane, passing rivals and gaining on the winner, and just lasted for second. RUNAWAY
 CHARITY saved ground in the first turn and settled off the pace on the inside, moved to the outside entering the backstretch and improved without
 encouragement past the three-eighths pole, made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths and rounded the far turn in the three path, then dug in down the stretch
 and just missed second. ME TOO was unprepared at the start then angled in to the rail through the front stretch and saved ground in the first turn, settled
 well off the pace on the inside, made a bid near the three-eighths pole and rounded the turn in the three path, then moved to the outside leaving the turn,
 lugged in through the upper stretch, and finished well. ALREADY BETTYE settled off the pace on the inside, made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole and
 took the far turn on the rail, but leveled off in the stretch. WORK WIFE raced in the middle of the pack throughout and flattened in the lane. SALLY
 POLLOCK HIGH was never a factor. MS. SHOSHO stalked the pace on the outside and was through after a half.

 Footnotes
 After stumbling from the gate, BOUND TO WINDSOR settled off the pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, angled five wide nearing
 the turn, raced six wide through the turn, took the lead past the eighth pole, dueled clear midstretch and widened the final sixteenth. LET ME BE chased the
 pace toward mid track, raced in the four path rounding the turn, took the lead three wide nearing the head of the lane, drifted a bit leaving the turn and lost
 the lead just inside the eighth pole but dug in through the lane to hold well in place. Jostled then pinched back at the start, FLIRTIN HEART picked up the
 chase toward mid track, raced five wide on the turn, left the turn six wide then dueled the length of the stretch for third. GHOST FEVER broke out to make
 contact with Flirtin Heart, gave chase toward the inside, steadied at the heels of Silken Belle nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced boxed in through the
 turn then outfinished in the duel for third. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG chased the pace toward the inside, steadied at the inside flank of Flirtin Heart leaving
 the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail, angled out through the upper stretch and finished evenly. LIVE FREE engaged in close early chase in
 the three and four paths, kept aim through the turn but dropped back at the rail inside the eighth pole and weakened in the stretch. FALSE PROPHET broke
 out and exchanged contact with Bound To Windsor, gave chase toward the inside, angled out through the turn, entered the stretch widest and showed little
 further. LADY'S LADY raced well back. SILKEN BELLE set a pressured pace toward the inside, raced at the rail rounding the turn then weakened in the
 stretch. MISTRO ALI broke in making contact with Flirtin Heart, gave chase toward the outside then weakened rounding the turn.

 ISCHIA was checked off the inside flank of I'm a Hot Babe going into the first turn then settled off the pace inside, moved to the outside entering the
 backstretch, made a bid at the three-eighths pole and steadily improved through the turn in the five path, then drove down the lane, gaining and passing
 rivals, to come up in the final strides. FRANCESCA DI FIORI was bumped at the start by Bayou Bijou then settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid
 leaving the three-eighths pole, took the far turn in the five path, then gained down the stretch and came up first in later yards but was quickly passed and
 had to settle for second. LOVE IS LOVE stalked the pace on the inside, eased out into the backstretch, made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole, drew to even
 terms near the quarter pole and dueled from there through the turn in the three path and down the stretch, but leveled off in later yards. RUMERS ARE
 TRUE hustled up while angling in to rate the pace inside, took all turns on the rail, was met at even terms approaching the quarter pole and dueled from
 there through the turn and down the stretch but was caught in later yards and weakened. ROCKET THUNDER settled off the pace at a distant third on the
 outside and angled in to the rail entering the backstretch, made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn on the rail, but showed little
 further. BAYOU BIJOU broke out and bumped Francesca Di Fiori at the start then raced well back and was never a threat. I'M A HOT BABE saved ground
 in the first turn and was through early.

 ROLLING BROOK took over leaving the half mile pole and rated the pace, was hand urged past the quarter pole, driven into the lane, dug in gamely to the
 challenge of Windsor Calling past the eighth pole and edged that one out through the final sixteenth. WINDSOR CALLING stalked the pace through the
 backstretch, gave chase past the five sixteenths pole, challenged the winner leaving the turn, drew alongside that one later yards but raced erratically and
 drifted outward nearing the wire. ARYA PEACEFUL raced well back toward the inside, bid at the rail leaving the quarter pole, drifted into the lane and
 finished evenly for show. HANDSOME HUNT gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened stride through
 the lane. HANOVER CHROME chased the pace from the outside, raced in the five path rounding the turn then leveled out in the drive. CROSSING THE
 BLUES gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail then weakened in the stretch. After hesitating at the break, ECLIPSE ROYALE raced well
 back.

 made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole, steadily improved through the turn in the five path, then dug in down the stretch and came up in later yards, but
 was passed just before the wire. SAILAWAY was bumped out going into the first turn then settled off the pace three wide, made a bid approaching the
 five-sixteenths pole, took the lead near the quarter pole in the three path, then angled in to the rail mid-turn and dug in gamely in the lane but was caught in
 later yards and leveled off toward the wire. COOL RULER settled well off the pace on the outside, dropped to the back through the backstretch, made a bid
 past the quarter pole and rallied through the turn in the five path, then lugged in mid-stretch and leveled off. WHISPERING BILL was roughed off the heels
 of One Move and bumped going into the first turn, then settled off the pace inside, eased out moving into the backstretch, dropped to the back through the
 turn in the four path, then weakened. GAME MAKER was bumped out into the first turn and raced wide; was through early. PRICELESS DANCER battled to
 the front and angled in to rate the pace inside, rounded all turns on the rail, then was caught nearing the quarter pole and faded. ONE MOVE was checked
 sharply and angled out from the heels of Priceless Dancer moving into the first turn and bumped Game Maker, then settled off the pace on the outside,

 Footnotes
 DANCING ROY stalked the pace while racing off the rail, moved to even terms approaching the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead toward the quarter,
 dueled clear midway on the far turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. GUTS AND GLORY drifted into the first turn then gave chase
 entering the backstretch, improved four wide on the far turn and dueled for second the final sixteenth. CITI'S BAROMETER rated the pace inside, was met
 at even terms nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back toward the quarter then outfinished in the duel for second. FIGPENN rated just off the pace
 and off the rail, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail rounding the far turn then weakened in the stretch. MARCO'S LION, just off
 the pace toward the inside the opening turn, dropped back into the backstretch, eased outward on the far turn, entered the stretch about the six path and
 showed little further. VASTEN saved ground off the pace, bid mildly past the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail rounding the far turn. STAR SENSE
 closed to contention through the front stretch and stalked the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, showed little response down the backstretch and
 faded into the far turn. WINRWINRCHIXNDINNR was carried out into the first turn, raced wide through the turn and never factored. KLONDIKE KOP
 bobbled leaving the gate and was through early. RUB THE ROCK stumbled badly leaving the gate and raced wide into the first turn.
