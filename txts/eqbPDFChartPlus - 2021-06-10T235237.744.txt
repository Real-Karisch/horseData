 Footnotes
 DADDY WAS A HUSSLA rated on the front end outside WILL WANTS CANDY, moved clear when allowed on the turn, was roused leaving the bend then
 steadily opened up in the lane while kept to a drive to the waning yards. AHNIWAKE made a small lunge after serious hesitation leaving the gate,
 progressed from inside rivals on the backstretch, angled out to path three on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run, took over second nearing the
 last furlong then could only pull away for the place late. WILL WANTS CANDY displayed early speed from inside, did not stay with DADDY WAS A HUSSLA
 on the bend, swung outside the latter entering the stretch and gradually wore down. LADY JOY chased from off the rail, angled in on the turn, floated out
 some entering the lane, lodged a mild bid inside WILL WANTS CANDY and narrowly missed for third. GOTTA GO BACK soon trailed and moved to the
 inside, came off the rail some on the bend, moved back to the rail for a clear path at the top of the lane and passed some tired ones. JUST CHARLIE was a
 factor from outside but began to yield widest on the turn. NEVAEHA'S RAIN in contention between horses on the backstretch, began to tire three wide on
 the bend.

 Footnotes
 GREEN MEANS GO soon took the early lead, gradually angled in while in hand on the backstretch, moved clear when let out some on the bend, was
 roused in the lane, opened up on the rest under a mild drive and was drifting out inside the final sixteenth. BAD MOON was away slowly and allowed to
 settle, picked up his pace along the rail after a quarter mile, angled two wide for a clear path into the stretch, steadily advanced under a drive and gained
 second nearing the wire. SHMILY altered his path several times looking for room behind traffic on the backstretch, was boxed in on the bend, got through
 three wide nearing the quarter pole, fanned out further for the stretch run, battled for second but was outfinished in a game effort. JAGUAR RIDGE
 prominent between horses, advanced to second two wide on the turn, fanned outside GREEN MEANS GO for the drive, fought to keep second through the
 lane but did not have enough left through the waning yards. MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET pressed from inside, was checked as his path narrowed into the turn,
 continued along the rail and gradually yielded. DR. LIECHTY steadily shortened his stride after a quarter mile while running widest.

 Footnotes
 CONTROVERSY shared the early lead from outside while in hand, took the advantage with a quarter mile to go, was let out into the lane, put to a drive with
 a furlong left and drew away. ARKANSAS TRAVELER prominent from the beginning, was just off the rail on the turn, gained second from between horses
 inside the last eighth, was all out but could only just hold her position. STREET SMARTY gradually angled to the inside on the backstretch, swung out
 leaving the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied belatedly but caught SHE'S BACK AGAIN for third. SHE'S BACK AGAIN contested the pace
 between horses early, did not keep up on the bend, swung out to path four into the stretch and ran evenly to the wire. JOSIE JEWELL, whose rider did not
 carry a whip, displayed early speed from inside but began to flatten under hand urging the last quarter mile. CAUSING SMILES failed to menace running
 widest. ORIENT'S JOY was void of speed, though hustled along, stayed just off the inside taking the bend and had no late bid.

 Footnotes
 MY FOUROONE KPLAN was under a drive just after the break, gained the lead before finishing the first furlong, stayed just off the inside, was urged
 through the bend, under a drive in the lane and held ELIZABETH'S FEVER at bay. ELIZABETH'S FEVER broke alertly, was overtaken nearing the end of
 the first eighth, was kept close just outside MY FOUROONE KPLAN, steadily made up ground on the weakening leader the last furlong but was too late.
 LIFE IS A RIDE in contention early from outside, was widest taking the bend, came five wide into the lane, closed well, came up short but gained third in
 time. CATHERINE EUGENIA was a factor just off the rail on the backstretch, advanced along the rail on the bend, came off the rail some in the lane,
 loomed a threat inside the last eighth but was boxed in through the waning yards. HEIDI WHO settled inside, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, saved
 ground taking the turn, gained a clear path along the rail midstretch, made a strong move but also was too late. TRYST CAT forwardly placed between
 horses, went for the lead from path four on the turn but gradually yielded through the lane. SASSY AND REGAL was a factor from outside on the
 backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, angled in leaving the turn to be just off the inside and steadily faded.

 Footnotes
 GREAT SCAT hesitated at the break, advanced from inside, angled out three wide midway on the backstretch, went for the lead outside MUTAKDDIM
 ROAD on the bend, had the advantage into the lane, was put to a drive, steadily drew off and was kept to urging until the last seventy yards. MUTAKDDIM
 ROAD shared the early lead outside EL CAMINANTE, moved clear after a quarter mile, stayed just off the inside taking the turn, lost the lead into the lane,
 moved to the rail upper stretch, was no match for GREAT SCAT but was unchallenged for second. LT DAN ATTACK chased from between horses, was
 jostled by ROBBIE JONES midway on the backstretch, just off the rail on the turn, fanned outside GREAT SCAT into the lane, moved clear for third, began
 to wear down the last eighth but held the show. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) void of speed from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, angled outside LT DAN
 ATTACK at the top of the stretch and was closing in on that one late. ROBBIE JONES altered out midway on the backstretch when GREAT SCAT came
 close, jostled briefly with LT DAN ATTACK, moved to the rail soon after, altered out upper stretch then gradually lugged in. CHRISTMAS COOKIE was
 reluctant to load, soon trailed when the race began, was just off the inside on the turn, swung out into the lane and changed his course twice, each time
 ROBBIE JONES took his path. EL CAMINANTE displayed early speed from inside but began to yield after a quarter mile.

 Footnotes
 WELL MAID hesitated at the break, advanced between rivals, under a drive three wide on the bend, took over upper stretch, was kept to urging and
 maintained full control. AIR ELLIE bumped just after the start, chased from between foes, did not keep up two wide on the turn, lost ground fanning to path
 six into the stretch, closed well and gained second sixty yards out. STAR MAGNA altered in when crowded at the start, bumped AIR ELLIE, was steadied,
 chased from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, drifted out to path five into the stretch and could not sustain her bid the final furlong. COUNTRY
 ASSETS vied for the early lead off the rail but inside JUST ADDY, took the rail on the turn, moved ahead, could not stay with WELL MAID upper stretch and
 weakened the last eighth. JUST ADDY broke inward, disputed the pace from outside but began to wear down two wide before finishing a half mile.
 WADDLE soon trailed just off the inside, began to swing out leaving the bend, her rider lost his whip with a quarter mile left, lost considerable ground
 fanning to the middle of the track for the stretch run but was closing the gap under hand urging the last furlong. TUMULTUOUS GAL was a contender from
 inside for a half mile but tired for the drive.

 Footnotes
 DOROTHE MARIE shared the early lead from outside, moved in beside ISABELLACANNETELLA into the bend, was put to a drive approaching the last
 quarter mile, floated out into the lane, drew clear, gradually drifted out despite steady right-handed urging the last furlong but held sway. SHE'S VENTASTIC
 raced in the second flight from just off or along the rail, angled out on the bend, advanced, came into the lane five wide, fought for second inside the last
 furlong, gradually closed the gap on the leader and angled inside DOROTHE MARIE near the wire. ROYAL CITY reluctant to load, raced in contention
 toward the outside on the backstretch, improved position four wide on the turn, fanned out further for a clear path into the lane, rallied outside SHE'S
 VENTASTIC the final eighth as she battled for second but lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. MAY BE SUSPECT advanced from inside on the
 turn, swung outside DOROTHE MARIE entering the stretch and began to wear down in the late going. SEATTLE TRAIN soon trailed, stayed just off the
 inside on the turn, fanned to path three for the drive and passed between tired rivals. ICE ATTACK a step slow at the start, was an earl factor from outside
 but gradually faded running widest once on the turn. ISABELLACANNETELLA hustled from the gate, ducked into the gap, was corrected and urged up to
 dispute the pace from inside but tired through the stretch. AT THE WIRE displayed brief speed between horses but began to tire two wide after a quarter
 mile. The rider of SHE'S VENTASTIC lodged an objection alleging interference from DOROTHE MARIE deep stretch. After their review, the stewards did
 not uphold that objection.
