 Footnotes
 HYDRAULIC , urged soon after the break, swept to a three deep lead near the quarter pole, was kept to his business in the stretch and drew out the final
 furlong. CYCLOBOMB gained the lead outside JACK OF SPADES mid way on the turn, lost the advantage entering the stretch, prompted the winner to mid
 stretch then faded. JACK OF SPADES , reluctant to load into the starting gate, broke alertly, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and faded through
 the stretch. ARRIVE IN STYLE lacked speed, raced along the rail on the turn, swung to the three path leaving the turn and failed to be a factor. EAGLE
 CAVIAR chased the pace, was two wide leaving the turn and faltered. QUEST OF GLORY trailed.

 Footnotes
 LETMESLIDEBYYOU cleared early, dictated the pace inside, moved away approaching the stretch, responded when set down in upper stretch and held
 sway under a drive. MAJORIE MUGS , between rivals early, eased back a bit near the half and angled out, circled five wide advancing into the stretch,
 flattened out some late but saved the place. SATURDAY'S REIN saved ground stalking the pace, steadied when attempting to lug out past the three and a
 half furlong marker, shifted wide for the drive and had a mild response. ROCK ON SANDY stalked the pace two wide, failed to go on while under a ride
 nearing the lane and faded. LADYOFTHEHIERARCHY , rank soon after the break, advanced wide past the five eighths pole, chased three wide mid turn
 then tired through the final three sixteenths.

 MAGICAL prompted the pace three wide outside AMAPOLA, moved to apply more pressure after a half mile, ground that one down under hand
 encouragement and took over nearing the eighth pole, responded to left handed pressure soon after and steadily pulled away. AMAPOLA grabbed
 command soon after the break, set a rated pace off the inside, dug in when confronted near the quarter pole, dueled, ceded the lead near mid stretch and
 kept on willingly to be well clear of the rest. TOWSON chased the pace outside a rival nearing the lane and gained the show. GINGERESK prompted the
 early pace along the rail, failed to quicken with the leaders leaving the far turn and faded. WARRIOR OF LIGHT stumbled badly at the break, found herself
 well back after recovering and simply galloped around.

 NAKAMURA , two wide leaving the backstretch, bumped with UNO DANCER entering the far turn, closed outside horses late and was up in time. HELICAT
 saved ground, disputed the pace, gained a clear lead near the eighth pole, bobbled slightly late and just missed in a game effort. GOODLUCKJOHNATHAN
 , three wide the first turn, disputed the pace two wide around the far turn, lugged in under right hand whipping near the eighth pole and finished willingly.
 ROBIN HOOD , unhurried early, eased out leaving the backstretch and only offered a mild, late move. UNO DANCER , fractious in the starting gate, hugged
 the inner rail leaving the backstretch and was steadied when bumping with the winner entering the far turn. STUNNING BABY , three wide both turns, failed
 to rally. BEST WAY broke sluggishly and was no factor. KINGSTON PIKE gave way on the far turn. An objection by the rider of UNO DANCER against the
 winner for alleged interference entering the far turn was not allowed.

 CAITLYN'S WISH , taken to rate early while off the rail, commenced a run after being put to pressure three furlongs out, circled four wide progressing into
 the lane, sustained under a drive, took command near the sixteenth marker and prevailed. I JUST WANNA WIN saved ground chasing the pace, shifted out
 leaving the eighth pole, rallied gamely between rivals and just missed to the inside of the winner. LADY KESWICK pulled her way clear early on, set a solid
 pace in the two path, remained clear under a drive past mid stretch then weakened late. STELLA NOVA chased early and dropped back. STAFF SGT
 RECKLESS failed to keep pace. UNBRIDLED ESCAPE dropped back early. TANGO DELTA saved ground off the early pace, took a bad step leaving the
 far turn, was pulled up lame shortly thereafter and was vanned off.

 TRAFFICPLAN edged up inside in the opening sixteenth and engaged LITTLE LAUGHS, sparred with that one from there, gained a slim lead soon into the
 stretch and dug in tenaciously through an extended drive. LITTLE LAUGHS vied three wide outside the winner, held a short lead nearing the quarter pole,
 wandered outward a bit entering the lane, straightened and battled on gamely to the end. MY CHESA CHARM drafted back after an alert beginning and
 settled in the clear, angled out around the turn, circled four to five wide, was roused near the three sixteenths but failed to rally while under steady hand
 coaxing late. IT'S A DOOZY angled to the rail near the far turn, moved up a bit mid turn, eased out in the drive but came up empty. SHARON'S THUNDER
 broke a step slow, raced off the pace, was under a ride three wide mid turn, angled further out near mid stretch but lacked a bid. TOP STREET , away
 alertly, prompted the dueling leaders three wide, was under a drive to hold position mid turn, stayed on to upper stretch then faded. CHEROKEE FIRE , two
 wide rating behind the leaders near the half mile pole, was under strong urging mid turn, failed to kick on approaching the stretch and dropped back.

 Footnotes
 SHOOT THE GAP vied between rivals early, moved clear leaving the three eighths pole, dug in when confronted by ARMY GREY in upper stretch, dueled,
 briefly ceded command near mid stretch, battled back under strong handling to gain a slight advantage a sixteenth out, exchanged a brush and was all out
 to prevail. ARMY GREY settled outside, commenced a run leaving the three eighths pole, ranged up four wide into the lane, drew alongside the winner then
 briefly put a nose in front in mid stretch, dueled, switched to his left lead after brushing with SHOOT THE GAP near the sixteenth marker, continued gamely
 and lost the bob. CONQUISTODOR FUEGO , taken to rate off the rail, came under pressure after a half mile, circled four wide into the lane, slowly gained in
 the final sixteenth and just got the show. LOVELY GAMES was steadied along behind the leaders early on, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled five
 wide for the drive and rallied. SLIM stalked the pace, angled to the rail around the turn, slipped through inside and gained near mid stretch then flattened out
 late. ZEKE THE STREAK was hustled up inside rivals leaving the chute and prompted the early pace, eased back nearing the turn and stalked, shifted out
 and chased between rivals near mid stretch and faded. FEAR THE REAPER , in mid pack and off the rail, was under a ride three wide mid turn but failed to
 generate the needed kick. MUCH MALIGNED , three deep early forcing the pace, was under a hearty ride trying to keep up past the three eighths, stayed
 on to the quarter pole then gave way. TWO PUNCH SMART was steadied off heels leaving the chute and failed to menace. PERFECT ME , fractious in the
 gate, lacked speed and was outrun. SO HOT lost contact early and never recovered.
