 FUTURE STATE stalked and saved through the backstretch, gained a narrow advantage approaching the stretch, drifted in through the stretch run and held
 firm under encouragement. FIT FOR ROYALTY led the way through the backstretch, was overtaken entering the stretch, kept along with response and
 weakened. JANE'S REVENGE saved on rail, shifted out into the lane and lacked the bid that was needed late. RACING THE WIND sat in range, chased
 outside but failed to menace through the drive. BONNIE TRADER vied outside racing three wide through the backstretch and faded.

 Footnotes
 BIONIC BIRD sped to the front, held good margins racing through the turn and held under mild encouragement. CANAVERAL BAY broke alertly, raced in
 closest pursuit, gained closer order leaving the turn but could not get to BIONIC BIRD late stretch. IMPERIAL STORM checked at the five and half marker,
 lodged a three wide bid and closed well for show. COLE'S CORNER hustled between foes in the early stages, roused inside and evened out through the
 stretch. COTTAGE saved inside, raced in close quarters entering the turn and lacked bid. KIPPENDREW tracked outside and failed to threaten.

 THISDEWARSFORYOU sprinted clear at once, responded willingly to looming threat through the turn and stayed clear under light handling. PACIORETTY
 sent for speed inside, moved up closer to prompt action, loomed boldly then shifted out at the three sixteenth, was all out and was no match for the winner.
 RAINY BAY lacked early speed, tracked outside through the backstretch, needed more for impact and held for show. CLEAR THE RUNWAY rated off the
 pace from the three pace, lodged a bid but was unable to improve contending position. LITTLE SCOTTY raced three wide in striking distance and had
 nothing in reserved for the drive.

 HOLLER AT THE MOON quickly took command, remained unchallenged racing into the lane, kept to task under light handling and was geared down to an
 easy victory. PAKAL lacked early foot, rallied inside of TROJAN, drew away through the stretch and held safely for place. MADE FOR SATURDAY chased
 outside, launched a bid into the stretch and got by late for show. TROJAN rallied four wide into the lane and was edged out late. MARCHTOTHEMUSIC
 chased outside and failed to menace. CAPITALISM showed little.

 Footnotes
 BOXER BOY tracked the pacesetters, moved up to inside to challenge the leader, drew clear through the stretch under periodic reminders and was ridden
 out. TRILL POINT set the pace under a snug hold, was overtaken leaving the final turn and continued on with a steady effort finishing best of the rest.
 RAYREADY trailed the field, closed steadily getting by late for minor share. NEVERADOUBT lodged a bid in the final turn but was bested late for show.
 DOC ROSS saved ground from just off the rail and failed to threaten. MR. KALYPSO stalked the pacesetter outside and was done early.**TIMER
