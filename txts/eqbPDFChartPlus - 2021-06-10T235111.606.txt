 in a good effort. STORM REVELER put in a steady effort in an inside trip and was all out for show. LEFLORE COUNTY bobbled at the start to be away
 slowly, closed under strong urging and didn't have enough late. NICOLAS CAJUN showed good early speed while racing between horses, fell back to stalk
 the pace, hung in the lane and lost position. OUTLAW BY NATURE was not a factor. WHINING showed brief speed in an outside trip and did not threaten.

 Footnotes
 MY MAJESTY vied for the early lead, edged clear passing the quarter pole and drew out. MYSTICAL never far back, finished gamely for the place.
 PACKY'S OUT exchanged bumps at the start, raced between foes a sixteenth out and finished willingly. CURLY CREEK up close early four wide, raced in
 the five path into the lane and lacked the needed response. THE BOSS IS BACK raced in a bit close briefly in upper stretch and lacked the needed bid.
 TIMBER CRUISER bumped at the start, pressed three deep and weakened in the drive. CHAUN WITH A C exchanged bumps at the start, stayed outside
 and was seven wide into the lane then had no solid response. CRATER LAKE vied early, chased and tired in the drive. SCATTER THE MOON away a bit
 awkwardly, raced six wide entering the lane and tired. LITTLE MUSTARD saved ground and had no bid.

 squeezed and checked at the start, fell back, steadily advanced, was gaining fast late and bumped at the wire. HILL CROOME broke awkwardly and was
 impeded at the start, bid between horses on the turn, finished well and bumped at the wire. WAR CODE raced mid pack, went seven wide entering the
 stretch and lacked the needed rally. SPECTACULAR ONE raced close to the pace outside, went five wide entering the stretch, bid and hung. DOCS
