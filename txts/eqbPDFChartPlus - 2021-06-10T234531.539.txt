 Footnotes
 CLASSY TIZZY settled off the pace on the outside and started a bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, improved on the outside in the backstretch, rounded the
 far turn in the three path, dueled in the upper stretch and took the lead near the sixteenth pole, then widened her lead in the final sixteenth. RUMERS ARE
 TRUE was bumped by Little Tricky at the start, then rushed up and angled in to the rail to rate the pace inside, rounded the turn on the rail and was asked
 for more mid-turn, then dueled in the upper stretch but reluctantly ceded near the sixteenth pole. CHARITABLE STEP settled off the pace in the three path,
 started a bid near the seven-sixteenths pole and eased out to the five path at that point to improve on the outside, then angled in to the rail at the
 three-eighths pole and rounded the turn on the rail, but leveled off in the stretch. PAINTED ROCKET settled off the pace inside, eased out to the three path
 moving into the backstretch, started a bid near the seven-sixteenths pole, improved between horses then angled back to the rail at the three-eighths pole,
 then rounded the turn on the rail and leveled off in the lane. I'LL DO RIGHT settled well off the pace outside, started a bid at the three-eighths pole, rounded
 the turn in the five path, then swung out to the 7 path leaving the turn and dug in determinedly down the stretch to pass rivals and make significant gains
 and finish well. GRANDMA'S GHOST settled well off the pace inside, started a bid near the three-eighths pole, rounded the turn on the rail, but leveled off in
 the lane. LITTLE TRICKY broke in and bumped Rumers Are True at the start, then settled well back, started a bid leaving the seven-sixteenths pole, made a
 move on the outside but fell back in the turn on the rail, then passed a couple of tired rivals down the stretch but showed little further. MEMORIES OF LADY
 settled close off the pace outside, made a mild bid leaving the three-eighths pole, began dropping back moving into the far turn in the five path, then faded in
 the lane. HOMEMADE BRANDY settled off the pace outside, made a mild bid near the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the turn. CHIVE ON was through
 after a half.

 Footnotes
 ONEMORESWEETKISS hustled up to rate the pace in the six path, angled in to the three path through the turn, was headed leaving the turn, then dueled
 down the lane and just lasted for first. MOTHERNATURESPELL gave chase two wide between horses, rounded the turn in the three path, then drew to
 even terms leaving the turn and dueled down the lane but just missed first. KOBUK VALLEY gave chase three wide on the outside, took the turn in the five
 path, then dug in down the lane and just missed second. NAYEER gave chase in the seven path through the backstretch, angled in at the five-sixteenths
 pole to round the turn in the three path, then drove down the stretch and finished well. COCO COBANA gave chase outside, took the turn in the six path,
 swung out to the nine path leaving the turn and finished wide. BOMBAY BEACHES broke in the air and inward at the start, then quickly angled out to
 mid-track and raced wide throughout. SKIM THE RAIL was never a factor. PERFUME IN THE AIR gave chase inside, rounded the turn on the rail, then
 faded in the lane.

 Footnotes
 TRUE LIME was hurried clear toward the three eighths pole to rate the pace, came under pressure midway on the turn then steadily handled to widen. HE'S
 ROYAL chased the winner while racing off the rail, had aim midway on the turn but proved no match through the stretch. BLIXT gave chase five wide most
 of the backstretch, rounded the turn four wide and showed little further down the lane. LETCHER, a step slow to break, picked up the chase in the four and
 five paths then leveled off through the lane. COPELANS REVENGE engaged in close early chase after breaking a bit awkwardly then leveled off three wide
 on the turn. TALE OF A COMET quickly dropped back from a sharp break to give chase outside, drifted wider through the turn and entered the stretch about
 the eight path.

 ROMANTIC CORK settled off the pace outside, drew to even terms without encouragement at the three-eighths pole, was asked for more near the
 five-sixteenths and took the lead near the quarter pole, drew clear at the three-sixteenths pole, then drove down the lane and widened. GROOM
 SCHOLARSHIP settled off the pace inside, eased out to the three path and started her bid at the three-eighths pole, eased out more to the five path in the
 turn, then drove down the stretch and held for first. QUALITY MOVES settled off the pace three wide outside, drew to even terms near the three-eighths
 pole, dropped back a furlong later to round the turn in the three path, then drifted out down the stretch. PRINCESS PENELOPE stalked the pace inside,
 eased out to take the lead past the three-eighths pole, enjoyed a brief lead but was caught near the quarter pole while taking the turn on the rail, then dug in
 gamely but faded in the stretch. BABY'S DANCER rushed up to rate the pace outside, drew clear at the half pole and angled in to the rail, dueled briefly
 from the three-eighths pole but dropped back at the five-sixteenths pole and showed little further. LANDRA was never a factor.
