 Footnotes
 INFLEXIBILITY broke in line with the runner up, tucked into the two path once safely onto the main course, was patiently ridden stalking that opponent for
 the initial three-quarters, crept up approaching the quarter pole, went onward for another sixteenth before being given its cue, responded to take charge,
 steadily padded the margin, kept to encouragement to the wire. IN THE LEE grabbed control shortly after the start, cut over to the inside, was rated showing
 the way, with the eventual winner stationed to the outside off its hind quarters, saw the top one closing in approaching the quarter pole, reacted to that foe's
 impending challenge by spinning into the stretch under a drive, gave in however once INFLEXIBILITY was herself called upon, had plenty left to protect the
 place. BLESSED SILENCE (FR) took up the chase towards the two path, got roused swinging slightly wider into stretch, straightened away and was
 outfinished. FLIPCUP saved ground for the opening six furlongs, proceeded to be angled to the outside coming up to the five-sixteenths marker, was in path
 four a furlong later, had no offering.

 Footnotes
 PANAMA ED away well, pressed the issue from the two path, stayed within range of the second place finisher all throughout the opening half, was asked for
 more spinning into the lane, as was the nemesis, made little if any progress until nearing the sixteenth pole, paid no heed as HARD WAY WINNER came
 out slightly from left side pressure leaving that station and gamely got the job done. HARD WAY WINNER broke a length the quickest, and after being lightly
 urged for next several jumps, cut over to the inside, still in possession of that advantage, carved out the pace tailed by the top one to the outside, rider
 holding something back for the stretch drive, was let loose as the half was being completed, had nothing but success staving off the top one until the general
 area of the sixteenth pole, shifted out to the outer rim of path two after being fed some left side stick work beyond that station, winding up a whisker or
 thereabouts shy of leading the twosome to at least rub shoulders with each other, remained determined but got worn down late. BUSS THE BELL pursued
 the front runners from path three, stepped into the lane and was deep into the furlong grounds before getting asked for more, gave the desired response,
 continuing onward with willingness to secure the show. INDIAN GHOST stayed glued along the inside route after the start, had already been under some
 encouragement for the initial three furlongs prior to getting set down after reaching the midway point on the turn, angled out three wide right after finishing
 the half, proved no match. BACKSTRETCH GEORGE pulled hard while appearing unsettled racing between rivals on the backstretch, went about in more
 professional manner chasing the front runners two to three wide on the turn, fanned out into path five by midstretch, made no impact. DIAMOND SETTER
 failed to menace off what was basically a two wide trip. CONTROLLED FURY placed to a drive for the drive home, wound up saving ground to no avail.

 Footnotes
 MAJOR LEAGUE hustled after coming out of the starting gate, went at it head to head with a very aggresively-handled CHOSEN ONE ELIJAH during the
 initial stages, shook off that foe after the first fraction and edged away from the competition during the run around the bend, got put to a drive for the drive
 home, held sway. CALLANT off the inside throughout, closed the gap a bit while travelling three to four wide on the turn, swung slightly wider into the lane,
 failed to make headway but showed energy to secure second. AMERICAN ROAD got tipped into path two early down the backstretch, took up the chase
 while racing in midpack, got driven out into the six path from upper to midstretch, straightened away, narrowed in CALLANT but got held off for the place.
 ARCHIE was guided into path three after the start, got asked for more coming up to the five-sixteenths marker after having fallen back during the setting of
 the second split, fanned out wider and wider once into the stretch, until about seven wide, had some gain, although never posing a danger. PROPER
 FREUD two wide at the top of the turn, got spotted five wide at the head of the stretch, went on to mostly improve position. ADVENTIST in the three path
 and put to encouragement on the bend, tired. CHOSEN ONE ELIJAH gunned from the gate, went at it side by side with the winner for the opening fraction,
 remained forwardly placed for a half then steadily backed away. CASIGORDO quickly placed along the inside route after the start, cut the corner under a
 drive, had no rally. NO HIDING PLACE three wide both entering and exiting the turn, gave way.

 MORRISON broke well and was forwardly placed inside under reserve under pressure from ROCKIN JO to the outside, remained patiently handled through
 to the far turn, shook away given some rein to work with at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the
 eighth pole, held well to the finish to prevail. WAY EARLY just off the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing two to three wide at the five-sixteenths, swung
 three then two wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to chase the winner home, second best and well clear of the rest. BIG THICKET just off the
 inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide at the quarter pole, improved position for the show honors.
 ENGINEERS REPORT saved ground near the rear, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and passed tired foes
 in the drive. ANALYZE YOUR LUCK three wide in pursuit, tucked inside put to coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.
 ROCKIN JO prompted the pace two then three wide, came under urging shaken off at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, faltered in the
 lane. YEAR OF THE KITTEN four wide in the clear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, faded through the far turn, continued four wide into
 upper stretch and tired.

 RETONOVA off the inside throughout, stepped off the backstretch in the three path in his pursuit of the front runners and began narrowing in, was put to a
 drive shortly after the second fraction had been finalized, spun into the lane with some momentum, forged to the front during the run leading up to and then
 through the furlong grounds, kept going well, remaining under a drive until the last few jumps. SPECTACULAR KID cut over to the inside well before arriving
 at the conclusion of the backstretch, was put to brisker and brisker encouragement making his way around the bend until placed to a drive neariing the
 five-sixteeenth pole, angled to the outside heading for the top of the lane, only to have the move turn out to be a blind switch, inched its way towards the
 middle of the strip afterwards, desperately seeking, it seemed, an escape route in that direction, attained the desired seam a short distance beyond the
 furlong marker when the winner himself moved a bit to the inside, was given its cue, mustered up some energy but was held at bay. AQUA BEL SAR away
 without apparent mishap, stalked the leader from the two path, ranged up when set down after the half had been completed, turned for home in hot pursuit
 of the pacesetter, with the eventual winner latched on to the right, vied with vigour against two rivals as it turned out, at first with BELLEVILLE SPRING until
 near the three-sixteenths pole and then one on one with the top one till the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, failed to cement himself to the front and weakened
 into the show slot. SANTO ANTONIO had the rider take hold after the start, took up chase from the two path during the opening phases, angled into path
 four midpoint on the turn, swung into the stretch and had no rally. BELLEVILLE SPRING was pulling on the bit establishing control down the backstretch,
 continued along on the front end attended by the second place fnisher, saw that opponent increase its presence late on the bend, was put to a drive for the
 drive home, was overhauled soon afterwards and steadily backed away.

 SIGNIFICANT FORM established the front from the get go and showed the way rated along the inside through sensible splits under the accompaniment of
 COFFEE CRUSH to the outside but very little pressure, began to shake off that rival midway on the turn and widened through the latter portion of the bend
 under her own power, cut the corner and was roused into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive and was geared down in the final strides to the wire.
 WEALTH EFFECT saved ground at the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch before tipping out
 to the five path straightened away with three-sixteenths to go, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors tussling with SWEET STING to the wire
 while never threatening the winner. SWEET STING stumbled at the start, recovered to track the pace from the two path behind the cover of COFFEE
 CRUSH, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one, ran on knocking
 heads with the aforementioned foe through the final eighth, got bested for the place while clear for the show honors. OH ZAP tracked the pace along the
 inside behind the cover of the leader early on, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the stretch.
 COFFEE CRUSH attended the pace of SIGNIFICANT FORM latched on to the outside in the two path applying little pressure save her presence, began to
 be shaken off midway on the far turn and came under urging in response at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 LONG HAUL BAY forwardly placed springing from the starting gate, saw several revved-up opponents to the inside eager for the front end themselves and
 was got eased back, departed the backstretch from the four path, picked up interest and real estate during the last stages of the run around the bend,
 swung into the lane and was given his cue, began to drift inward working its way to the lead, eventually causing the runner up to get taken in hand and idle
 along for four to five jumps, kicked clear in the last eighth, crossing the wire under a hand drive. MIGHTY ZEALOUS stalked the front runners from path
 three, narrowed in on the ones to catch as the half was being completed, was called upon for more for the stretch run, got pinched by the wandering winner
 coming up to the furlong grounds, wound up getting taken in hand and forced to idle along for several strides, lightly urged, got going afterwards and
 finished with good courage to garner the place. WICKED MACHO took up residence in the pocket after brushing with SUMMER BOURBON at the start, was
 patiently ridden keeping an eye on the front runners, was forced to await usable options when caught in some traffic as the half was being completed,
 angled into freedom soon afterwards, made no headway and had to settle for the show. GLOBAL POSITIONING near the three path entering the turn,
 fanned to the outside spinning into the stretch, was lightly urged travelling eight wide down the lane going past rivals. SUMMER BOURBON brushed at the
 start, made it to the inside route in short order, appeared to brush the rail stepping onto the turn, slipped to the outside coming up to the five-sixteenths
 marker, angled five wide into the lane, lacked the needed late response. LOVE THAT JAZZ hung out in the three path and under being urged along on the
 turn, failed to make its presence felt. SAL THE TURTLE three wide at the three-eighths pole, was six wide by midstretch, made no impact. BLUE BELT took
 up the chase two wide on the turn and tired. TRIBECCA roused early, dueled inside for a half and faltered. FOR POPS urged out of the gate to attain a
 prominent position, sparred two wide for command to upper stretch, retreated after being overhauled.

 TOO MUCH DATA three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and had SHOWCASE
 MALL attempt to nudge his way out and denied the move getting bumped offstride, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong with a good kick and
 just got up in the final jump to the wire. OVERNIGHT SUCCESS three wide in pursuit from mid pack, advanced through the turn into striking range coming
 under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over command just inside the eighth pole, dug in under threat
 and was nailed in the final stride to the finish. HANGMAN three wide chasing from mid pack, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing
 three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. SPARKY prompted the pace two to
 three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, came inwards and forced THROW THE FADE to check with
 three-sixteenths to go, then ran on to secure the last major share. SHOWCASE MALL just off the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch attempting to bull his way out to the four path and was denied the move by TOO MUCH DATA, bumping
 that foe off stride straightened away for home, then offered up a mild bid through the stretch. INDIFFERENCE showed the way in hand inside under
 prompting through swift splits, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was headed inside the
 eighth pole, then got outfinished in the late stages. THROW THE FADE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, steadied at the
 quarter pole in a bit tight before cutting the corner into upper stretch, was on pause lacking optimal clearance inside of SPARKY when that foe came in and
 was forced to check at the three-sixteenths, altered out a path inside the eighth pole and finished in hand to the wire. METAPHORICAL chased two to three
 wide from near the rear under urging from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and made no impact. GARSOON brushed the near side stall at the
 start getting away slow, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch growing detached at the tail of the field, raced three wide through the turn and
 into upper stretch well behind and striding a bit green and trailed throughout while getting some education.
