 track. BAKU DANCER well rated rallied on the far turn bidding in close quarters between horses at the head of the stretch angling out for room responding
 well in the three path to save place. BOLD CHARMANT stalked the pace pressing up in bid on the far turn, vied between horses in upper stretch taking a
 short lead before hanging late in the four path. JOKER MAN off slowly lagged through the backside, swung out on the far turn gave a five wide rush then
 lost momentum in upper stretch finishing evenly. BALK stalked the pace giving chase on the far turn then weakened in the three path upper stretch.

 DAILY FEATURE went evenly rallying to bid on the turn, drew even abreast foe in upper stretch drawing out in the four path angling in a bit late. SHESA
 BAD BAD GIRL pressured the pace wresting the lead on the turn, digging in from the two path in upper stretch was overpowered holding well late to salvage
 place. MY VICTAURUSECRET broke sharply pressing an early lead ceding on the turn, weakened in upper stretch mustering enough to hold off the others
 from the rail. MARIE JOELLE slow early circled out to upper stretch finishing evenly six wide. GRADUATION GIFT was never involved. DAMA LEONA gave
 hard pursuit through the turn then gave way in upper stretch. COLLEENS STORM hopped breaking slowly struggling after.
