 outspinted to the lead, chased winner throughout but proving no match while best of the rest. SPINNING TOP chased top two throughout to no avail and
 settled for show. HOTTLILNUMBER was bumped at the start, tracked while drifting out of the turn and came up empty. WHISPER VICTOR never a factor.
 GLORY'S SECRET bore out at the start and bumped rival and was through early. MY TRUE PICK never a menace. KALIE'S GOLD was off slow and failed
 to threaten.
