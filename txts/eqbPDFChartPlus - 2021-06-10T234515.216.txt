 Footnotes
 COCKTAIL PARTY stumbled at the start, was always within striking distance, shifted four wide on the turn, responded with a burst of speed out near the
 middle of the racetrack to make the lead in deep stretch and won going away. MY SOLDIER GIRL pressed the pace along the inside for a half, shook clear
 at the top of the stretch, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. JILTED RUNAWAY unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the
 eight path. SHELTOWEE'S LOCA failed to menace. ADONAI POWER trailed until deep stretch then passed tiring rivals. KISS ME CANDY set a pressured
 pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. FLAT OUT SUPER was hustled along to be a forward factor four wide into the turn then weakened.
 FASHIONEDTAYLOR was through after a half. SHELTOWEE'S DINERO stumbled at the start unseating her rider.

 Footnotes
 COTTONWOOD CANYON allowed to settle, closed willingly in the five path on the far turn, made the lead before mid stretch, drew off and won under mild
 urging. TRUE TRUFFLE stalked the pace from between horses around the clubhouse turn, assumed command, set the pace into the stretch, altered course
 outside the winner late and finished second best. FATHER DENNIS unhurried early, swerved near mid stretch and closed a gap late in the eight path. MY
 MAN DAN offered a mild bid entering the stretch then leveled off. JOLSON pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, led briefly between called,
 remained a sharp threat into the stretch then faded. KID TWIST well placed, lacked the needed response. OVERSIZED moved up on the second turn then
 came up empty. WICHITA WILLY was outrun. SECRET INVASION had speed for a half then flattened out. CLAMPDOWN showed little. TIN CAT broke in
 front, set the pace for nearly a half, remained a sharp threat for six furlongs then folded. HOARDER was never close. Due to timer malfunction only the final
 time was hand timed.

 Footnotes
 ADA LOVELACE was bumped hard and forced in at the start, settled within striking distance, closed determinedly in the five path through the stretch and
 got up in the final strides. ONE CLASSIE QUAY away alertly, dueled for the lead in the three path into the stretch, shook clear and just missed hanging on.
 DOLLY MAE close up, loomed boldly along the rail entering the stretch then was outfinished. FANCY HAT TRICK bore in badly at the start bumping rivals,
 was outrun into the stretch then closed a gap late. GOLDEN JUSTICE allowed to settle, loomed boldly outside on the turn then leveled off. WEEKEND
 MELODY pressed the pace along the inside into the turn, made the lead, had speed until mid stretch then came up empty. JOMARY'S THE GREAT loomed
 boldly three wide on the turn then gave way. SHORTYS TRAIN stalked the pace three wide and was through after a half. FAIR ASTRONOMER was no
 factor. COCONUT POP was bumped at the start, trailed well back and swung wide then passed a tiring one. ANGELSMADISONGRACE had speed along

 Footnotes
 DANCE ON STAGE unhurried early, advanced steadily in the four path, engaged the leaders four wide at the top of the stretch, battled to the wire and got
 up in the final strides. SHORT MEMORIES had speed from the start, rallied four wide into the stretch, made the lead, battled to the wire and just missed
 hanging on. FAMILLE TROIS never far back, had a mild late rally four wide. REWARD'S GIRL settled mid pack, loomed boldly along the rail entering the
 stretch then failed to sustain her bid. ELITE EYES failed to menace. SWEET PLEBE passed tiring rivals. MY DEAR NOBLE pressed the pace two wide into
 the turn, made the lead then came up empty. DONA MARITZA had brief speed. SHOW THE WORLD was no factor. MT HAYNESFIELD stalked the pace
 two wide for a quarter and was through early. PAULSEZWHATSUPAL was hustled to the lead under right handed urging, set the pace along the inside into
 the turn then was used up. WINTER D'AMOUR was outrun.
