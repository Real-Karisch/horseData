 Footnotes
 SUMNER away alertly, grabbed the advantage, was rated along the rail feeling the presence of a pair of opponents parked to the outside, relinquished and
 fell back slightly as three-quarters was being completed, got cued up and proceeced to angle to the outside a sixteenth later, swung wider and wider, no
 doubt influenced as his fellow front runners were drifting/shifting much wider too, straightened away towards path seven and mustered up a comeback to
 forge to the top with a furlong to go, put away the runner up for good after a few additional strides and edged away. FILLET OF SOLE got brushed from
 between opponents after losing his footing springing from the starting gate, vied as the widest of three, from path three for the opening six furlnogs, rider
 keeping something in reserve, tagged along with BROCKTON GEORGE going by the eventual winner coming up to the midway point of the far turn,
 appeared cooperative getting floated into path six by BROCKTON GEORGE during the going from the five-sixteents pole to the three-sixteenths marker,
 vied briefly with the top one for the lead in midstretch, got shaken off, yet finished way ahead of the others for place honors. BROCKTON GEORGE brushed
 right after the field had had been sent on its way, broke forwardly placed nonetheless, pressed the pace in two path from between rivals for nearly
 three-quarters, went to the top at the three-eighths pole, began getting out shortly afterwards, wandered out towards path four by the five-sixteenths marker,
 got overhauled, retreated down the lane, rider applying a firm grip on the left side to limit some additional waywardness. RUN BAYOU BIRD made light
 contact with the second place finisher in the shadow of the starting gate, cut over to the inside early on the clubhouse bend, sat reserved from afar keeping
 an eye on the front runners, was under some encouragement judiciously cutting the corner into the lane as the ones to catch all were spinning into it via
 much wider routes themselves, failed to reel any of them in. SCATOGA checked after coming in slightly at the break, was guided over to the rail in short
 order, abandoned it at the head of the backstretch, came up empty when asked for more at the half mile pole, arrived at the top of the lane and retreated.

 under a right-handed whip, took the lead outside the furlong marker then shook clear inside that marker, raced under the whip until inside the sixteenth-pole
 then was placed under a hand ride in the final forty yards while best. TRULY COURAGEOUS came away in good order, set the pace under pressure to her
 outside, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear into the stretch, came under a right-handed whip nearing the furlong marker, lost the lead to the winner
 at that point and was outfinished while just able to hold the place. RECONSIDER IT settled off the pace, was roused in the three path early on the turn then
 angled to the five path, came six wide into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place. PAZ THE WINE was urged along off the pace, raced
 inside to the two path on the turn, waited while blocked behind traffic from the top of the stretch to inside the furlong marker, altered course to the outside for
 room outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage but lost her best chance. LETS DANCE SOME MO bumped with a rival at the start, chased
 the pace, raced in the three path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and also finished willingly
 but missed the superfecta. CATANIA ROSE broke near the back of the field, was urged along while well back on the outside, angled seven wide into upper
 stretch and improved position without threatening. NAZAY was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, pursued the leader under the whip
 into the final furlong and weakened. FIVEINTHEMORNING broke out and bumped with an opponent, chased the pace on the inside, saved ground on the
 turn, brushed with PUFFIN PATTY near the three-sixteenths and came up empty. PUFFIN PATTY bumped lightly with a rival at the start then bobbled early,
 showed good speed to press the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, brushed with FIVEINTHEMORNING near the three-sixteenths and
 tired. SEATTLE FROST was ridden along off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, came under the whip in upper stretch and
 failed to rally. UCONNMARSH was taken up briefly early then urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, came three wide into the
 stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. LULU'S PARTNER was off slow and spotted the front of the field around five lengths, went two to three wide on

 ELIZABETH NICOLE to the outside, had that rival advance and dueled through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
 for home, reclaimed command straightened away and edged away under a drive kept to task. SHE'SAKITTYKAT coaxed from the start, chased along the
 inside, got taken in hand when in tight to the inside of ANIMAUXSELLE at the nine-sixteenths, had IMPAZIBLE CREE attempt to get out through the turn in
 front and briefly steadied once more off that rival's heels before tipping out three wide at that station put to urging, spun just off the inside for home, drifted to
 the rail nearing the eighth pole before being taken out nearing the sixteenth marker to the three path and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors.

 Footnotes
 FACTOR THIS away in good order, cut over to the inside after establishing control, showed the way, lightly hand urged, initially attended by GLASS
 BRIDGE and then afterwards by KILLEEN, each out towards path two, got turned loose turning into the stretch, arrived at the eighth pole with MORNING
 STRIDE having dead aim, dug in with determination to fend that foe off, kept busy to the wire. MORNING STRIDE was coaxed along keeping watch on the
 front runners from the pocket, got cued up commencing to angle to the outside approaching the quarter pole, settled into path two and took off in earnest
 after the winner, was hitched up as the final furlong began, fought on with willingness, but got staved off. KILLEEN strung out three wide on the first turn,
 moved up and into the two path, taking over the role of the primary pursuer after entering the backstretch, was set to a brisk hand ride at the three-eighths
 pole before being switched over a drive a sixteenth down the road, remained a prominent factor for a little while longer before giving way. ON PATROL
 remained along the inside route after the field had been sent on its way, slipped to the outside shortly after the third fraction was being finalized, headed two
 wide into the lane under a full drive, had no rally. ZAP DADDY underwent a two to three wide to the end of the second bend, got called for more after six
 furlongs had been completed, stepped into the stretch and backed away. GLASS BRIDGE positioned in path two, disputed the pace until early on the
 backstretch, was then between rivals the rest of the journey leading up to the half mile pole, finished six furlongs and folded.

 Footnotes
 SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN bobbled at the start, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, rallied five wide on the far turn, closed
 strongly to get the lead outside the quarter-pole then quickly kicked clear under a left-handed whip, switched to his proper lead outside the furlong marker,
 was switched to a right-handed whip just inside that marker, widened under the whip into the final sixteenth then was placed under a brisk hand ride while
 much the best. DOUPS POINT rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, advanced on the far turn while moving from the three path to
 the six path, hesitated while trying to give relief to horses in tight quarters to his inside coming to the quarter-pole and secured the place while no match for
 the winner. EARLY RETIREMENT went around the first turn in the two to three path, dragged his way forward late on that bend to contest the pace on the
 outside, drew off in tandem with THE GLOMINATOR to open a sizable advantage, shortened stride in the two path on the far turn, dropped back into upper
 stretch and tired but held the show. IMPAZIBLE ODDS saved ground on the first turn, was urged along while outside on the backstretch, advanced while
 moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, swerved some in traffic around the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch then leaned in
 some and weakened. DASHING DAN broke in the air and was off very slow, spotted the front of the field at least six lengths, saved ground on the first turn,
 lagged at the rear, advanced while moving from the two to the five path on the far turn, steadied off heels at the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch
 then drifted out, ducked out near the furlong marker and had nothing left. CRAZY LIFE raced inside early on the first turn then moved to the two path, was
 urged along on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the far turn, leaned in some just after turning into the stretch and capitulated. PIER FORTY went four
 wide early on the first turn then dropped to the two path, jumped marks on the track outside the five-eighths pole, was urged along well off the pace,
 advanced two to three wide on the far turn, shifted five wide into the stretch and faltered. THE GLOMINATOR was asked leaving the gate, moved in while
 going to the front, contested the pace on the inside, drew off in tandem with EARLY RETIREMENT to open a sizable advantage, shortened stride along the
 rail on the far turn and stopped. TAPTAPTAP was taken in hand early then became very rank while wrestled back against the rail, continued under very
 vigorous restraint then moved out into the first turn, raced in the three to four path while still rank on that bend, dropped back under urging early on the
 backstretch, advanced in the two then three path on the far turn, came up empty into the stretch and also faltered. (Rail at 18 Feet) THIS RACE WAS
 SCHEDULED FOR ONE MILE AND ONE SIXTEENTH BUT WAS RUN AT ONE MILE AND ONE FURLONG DUE TO THE GATE BEING PLACED IN THE
 WRONG LOCATION. FRACTIONAL AND FINAL TIMES ARE ARE UNAVAILABLE.

 Footnotes
 TIZNOW'S SMILE saved ground at the tail of the field tipping off the rail to the two path put to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out four to five wide
 into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily closing in, then surged home through the final sixteenth to gobble up ground late and was just up in the final
 jump to score. LADY BERGEN bumped at the start by SANDY BELLE and in turn bumped BABY BOSS, vied between foes from the three path early on
 before shaking off SANDY BELLE in concert with BABY BOSS into the turn, dueled to the inside of that rival from the two path under coaxing from just past
 the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, shook clear under a drive to the eighth pole, began to shorten her stride growing leg weary inside the
 final sixteenth, drifted out under imploring near sided stick work and was nailed on the wire and forced to settle for the place honors. BABY BOSS bumped
 at the start by LADY BERGEN due to pressure from SANDY BELLE, vied from the four path with a pair to her inside early on before shaking away in
 tandem with LADY BERGN into the turn, dueled to the outside of that rival under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, got shaken off a bit nearing the quarter
 pole, swung three to four wide at that station and weakened in the late stages. SANDY BELLE broke out at the start bumping LADY BERGEN into BABY
 BOSS, vied inside that pair early on from the two path before being shaken off into the turn, chased two to three wide on that bend under coaxing from three
 furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. HELD ACCOUNTABLE four to five wide down the backstretch, tucked inside half a
 mile from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. CAMORRA coaxed along three to four wide in pursuit, angled five to six wide
 into upper stretch, tired.

 CAPE ANGEL dove over to the rail after the start, spun to the outside entering the backstretch, tipped wider by the top of the second turn and closed in with
 good energy, shifted slightly to the inside as three-quarters was being completed, was given his cue and challeged in earnest in possesion of clear sailing
 along the two path, took charge during the ensuing furlong, then edged away from a pair of bumping rivals the remainder of the way home. FLYOFF
 unhurried in path two during the initial stages, swung three onto the backstretch, was just as wide exiting it, sat witihin range of the pacesetter, picked up
 interest as three-quarters was being completed, followed the leader, that being CHARNLEY RIVER, by swinging much wider into the lane himself, briefly
 settling in towards path six, came in, iniating some contact with FUEL THE BERN in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, came in more significantly
 a few strides later, leaning on and herding the previously-mentioned foe a couple of paths closer to the inside, saw the twosome brush each inside the
 sixteenth pole, in this final instance both bearing some responsibility, forged on ahead to be the second to cross the finish line. FUEL THE BERN workied
 out a tuck into path two stepping onto the clubhouse bend, went on to stalk the pacesetter, getting rated along, sprang to life as did all of the closest
 pursuers during the final stages of the run around the far turn, observed the leader dritting out several paths heading home, did the same, angling into path
 five into the lane himself, arrived into it directly to the left of FLYOFF, got brushed into by that rival soon afterwards, made it to midlane then got carrired two
 or so paths to the inside due to sustained contact from the same opponent, was coming out a bit, trying to hold his ground, as the errant nemeis was once
 again resuming a course to the inside past the sixteenth pole, resulting in a light bump between them, held on well. LA MAQUINA GRIS abandoned the
 inside route midway on the backstretch, moved by HIGH MOON to take over the pocket in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, got called upon cutting the
 corner into the lane, flattened out. BLURRED LINE managed to get set up in path two right after arriving at the end of the homestretch, stayed put towards
 the back of the pack, was angled to the outside a few strides shy of the quarter pole, rallied midlly to mainly improve position. THE DOW pulling hard early,
 travelled three wide on both turns, lacked the needed response. HIGH MOON faltered off a ground-saving journey. CHARNLEY RIVER (AUS) showed the
 way from along the rail, sputtered four wide getting overwhelmed coming into the stretch and faded. Followng a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the stretch
 drive, FLYOFF was disqualified from second and placed third for causing interference.

 Footnotes
 J J'S DREAMING was hustled to the lead, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace, controlled the tempo in the three path
 on the far turn, was roused while extending the advantage near the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch then was put to a right-handed whip, drew
 off under a drive into the final sixteenth then was put to a hand ride while much the best. SPEKE broke out and hit the gate solidly then bumped with a rival,
 went around the first turn in the four path, tracked the winner on the outside under coaxing, came under stronger encouragement around the half-mile pole,
 chased the winner under the whip in the four path on the far turn, floated six wide into the stretch and weakened but earned the place. KERRY BOY went
 around the first turn in the five path, settled on the outside, was urged along in the four path on the far turn, dropped to the three path under a drive into the
 stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. DANNY CALIFORNIA was bumped at the start while off a step slow, went two to three wide
 under restraint on the first turn, settled down the backstretch, was urged along in the three path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and faltered.
 FULLBACK FOYE went three wide early on the first turn then dropped to the rail, fell well behind, saved ground under urging on the far turn and showed
 little.

 Footnotes
 WORLD OF TROUBLE broke out at the start and was pulled off the slower breaking MAJESTIC DUNHILL, came under hustling and showed the way just off
 the inside down the backstretch lightly coaxed along until tucked to the inside into the turn, came under some pressure to the outside midway through the
 bend, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive holding well and inching away to the wire kept to task. FIG JELLY broke out at the start and was
 corrected before making any contact, came under coaxing in pursuit three then two wide from just off the pace, tucked inside into the turn and set up right in
 behind the aforementioned stable and barnmate, followed that one through the turn, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out a furlong out to the three
 path and ran on to get up for the place honors in the final jumps. DIRTY broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, chased five wide down
 the backstretch from in close range, tucked three wide into the turn, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home,
 kept on through to the line but was collared for the place honors in the final jumps. TOTALLY BOSS six paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit
 from mid pack, came under coaxing tucked three wide at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major
 share. STOLEN PISTOL crossed to the three path shortly after the start and chased three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole while near the rear,
 angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to close in too late to impact the top quartet. NEW LEGEND (KOR) four wide in pursuit, got
 coaxed along with half a mile remaining, swung five wide into upper stretch and failed to quicken. COLTANDMISSISSIPPI four to five wide at the tail of the
 field, came under coaxing half a mile from home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the drive. LIKE WHAT I SEE coaxed
 along chasing three then two wide from mid pack, angled four wide at the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. MAJESTIC DUNHILL off half a beat slow
 lunging a bit at the break, chased along the inside until angled out five wide at the top of the stretch, was unable to make an impact. SHANGROYAL coaxed
 from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the get go, cornered three wide for home, weakened in the drive. A DIFFERENT STYLE
 coaxed along in pursuit just off the inside in mid pack, spun three wide into upper stretch, tired. CLOUDED JUDGEMENT coaxed from the gate, raced
 forwardly placed along the inside, got shaken off into the turn and faded through the bend coaxed along, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 WILD COLONIAL BOY pursued the fornt runners three wide, crept up during the final stages of the run around the bend, was given its cue spinning into the
 lane, won the duel with GIANT BOO BOO and kicked clear. GIANT BOO BOO had control established before the first fraction had been finalized, showed
 the way rated along, got called upon for more turning into the lane, with the eventual winner looming a threat, gap-dueled that foe down the lane,
 relinquished and had to settle for being second best. LATIN LOVE BUG travelled four wide on the turn, tipped a few paths wider after finishing the trip to the
 quarter pole then rallied down the middle of the strip (six wide) to finish a non-threatening third. THERESA'S BOY in range two wide, proved no match.
 AMERICAN NINJA two to three wide on the turn, made no impact. DAB came inward springing from the starting gate, wa manuevered to the outside after
 becoming rank soon afterwards, took up the chase towards path three, swung into the lane and failed to muster up a response. SUDDEN VICTORY three
 wide on the turn, never made its presence felt. THEFINALCRAZYDUDE prompted the pace for sligthly over a half, swerved in twice between the
 three-sixteenths marker and midstretch backing away. ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN shied in slighlty at the start, was moved into path two before arrving at
 the conclusion of the backstretch, failed to menace. GOLDEN SEQUENCE off the inside, failed to contend, then was ponied back, returning in distress.
 TAMZINE hustled along early, took the inside route, displayed brief speed before retreating. NEUTRAL ZONE under the whip early on the backstretch,
 remained unmotivated, sat parked out five wide on the turn, hever reaching a contending position.
