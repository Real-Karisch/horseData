 Footnotes
 MARINO'S WILD CAT broke in stride and dueled outside MR JAY D, disposed of that rival into the lane then met a bid from SOLAR TEX, appeared beaten
 in mid stretch but dug back in and refused to give way. SOLAR TEX settled in the early going, advanced three wide on the turn, .loomed a bold factor a
 furlong out but could not get by the winner. MR. JAY D prompted the winner from the inside to the stretch and faltered. FREEDOM HILL stalked four wide
 for a half and gave way. INCLINE VILLAGE bobbled leaving the gate, raced up and checked inside foes nearing the half mile pole, fell back and showed no
 more interest.

 driving while going away. BLAZING IMAGE set all of the pace from the inside, tried to resist the winner leaving the furlong pole but finally faded late.
 ARGYLE CUT settled early, raced three wide on the first turn, four wide on the second and had a mild late rally. EXTENSIVE settled inside, gave way two
 wide on the second turn. UNION LEGEND pressed the pace two wide and came up empty. ZIRONDELLE flashed speed for a half mile only.

 Footnotes
 FOUR LEAF emerged from between horses after the break to gain command from off the rail, set all of the pace, edged clear nearing the stretch and had
 enough to hold. INFORMANT was never too far back, raced four wide into the lane and was gaining at the wire. SHE BEGAN AGAIN raced unhurried early,
 was forced five wide to the stretch and closed a minor gap. MILLENNIUM BREW stalked from the rail, had a brief bid into the lane but flattened out. DIXIE
 SPICE pressed the winner from the three path to the stretch and gave way. SHESA RANEGADE was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 STORM FASHION gained command in the opening strides and set all of the pace well off the rail, responded in the upper stretch and drew clear, driving.
 LUCKY VIEWS was never too far back , saved ground on both turns but lacked the needed response. CANADA stalked the winner from the three path into
 the lane and failed to respond. UNUSUALLY BIG was unhurried early, angled four wide on the second turn but did not rally. NAHEM raced three and four
 wide throughout and showed little in a dull effort. OUTDOORSMAN GENE was never a factor.

 PERFECT FOR ME broke alertly and dueled outside SILKEN QUEEN well in hand, quickly drew clear into the stretch then had enough in reserve to
 withstand late bids. OUR BOLD PRINCESS stalked from the outside, did not go with the winner into the stretch but was gaining late. ADMONITION settled
 early, was fanned five wide on the turn then found her best stride too late. SILKEN QUEEN dueled from the rail to the stretch and gave way. ROYAL
 LOOKIN saved ground to no avail. WELL SPOKEN LADY broke alertly but fell back and never threatened. CLASSY LIL REBEL was not asked for speed
 early, was fanned six wide on the turn and had no response.

 MEADOWLARK THUNDER broke in stride and dueled for the lead outside a three horse spread, continued to battle with STORMIN GA into and through the
 lane and proved best late. STORMIN G A dueled between rivals to the stretch and gradually weakened in the final stages. THISONESFORDANNY settled
 early, tried to rally four wide into the lane but lacked the needed response. MACANDOO was well place early inside horses, but failed to respond while in
 the three path entering the lane. LET'S HAVANUTHER lagged to the stretch, angled out and closed a minor gap late. WOODFORD SURPRISE showed
 little. CAPTIVE SECRETS dueled from the rail but was through after a half mile. A NEFARIOUS CAT was never a factor.
