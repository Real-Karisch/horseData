 Footnotes
 CORFU LADY quickly showed in front to set all the pace along the inside, opened up in mid stretch and was kept to task late winning convincingly. WELLS
 NOTICE tracked around the bend, rallied along the rail in mid stretch, gained second place in a good effort. LILY'S SECRET broke well stalking the winner
 racing three wide, lacked needed late kick and was fully extended holding onto third place. POQUITO ROSE settled in mid pack saving ground, angled out
 in mid stretch hitting stride, surged belatedly narrowly missing third place. SOUTHERN N' SASSY well placed tracking around the turn, came four wide
 giving chase upper stretch, lacked response beating others. SUR EMPIRE (GB) pressed the winner to top of the stretch, weakened inside the eighth pole.
 SURELY DIMPLE trailed soon after the start, hugged the rail throughout, showed belated interest in deep stretch but never factored. DANCING QUEENIE
 settled in the second flight, swung out seven to eight wide in upper stretch, failed to factor. PERSONAL CAT lacked speed offering little.

 MOON IN MY SHINE stalked the pace to the far turn rallying to hook the pacesetter in upper stretch, wore foe down edging clear in the four path. TACO
 WAYNE'S SHOT went evenly to the far turn angling out into upper stretch rallying six wide saving place. CYCLONE BETTY pressed the pace taking the
 lead on the backside saving ground to upper stretch, dueling in the two path came up a bit short. DIRT ROAD PRINCESS slow early came four wide in
 upper stretch angling out a bit while vying evenly late. A FREDDIE ZAPPER slow early gained modestly late in the three path. REBA'S RIGHT a step slow
 throughout played no factor. PARIS MOUNTAIN outrun through the far turn was taken eight wide in upper stretch. RUNNING CLOUD pressed the pace to
 the far turn then tired the final eighth. CISCO BAY failed to respond. YENOM NEVE was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 PENCE bobbled at the break and quickly recovered, hustled to stalk the leader down the backside, vied turning for home, edged clear in mid stretch and
 was under a drive holding safe to the wire. ROMANTIC CHANNEL raced up close from the start traveling along the rail, vied in a three way battle at the
 quarter pole, menaced to deep stretch, tired a bit a the wire just saving second place. BLACK CIRCLE settled in the second flight at mid track, came six
 wide in upper stretch, closed willingly to dead heat for third place. ZA WOODMAN unhurried and trailed to top of the lane, found stride rallying strongly
 coming to the wire to dead heat for third place. GRADUATED set a pressured pace throughout, headed from both sides at the quarter pole, weakened
 inside the eighth pole. HAT IN THE RING well placed going down the backside, moved between foes in upper stretch, needed more late despite being hard
 ridden. THORNADO settled towards the rear, angled out seven wide top of the lane, failed to threaten. STORMIN COWBOY rated early traveling in the
 second flight along the inside, came out five wide under a drive top of the stretch, failed to respond. TREE FIRE tracked running between foes, gave chase
 at the quarter pole, lacked response fading in the final sixteenth.

 Footnotes
 OVERHOLD angled in shortly after the start, rallied along the rail at the quarter pole vying for the lead, took over in upper stretch and increased the margin
 late under steady urging. HOLY CHROME rushed hard into the far turn, drew even for the lead near the quarter pole, battled with the winner to mid stretch,
 tired inside the eighth pole barely holding onto second place. ICE BLUE VISION unhurried from the gate racing towards the rear, rallied along the rail in
 upper stretch, closed willingly narrowly missing second place. BLACK IS BACK settled towards the rear, bid between foes in mid stretch, surged late
 missing a minor award. SAMMY BE COOL broke a bit outward, settled in mid pack, bid three wide upper stretch, leveled off needing more late. AMUSE
 THE DIVA was squeezed taking up briefly at the start, trailed around the bend, came five wide entering the stretch, moved in tandem for a minor share but
 flattened out needing more late. TIZ ANNA RAE sent hard holding a slight early lead, headed near the quarter pole, relinquished control and drifted wide in
 upper stretch while giving way. MYSTICAL TEMPLE pressed to mid turn, gave way leaving the quarter pole, finished spent.

 Footnotes
 BLUEMOONOFSARATOGA vied abreast a pair of rivals mid turn, drove clear at the quarter pole, drew off being kept to task traveling in the three path.
 SHEZA RULER unhurried early traveling along the inside, angled out five wide under a drive upper stretch, rallied willingly picking up second place in a
 good effort. SPECIAL OF COURSE well placed from the start, tracked a trio of duelers to the quarter pole, came three wide taking aim in upper stretch,
 leveled off and was edged for second place. SWEET HALL settled in mid pack, mildly bid running between foes in the lane but needed more to make a real
 impact. GOLDILOCKS PLANET rushed dueling for the early lead running between foes, began to tire inside the eighth pole proving no late threat. RISKY'S
 BEST lacked early foot traveling towards the rear, slightly improved placing running at mid track but never menaced. STARDUST SKIES settled in the
 second flight, varied little never threatening. APPEALINGMAGIC was hard used fighting for the early lead, began to drop off leaving the quarter pole, used
 up. CATCH THAT DREAM trailed throughout, failed to factor.

 Footnotes
 CHRISTOPHER'S JOY set the pace through the turn, hooked in upper stretch ceded the lead then came back inside of rival to prevail gamely. SLEWS
 LOVE stalked close up angling out on the turn, hooked foe to lead abreast in mid stretch only to be out gamed at the end. MR. FUZZYBOTTOM chased the
 pace racing inside to upper stretch, extending late would finish evenly. SPLENDID BEHAVIOR raced evenly through the turn coming four wide in upper
 stretch lacking needed surge. ROCKET BALL slow early lost ground to upper stretch proving no menace in the seven path. LION HALL a step slow early
 played no factor. STREET PARADE was never involved. TO THE TOP N BACK breaking slowly was always outrun. ONLY I KNOW outrun early would tire.
