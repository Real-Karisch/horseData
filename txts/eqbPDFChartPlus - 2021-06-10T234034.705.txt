 SEAMS DISCREET forced the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, eased back through the turn, stayed along the inside, re-rallied and edged
 clear for the win. THREE DIAMONDS stalked the early pace, angled out five wide through the turn, was no match late for the winner and finished second
 best. JUST LOOKIN AROUND set a pressured early pace, raced between rivals into the turn and weakened late. QUEENS TIARA was not far back early,
 went six wide into the turn and offered a mild late rally. SUPER ONE pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn and tired in the drive. FIRELIGHT
 was outrun early, circled eight wide through the turn and was empty late. ENVIROMANIAC was unhurried early, went three wide into the turn and offered no
 late rally. OLD FASHIONED GAL was never a factor. KATHY'S DAY RATE was never a threat.
