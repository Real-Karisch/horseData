 BOASTER saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, took the nod past the
 eighth, raced clear mid-stretch and held on well. NATURAL ODDS raced boxed off the heels of Potential Grizzly through the opening turn then settled off
 the pace leaving the turn, bid past the three eighths pole, lacked room nearing the quarter pole but recovered stride at the rail through the far turn, eased out
 into the lane then dueled for second. JEFFERY SCOTT settled off the early pace about the three path then challenged three wide past the seven sixteenths
 pole, continued in close chase from that point, rounded the far turn in the five path and was just up for show. POTENTIAL GRIZZLY rated a slim lead inside,
 came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage at the rail rounding the far turn but was caught past the eighth pole and
 flattened stride the final sixteenth. SIENTE EL VIENTO raced off the pace in the three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch.
 TRUFFLES AND GOLD stalked the early pace two deep, challenged while between horses leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened from the mid
 point of the far turn.

 BEST TO BE ME set a pressured pace inside, contested the edge at the rail rounding the turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. MALIBU SPLASH
 was forced inward leaving the gate then picked up the chase inside and dueled through the stretch for second. CHEESE LOUISE gave close chase through
 the backstretch then angled out past the mid point of the turn, entered the stretch in the six path and was outfinished in the duel for second. COMMCAT
 chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn in the three path then flattened stride. BUFF N gave chase off the rail and showed little more in the lane.
 WALKNTHEPLANK was only briefly close then faded. SINGING HARMONY pressured the pace through the backstretch, dueled at a close disadvantage
 two deep rounding the turn then weakened past the eighth pole. SECRET CASTLE ducked in at the break then angled to the outside to give chase and was
 not a factor.

 Footnotes
 TAMAQUA stalked the pace from the three path then took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure toward the three eighths, raced
 clear past the five sixteenths to extend the advantage through the far turn then dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. CUBIC SOUND raced well
 off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took over second midway on the far turn and was gaining on the
 winner. ZEHAVI saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
 about the three path but showed little further. BOOK ON ME settled well off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole,
 rounded the far turn in the five path and could only improve his position. SWING BATTER accelerated to the lead while angling toward the inside and rated
 the pace from the five eighths pole, ceded the nod toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave close chase from that point but dropped back leaving the five
 sixteenths pole and faded on the far turn. TWEET THIS became fractious and was badgered in the gate then saved ground off the pace and showed little
 response to steady encouragement rounding the far turn. SWEETIN BREAD stalked the early pace off the rail then gave chase into the backstretch, but,
 dropped back past the three eighths pole and faded at the rail rounding the far turn. ELEANOR'S DIAMOND was never in contention.
