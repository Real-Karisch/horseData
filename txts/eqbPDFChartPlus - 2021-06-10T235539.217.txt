 STARSHIP APOLLO applied pace pressure to DR HARLAN out of the gate then dueled for lead going by half mile marker, cleared on top mid-way through
 turn still unleashed, roused for more entering top stretch, widened advantage, drifted out wider then kept clear. BIG BOY BRUNO settled off early pace then
 hustled up along outside near quarter pole, drifted out wide in stretch and finished well. DR HARLAN held slim lead in opening stages then dueled for top
 spot racing inside of STARSHIP APOLLO, could not match strides with eventual winner midway through turn but continued steady effort for share. ONE
 FINE RIDE raced in range through early stages, driving two path in the turn then evened out in stretch. TEMPTER tracked the early pace, driving inside
 upper stretch and lacked needed response to threaten. SCAM stalked through backstretch, launched three wide bid for top pair in the turn, could not reach
 rivals then gave way in lane. MR. PINOCCHIO raced in the back saving ground then shifted and put to drive to no avail.

 PASSION PLUS was well rated racing off quick running top pair, closed the gap in final turn, cleared the lead upper stretch then kept on gamely under
 driving finish. AQUEMINI was unhurried racing in the back, hustled up along outside in final turn, set down driving five wide a furlong out and steadily gained
 to wire. VENEZUELAN FOREVER raced four wide off quick top pair, hustled up three wide in final turn, continued steady bid into stretch then held show in
 final strides. CASSIDY'S SMILE saved ground racing off the quick top pair, came under a ride along inside at three eighths pole had to wait briefly at quarter
 pole, angled out then shifted wider a furlong out, lost whip near sixteenth pole and just missed show. PILLANGO had to wait and go around weakening rival
 in far turn, roused up closer along inside in final furlong then evened out late. ANABELLA QUEEN raced off the pace, hustled up along outside in far turn,
 took closer order then faded. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN set quick pace and dueled for the lead with REAGAN'S ODYSSEY, raced double digits over next
 pursuer, shook free in far turn then had nothing left in lane. REAGAN'S ODYSSEY raced quick on top dueling for lead racing well clear over next pursuer,
 was too much too soon and retreated in far turn.

 Footnotes
 JALEN JOURNEY vied for lead out of the chute, set a quick pressured pace through early stages then widened advantage still unleashed in turn, hustled up
 entering stretch then drew off under right handed pressure, kept on willingly then ridden out in final sixteenth to sharp victory. SOUPER CATCH rated along
 outside through early stages, came under a ride four wide late turn, no match for drawing off winner but continued steady bid and got up late to take place.
 BABY I'M PERFECT applied pace pressure to JALEN JOURNEY through the backstretch, chased after rival into stretch then edged late for place and
 cleared share. ZIPPY bumped at start, raced five wide in the back, urged along outside in turn and gained position without threatening. GRISACEO chased
 then pace and raced between rivals at half mile marker, failed to advance in turn then faded in lane. TUNE IN chased the pace along inside then retreated.
 STRATOSPHERE bumped with rival at start then forwardly positioned racing just off leader, hustled up three wide in the turn then had nothing left in lane.

 path through turn then flattened in stretch. LADY VALENTINA hustled up from get-go, raced in range then failed to keep pace through turn. HOT CHANNEL
