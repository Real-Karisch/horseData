 Footnotes
 OSHEEN pursued the loose pacesetter then made a gradual gain to get up in the late yards in time to hold off late challenge. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE settled
 outside off the leaders, bid wide into the stretch and closed well too late. SPICY CURRY came out at the start then set a clear pace but weakened in the
 final stages. LOYAL AFICIONADA dropped back inside and continued willingly while no threat. DEREYA raced wide throughout and narrowed the gap
 without menacing. REYANA REYA DELITE was fanned wide into first turn while close up and gave way.

 Footnotes
 ARK IN THE DARK, three wide early, joined for command on the turn, came in slightly through the stretch and brushed with E J'S REVENGE repeatedly
 and held on. E J'S REVENGE broke sharply, moved in and set the early pace inside, drifted out slightly through the stretch contributing to the brushing with
 ARK IN THE DARK and battled gamely to wire. CATCH FIRE saved ground early, went three wide near stretch, drifted out through stretch and made up
 some ground.. A J'S WAY, two wide early, moved out four wide near stretch, also drifted wider and had no kick. BACKSTRETCH GEORGE saved ground
 and was too late. MANTLE broke a bit awkwardly, hustled up wide to race just off the pace then stopped.

 Footnotes
 QUENCH MY THIRST dueled between foes, shook loose leaving the turn, pulled away and was fully extended until he was taken in hand in deep stretch.
 HOMEOFTHE LOMBARDI was forced out and bumped into DR BURT leaving the gate, was then bumped by that same rival soon after, joined for command
 five wide in the opening quarter, remained wide dueling for command and while unable to match strides with winner, he gamely outfinished DR BURT for
 place. DR BURT was bumped by HOMEOFTHE LOMBARDI leaving the gate and then came in and bumped that rival soon after, dueled for command four
 then three wide, raced between rivals into and through early stretch, was unable to keep up with winner and then was being eased up in the final strides and
 it may have cost him the place spot. FINN'S POSSE came out leaving the gate causing crowding, steadied on the backstretch, moved out wide and then
 faded. KING VICTORIA saved ground disputing the pace then tired. DEVILRY was forced out leaving the gate, then took up in tight soon after, was steadied
 racing along the rail into the far turn and failed to menace. BILL'S MAFIA was three wide early, took up sharply while between foes on the backstretch and
 quickly dropped back. BREATH OF ROYALTY broke slowly the was far back.

 I'M THE TALENT rushed to the front inside, widened in the stretch and remained well clear under a brisk hand ride. DIVA DRAMA chased in the two path
 and continued gamely while no match for the winner. CHARLY'S CHARM pressed the winner outside then began faltering near the quarter pole.
 POSSEINEFFECTTOO saved ground off the pace and proved empty in the stretch. LOCKETS ROCKET broke sluggishly, moved inside early, angled wide
 on turn and was no threat. HARLEY Q raced off the leaders wide and gave way. BLUE EYED CRYSTAL was urged between rivals down the backstretch
 then stopped abruptly.

 GENERAL BELLAMY was quickly in command, set the pace in three path, repulsed repeated challenges and gamely held on. SHOTMASTER, racing
 between foes, was slowly gaining. BEST CHOICE, lapped on winner, lacked a strong closing. DUNK A DIN saved ground and came up empty. NICE
 SURPRISE, in the five path and not far back, faded. BENNYLUVSPOKER stalked racing widest and then tired.

 BETHLEHEM ROAD took control inside and gradually increased his advantage under a moderate drive in a decisive victory. FIX ME A SANDWICH pressed
 the winner down the backstretch then continued gamely to the finish. KELLI'S SMILE angled three wide on the turn and finished well without menacing.
 TRAINFOURTWENTYONE saved ground off the pace and flattened out through the stretch. PNUTBUTTER SPECIAL steadied and eased back in tight in
 the opening furlong, angled inside and lacked a bid. THREETHEHARDWAY chased wide and gave way readily. AWESOME SIGHT raced wide and was
 never in contention.
