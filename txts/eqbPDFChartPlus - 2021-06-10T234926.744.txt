 Footnotes
 A NEFARIOUS CAT stalked the leaders to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out for room, responded when set down and wore down LIL'
 OLY in the final strides. The latter was on the pace from the outset, came three wide to the stretch, inched clear inside the furlong grounds, dug in gamely
 but was tagged. TAILORED trailed to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then closed willingly but too late. THRILLING RON dueled inside the runnerup
 while off the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. DUKE OF EDDIE was also stalking early then pushed up four wide on the turn to
 threaten for the lead, got outkicked in upper stretch and gave way. SECRET PRANA had no speed and was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 PRETTY SURPRISE was chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down for the drive and pushed clear late. LOVELY
 LIONESS contested the pace from the rail to the stretch, edged clear under urging to mid stretch, could not stall the winner then was tiring and just saved
 second. SANDY'S JOURNEY had no speed, raced three wide on the turn, swung out widest for the drive and closed steadily late. TWO STEPS OF GLORY
 attended the pace outside of LOVELY LIONESS to the turn, got outkicked into the stretch then lugged out in upper stretch and finished evenly. SECRET
 AGENT GIRL hustled along early to dispute the pace to the turn, was outkicked to the stretch and did not rally. RAJA'S ROSE was rank in the opening
 strides, dropped far back and lost any chance.

 INFORMANT was outrun to the turn, raced two wide to the quarter pole then swung out four wide into the stretch, rallied when set down and collared
 DESERT SMOKE late to prevail. DESERT SMOKE chased the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, responded when roused, drifted inward
 and crowded DIXIE SPICE in upper stretch, pushed to the front then could not stall the winner. MILLENNIUM BREW was also chasing to the turn, raced two
 wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then flattened out. DIXIE SPICE was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then checked off
 heels at the three sixteenths and finished evenly. D'S TWO THUMBS UP prompted the pace three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and
 weakened. ALOHA SPIRIT broke a bit slow then was sent hard to go up to the lead, set the pace two wide to the stretch then stopped.

 won driving. ALLIFORD BAY set the pace for six furlongs, responded to pressure to mid stretch then could not hold the winner while saving second. LADY

 the turn, was three wide to the stretch then responded in the drive but was outfinished. KING'S TO YOU was outrun early, raced three wide on the turn and

 Footnotes
 SWEET RIVER BAINES was outrun to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, shifted out and rallied when clear then closed determinedly to prevail. OUT
 AT EIGHT tracked the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to duel leaving mid stretch, could not stall the winner but held off the rest. TWICE AS FAST
 was chasing to the turn, saved ground and rallied up to engage for the lead, dueled past mid stretch then was outfinished. KENNY BENNY also chased the
 leader to the turn, rallied two wide to mid stretch but was outfinished late. ROB'SPEPPEREDRIDE pressed the pace off the rail to the stretch, dueled leaving
 mid stretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. RIVER OF CHAMPAGNE set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch but weakened in
 the late stages. ENDLESS MILE was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. SUNDAY NAP had no speed
 and was not a factor. ITALIAN FLING also had no speed and was outrun. HINT TO WIN never reached contention.
