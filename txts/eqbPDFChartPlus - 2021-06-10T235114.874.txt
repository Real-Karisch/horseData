 BOUNDARY BAY away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and
 into the final turn, was collared and briefly overtaken entering the stretch, but battled back determinedly through the drive to prevail. EUROPEAN away well
 and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid smartly two wide entering the final turn, took a narrow
 advantage soon after entering the stretch, but was unable to put away a stubborn BOUNDARY BAY, in a solid effort. GIMME SOME SLACK stalked the
 early pace while saving ground at the rail, while briefly in tight quarters entering the first turn, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished
 willingly three wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. ROGERIO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three out from the rail, and finished
 willingly three wide in the drive. CHILCOTIN HILL broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter two wide entering the first turn, maintained his tracking trip to the
 final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

 determinedly five wide in the drive to get up for the place. B QUICK B GONE away alertly and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing two out from

 rallied four wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious bid. KATY'S A DANCER away well and raced to

 ALLIFORD BAY tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, collared the pacesetter entering the final turn, assumed
 command leaving the turn, and quickly drew clear under intermittent urging. GOOD LUCK TO YOU away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch
 while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to prove second best.
 JAKOBS ROCKET GIRL away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run
 down the backstretch, was overtaken leaving the final turn, and had little to offer late while holding on for a share. QUATRE CAT settled off the early pace
 while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interested three wide in the drive.
 PRINCESS KATIE settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn,
 and finished willingly two wide in the drive. C U AT EAU CLAIRE broke sharply and pressed the leader two wide entering the backstretch, continued to force
 the issue to the final turn before weakening. PRINCESS O'PRADO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
