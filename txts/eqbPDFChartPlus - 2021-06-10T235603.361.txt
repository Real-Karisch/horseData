 NECKER ISLAND pressed the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch and won the nod at the wire. SILVER STATE was
 squeezed at the start, chased the pace early, made a bid three wide near the three sixteenths pole, was under a long drive and was out-nodded at the wire.
 OLLY WONDER stalked the pace early, fanned into the five path in the turn, made a bid down the lane, was three wide late but flattened out in the final
 stages. SPRAWL trailed the field early on, fanned into the five path in the turn and moved up in the stretch run. SOMETHING NATURAL was back early on,
 swung into the six path in the turn and improved position down the lane. MR HOOVER was slow at the start and never a threat. WELLS BAYOU set the
 pace early, was on the inside into the lane and gave way. STRONG TIDE fanned into the seven path entering the lane and was empty late. OFF THE
 MEDS came out at the start and was through after a half. WAYNE O stalked the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane but faded down the
 lane. BEYOND GONE was never a factor.
