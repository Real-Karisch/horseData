 Footnotes
 SHOTGUN WEDDING settled outside at the rear, advanced on the far turn coming into the stretch six wide, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch and just
 held under urging. CHAS'S LEGACY stalked the leaders three to four wide, took closer order still in that path on the far turn, gamely fought to the wire but
 just missed. BIG TALL PAUL steadied in tight between rivals entering the first turn racing just off the inside, shifted in to track along the rail up the
 backstretch, got show honors over TIZPAT, who stalked the pace two to three wide, made a mild bid leaving the far turn but evened out in the drive and was
 outfinished for third. ROMAN PLEASURE moved forward outside a rival on the first turn to set the pace, shifted in leaving that bend, gave way at the top of
 the stretch. TAMAIT (FR) broke in the air and failed to rally. DEAD ON tired inside.

 GALLANT WARRIOR got away alertly, stalked the leaders before moving four wide on the turn, drew off in the stretch and was in hand late. SPOON BOSS
 settled off the pace inside, came into upper stretch on the rail and gained second over CONQUEST SCAT CAT, who moved forward inside to prompt the
 pace, drifted out a bit at the top of the stretch, kept on to save show honors. ENDWI stalked the early leaders inside the eventual winner, moved three wide
 between on the turn, missed third. EYE OF THE HUNTER pressed the pace outside, ridden along between foes on the turn but weakened. UP TO SQUALL
 failed to rally racing well off the inside into the stretch. GOSPEL CARLO was distanced.

 Footnotes
 THREE DIAMONDS stalked the early pace three wide, drew off under urging. WICKED FACTOR pressed the pace going between foes on the turn, was no
 match for the winner but saved second from SNIPER FIRE, who shifted in to save ground on the turn, got through on the rail into the stretch, came out
 about four wide near the furlong marker and improved but just missed the place. CHASENTHISDREAM shifted in heading to the turn traveling two to three
 wide between runners on that bend, came out into the stretch and went evenly. BARBARA JO broke outwardly, bit hard hard to handle early, went four to
 five wide on the turn and had no late bid. ATLANTRA BROWN lacked early speed racing off the inside, passed foes in the stretch. SHOE GAME shifted in
 heading into the turn chasing inside the second flight and was empty in the stretch after drifting out a bit. MIDNIGHT JULIET set a pressured pace inside
 then weakened. SUSAN SNUCK IN was no factor. ROSE REFLECTION got away a bit awkwardly and in tight quarters, never threatened while racing
 outside.

 Footnotes
 TAKIN THE BLAME shifted in entering the first turn bringing up the rear, advanced inside to the far turn, steadied slightly leaving that bend then got through
 between rivals in upper stretch then cleared. CLASSY CAM set the early tempo racing inside, outpaced leaving the backstretch then switched out on the far
 turn coming to the five-sixteenths three wide, entered the stretch four wide taking a narrow lead but was no match for the winner. RUSTY ROAD caught four
 wide around the first turn and advancing on the leaders up the backstretch, contended outside on the far turn, could not go with the top two but saved show
 honors. MUGHAADIR pulled a bit in the early going entering the first turn five wide and moving to the lead early up the backstretch to force the issue, vied
 inside a rival into the far turn, needed more late. SILVER CANDY raced mostly four wide throughout and failed to rally. NOTAPRETTYPICTURE switched
 well off the inside and failed to make a bid. PRETTY IS PRETTY dropped well back off the leaders in the early going then showed mild late interest.
 POSTOR tracked briefly in behind then dropped back and tired.

 was fractious behind the gate, rated in behind the leaders two to three wide and between foes in the second flight, came out four wide to the quarter pole,

 Footnotes
 MAYS OR MANTLE saved ground on the turn racing mid-pack, switched out three wide near the furlong marker, surged past seventy yards out. RAIDER
 RED set the pace in the clear, was no match for the winner but held second. DOMS FLASH pursued the lead four to five wide and kept on in the stretch.
 HAY MAN MARK settled off the pace, advanced along the inside early on the turn, shifted six wide leaving that bend and closed willingly. E J'S GOLD was
 forwardly-placed tracking inside, had no late bid. HONSHU CITY pursued the early leader three to four wide on the turn, came out a bit leaving that bend
 and weakened. THEBIGBOMBLOOKER trailed early, saved ground and passed rivals in the stretch. GIANT PROSPECTOR chased the early pace from
 between runners then dropped back and faded. SEA MERMAN raced well outside and was no factor. HEHASSPIRIT was never a threat.
