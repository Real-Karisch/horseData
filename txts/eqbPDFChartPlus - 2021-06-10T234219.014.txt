 Footnotes
 DURLYN came in path and bumped with rival just after start then quick into stride and raced clear on top out of chute, continued to hold clear margin still
 unasked in the turn, widened advantage under left handed urging in stretch and finished clearly best. MISS MARIU made mid-race move and gained
 position near half mile marker, kept along in steady pursuit through turn and in stretch run while no match for winner. SHE'S NO JOKE was unhurried,
 hustled up through far turn then shifted widest upper stretch, continued wide bid and captured share. IS THAT MAGIC rated through early stages then
 hustled up through far turn, kept on four to five wide in stretch and got edged out for show. TIKITACA saved ground through backstretch, hustled along
 inside in turn and through stretch run but lacked needed response for late impact. AZARCH was closest pursuer of clear pacesetter through backstretch,
 hustled up three wide entering far turn, failed to advance then gave way. VALERIE FIRST raced off the pace then dropped to rail and came under a ride in
 far turn, shifted three wide with furlong left to run and failed to move into contention. PEGGITY urged along outside in the turn and failed to move on.

 Footnotes
 EMPIRE POWER cleared on top out of chute and saved ground near inside, widened advantage in the turn then hustled up turning for home, drew off on
 top then ridden out in final sixteenth. QUENANE rated in range through early stages, launched three wide bid in the turn, was no match for pulling away
 winner but continued steady effort for second best. ZIPPY stalked the leader through backstretch, came under a ride along inside in the turn, kept under
 steady urging along inside in lane and secured share. DROP KICK carried in path and brushed with rival at start, raced near inside in early stages, hustled
 up four wide late turn then lacked the needed response for late impact. PAYNTER'S BOY raced in tracking mode through early stages, launched a two wide
 bid in the turn then failed to sustain bid into stretch. GRAY BEAU settled in the back and failed to kicked on when called upon. EPIC JUNIOR broke in, raced
 in range then retreated after half.
