 Footnotes
 STORM NET assumed the early lead, set the pace near the rail and was under pressure in the drive. MATADOR saved ground around the far turn and
 rallied mildly. PROMOTE , four wide both turns, had a slight rally. ZEN'S LAND , unhurried down the backstretch, swung to the five path turning for home,
 raced outside horses and passed tired ones. MY OWN LANE saved ground the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and was not a factor.
 TUFFY'S LUCKY chased the pace two wide on the far turn and faltered in the drive. COLMONT FIRE , a forward factor three wide on both turns, faltered.
 CALL FIRST , fractious during the post parade, chased the pace for a half mile, stopped and was eased late.

 TOP HAT WARRIOR vied outside a pair of rivals while well in hand early on, emerged in a battle outside SEVILLE BARBER leaving the far turn, responded
 when shaken up left handed in upper stretch and pulled away while kept to task. SOUTHERN RULES , well placed inside and within range of the contested
 pace, angled outside a tiring rival leaving the half mile pole, circled four wide into the stretch, kept on willingly but was no match for the winner. SEVILLE
 BARBER disputed the pace between runners early, secured the inside around the turn, sparred with the winner to upper stretch then faded in the final
 furlong. APACHEAN lagged off the pace, angled out for the drive, swerved outward near the sixteenth pole and failed to menace. BIGZ LITTLER , four wide
 and under a ride leaving the half mile pole, gave way. OY TO THE WORLD vied inside for three and a half furlong then faltered.

 SMILE FOR ETERNITY tracked inside while under confident rating, awaited room nearing the lane, moved through an inviting seam along the rail in upper
 stretch, dueled, shook clear after being shaken up inside the three sixteenths, drifted a bit late and was all out to hold off ISOLATED. ISOLATED stalked
 outside a rival, eased out and ranged up four wide into the lane to challenge, kept on doggedly after the winner cleared and came back gamely to just miss.
 LOVE YOU MUCH rated off the early pace, came under pressure mid turn, edged up behind rivals near mid stretch, chased between foes past the sixteenth
 marker and needed more. RUNAWAY BULL , four wide, advanced under a hustling ride past the three eighths, angled a bit wider for the drive and flattened
 out. THUNDER'S HONOR settled off the pace, came four wide for the drive and lacked a solid kick. BURFORD broke a step slow, settled off the pace,
 angled wide and lacked a bid. YOU CAN NEVER TELL prompted the pace outside the leader, bid three wide into the lane, vied between rivals leaving the
 quarter pole then faded in the final furlong. NAUTICAL NATURE sprinted clear early, raced two wide with outside pressure into the lane, stayed on to the
 three sixteenths then weakened. LACROSTIX saved ground, steadied nearing the three eighths and weakened.

 Footnotes
 VIA CASTAGNA, bumped by SECOND ENCORE leaving the starting gate, quickly was taken to the inner rail, saved ground around the turn, eased out
 turning for home, altered course to the four path approaching the eighth pole, closed outside PETION NIGHT and was along in time. PETION NIGHT
 bumped with ANY DARN DAY leaving the starting, moved up four deep to take the lead leaving the turn and gave way grudgingly in the drive.
 CANDLESTICK NIC chased the pace three wide around the turn and failed to menace late in an even effort. THE CONSTABLE showed speed along the
 inner rail and weakened the final furlong. ANY DARN DAY bumped with PETION NIGHT leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide and failed to
 rally. PHANTOM SPOT lacked speed and passed tired rivals. WISE STORY , five deep around the turn, was not a factor. BROOKLYN SARDY prompted
 the pace two wide around the turn and gave way. CARPENTER was outrun. SECOND ENCORE bumped the winner leaving the starting gate, dropped back
 on the turn and was eased through the stretch.

 Footnotes
 OLYMPIC VILLAGE edged up nearing the half mile marker while saving ground, patiently stalked a contested pace mid turn, angled five wide entering the
 lane, shifted in a bit advancing past the three sixteenths, leveled off when switching to his correct lead soon after, surged to command approaching the
 sixteenth pole and drew clear under steady handling. SMILE BRYAN broke a step slow, recovered and showed a nice burst of speed inside rivals and
 cleared leaving the chute, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure mid turn, shook back clear entering the stretch, dug in when confronted in mid stretch
 and stayed on well. CANDY STORE saved ground off the pace, angled six wide gathering steam into the stretch, straightened and continued with interest.
 V. I. P. TICKET stalked the pace off the rail, bid three deep and under a ride mid turn, forced the issue into the lane and faded. INTO TEMPTATION , away
 alertly, prompted the pace outside SMILE BRYAN, moved to apply more pressure past the three eighths, vied under a hearty ride while between rivals past
 the five sixteenths, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and gave way. NOONSIGHT bore out at the break, raced four wide under some early rating,
 angled in and faded.

 Footnotes
 NO MO LADY , patiently handled down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch, split rivals approaching
 the eighth pole, closed determinedly outside JENNIFER'S DREAM and was up in time. JENNIFER'S DREAM circled the turn, gained a four wide lead
 entering the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. COOGEE BEACH, pinched back leaving the starting gate, was two wide on the
 turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. COLLOQUIUM bore out leaving the starting gate, showed speed along the rail and weakened
 in the stretch. SWEET HOME DIXIE lacked speed, was three wide on the turn, angled to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. BETTER
 YET stumbled leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn and lacked a rally. GARDENISTA , five wide turning for home, gave way. MY
 WYNTER ROSE , outrun, saved ground on the turn then drifted wide in upper stretch. SLIDE A BIT dueled three wide to the stretch then faltered.

 Footnotes
 WATCHIN THE WHEELS stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, secured command in upper stretch and
 drew out under pressure. STORM RAVEN saved ground stalking the pace, angled to the two path turning for home, split foes late and passed tired ones.
 THAT'STHEWAYTODOIT chased the pace two wide and weakened. JABUTICABA set the pace near the rail, raced greenly in the drive and weakened.
 LUBRICUS SOROR , shuffled back soon after the break, hugged the rail far turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to rally. FULL OF DRAMA raced in
 mid pack well off the rail and lacked a rally. MISS QUICK , four wide both turns, had a mild advance to the stretch then faded. SAY YES DI DI was outrun
 after being pinched back leaving the starting gate. BOOM BOOM GONE , three wide the first turn, was not a factor. FOUND A PRINCESS , steadied in
 close quarters approaching the first turn, raced three wide around the first turn and dropped back on the far turn. CHULITA dropped back on the far turn.
 COLD HEARTED CAT trailed.
