 Footnotes
 DIVISION ONE ducked out while breaking sharply then was rank when taken under rating, moved two wide to command before a half and drew out under
 urging. LAST WOODMAN broke in the air, was unhurried early, raced two wide around the turn and lacked a rally. CRAZY IDEA broke slowly, lagged to the
 stretch then made a belated run inside. OWIN I AM was very wide into the stretch and gained mildly. DYNA'S REFLECTION was fractious in the gate and
 had to be reloaded, raced three wide around the turn and tired. WELLER made the pace along the rail for about a half then stopped.

 Footnotes
 STEEL BAY advanced the rail on the backstretch, came out into TIZA WEIGELIA entering the turn, came out for the drive, was carried out and ran clear
 late. SCARFREE showed speed from the outside, edged clear before going a quarter, angled to the rail on the turn then drifted through the lane and
 faltered. PLUS PERFECT reared in the gate at the break, steadied to avoid heels while trying to rally the rail around the turn, came out between rivals for
 the drive and finished fast. GIRLS AND GUNS jumped a shadow midway on the turn, bore out into TIZA WEIGELIA, stayed inside into the stretch and
 finished fast. SOBEIT SYLVIA was slow early, steadied through traffic along the rail around the turn and finished willingly. JUSTGIMMEAKISS was forced
 wide on the turn and lacked a strong closing. WOLFIE steadied two wide between rivals midway on the turn and continued evenly. FOXY HEROINE was
 wide and no factor. FRENCH ROMANCE wasn't far back between rivals early, was bumped three wide midway on the turn and stopped. MOON CHANT
 was forced very wide on the turn and stopped. TIZA WEIGELIA was fractious in the gate, was bumped entering the turn then was bumped into FRENCH
 ROMANCE and taken up between rivals midway on the turn when GIRLS AND GUNS bore out then stopped. There was a stewards's inquiry but the results
 stood.
