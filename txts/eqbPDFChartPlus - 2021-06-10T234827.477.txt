 Footnotes
 PASSION FOR PAPA went up inside to duel for the lead, inched away leaving the turn and drew off in the stretch under urging. MADERA JUBILEE wide
 early, chased off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and was clearly second best. LEA'S REWARD dueled between horses then stalked a bit off the
 rail into the turn, angled to the inside on the turn and bested the others. PATIENCE LADY had speed between horses then stalked off the rail leaving the
 backstretch and outside a rival on the turn, continued between foes into the stretch and weakened. PRECIOUS CAROLINE broke in the air then hopped,
 threw her head and was away behind the field as the rider briefly lost the irons, saved ground well back and was not a threat. SILVER OAK a bit slow to
 begin, settled off the rail, angled in some on the turn and had little left for the stretch. YES VIRGINIA had speed off the rail then dueled between horses then
 three deep, battled outside the winner early on the turn, stalked leaving the turn and into the stretch, was being pulled up in the final furlong, was unsaddled
 just past the wire and walked off.

 KENDA sped between horses to the early lead, set the pace inside, responded when headed crossing the dirt and into the stretch, fought back to the front in
 midstretch, inched clear in deep stretch and held on gamely under some urging. MADAM DANCEALOT (IRE) stalked the pace inside, came out into the
 stretch and finished willingly. STORM THE HILL stalked outside then off the rail, angled to the inside after the right hand curve, came out leaving the hill and
 bid three deep to gain the advantage on the dirt crossing, battled outside the winner in midstretch, could not match that one in deep stretch and lost second
 late. CYNTHIANA dropped back inside early, saved ground off the pace, came out leaving the hill and three deep into the stretch and lacked the needed
 rally. SABURAI stalked the pace outside a rival, bid between horses leaving the hill, continued a bit off the rail into the stretch and weakened. Rail on hill at

 REIKI BABY saved ground chasing the pace, came out in upper stretch and rallied under urging to get up in the final stride. CLASSY TUNE had good early
 speed and dueled outside a rival, inched away a half mile out, angled in on the turn, kicked clear and held on well but was caught on the line. TIZ MY LOVE
 stalked a bit off the rail then between foes a half mile out, angled to the inside on the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and bested the others.
 PRECIOUS DIXIE between foes early, stalked off the rail, came out some in the stretch and weakened. FORTUNATE QUEEN stalked outside then four
 wide a half mile out, continued outside a rival on the turn and four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. RAMONA LOVER pressed the pace
 inside then stalked a bit off the rail, was between foes into the stretch and gave way. TIZ BAILEE settled off the rail, angled to the inside in the stretch and
 lacked a further response. TIZ THE LIGHT stalked between horses then outside a rival on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and gave way.

 stalking the pace, came out leaving the turn and into the stretch and finished willingly between foes. BROOKES ALL MINE stalked between rivals then
 outside a foe, came out into the stretch and also went on willingly between horses late. LOB CITY pulled along the inside and steadied into the first turn,
 stalked along the rail, continued inside into the stretch, came out some for room and also went between rivals in deep stretch but was outfinished. STOLE
 MY 'ART pressed the pace inside then stalked early on the backstretch, bid again along the rail a half mile out, put a head in front on the second turn, fought
 back inside in the stretch and weakened some late. DISSENSION bobbled at the start, settled off the rail then outside a rival, went three deep leaving the
 second turn and four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. LIRICA HEAT (ARG) chased a bit off the rail then outside a rival, was briefly in a

 MIRACLE MARCH dueled outside a rival, inched away into the stretch and drew clear under some urging and energetic handling. DESERT LAW chased off
 the rail then outside on the turn and three wide into the stretch and just got the place. WATERED DOWN stalked just off the rail then between foes into the
 turn, continued off the inside leaving the turn, came out in the stretch and just lost second. CAYATE bobbled then steadied at the start, pulled between
 horses then stalked a bit off the rail, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. LOVELY ANZI went up inside to duel for the lead, fought back on
 the turn and weakened in the stretch. BRICKHOUSE settled outside then off the rail, came out four wide into the stretch and did not rally. SPIRITUAL
 WARRIOR stalked three deep between horses, was in a bit tight into the turn, angled to the inside into the stretch and weakened. E BRADLEY COOPER
 stalked four wide, dropped back between horses on the turn, also angled to the inside into the stretch and gave way.

 Footnotes
 CORPS DE BALLET four wide into the first turn, stalked outside then three deep into and on the second turn, went four wide a quarter mile out, bid three
 deep into the stretch, gained the lead nearing midstretch and held on gamely under left handed urging. MADAME STRIPES (ARG) three deep early, stalked
 between foes then a bit off the rail, waited in traffic leaving the second turn, came out into the stretch and finished willingly to just miss. AMBOSELI a bit
 slow into stride, settled outside a rival, came out five wide into the stretch and rallied to edge a rival late for the show. SKRADIN (ARG) stalked the pace
 inside, awaited room off heels on the second turn, came out into the stretch, bid between foes in midstretch and was edged for third. NODIAC (IRE) saved
 ground chasing the pace, came out a bit in the stretch, waited off heels in midstretch, split horses past midstretch and was outfinished. EILEEN'S GIRL
 settled outside a rival, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch and also was outfinished. DYNAMIC MIZZES K saved ground
 chasing the pace, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch and could not quite summon the necessary late kick. MANGITA angled in
 and stalked between foes, bid between rivals on the second turn and outside a rival leaving that turn, took a short lead into the stretch, fought back between
 foes in midstretch and weakened late. THERMODYNAMICS a bit slow to begin, saved ground off the pace to the stretch and lacked the needed rally.
 BERT'S MELODY sped to the early lead, set the pace inside, dueled on the second turn and into the stretch, continued inside in midstretch and weakened.
 TICABOO was rank early and stalked three deep, bid three wide into the second turn, fell back some leaving that turn and three wide into the stretch and
 had little left for the drive.
