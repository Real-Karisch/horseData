 Footnotes
 BIG CLUE settled nicely being rated along inside, steadily advanced into closer contention then guided out to clear path late turn, took over lead from
 NONNO NINO and dropped whip but proved to be of no factor, finished clear. NONNO NINO stalked along inside then made bid and took over lead near
 quarter pole, briefly held on top then outkicked by winner. ANGELINO reserved running through backstretch, roused four to five wide in far turn and finished
 up well. ERRE ERRE raced off the pace, saved ground then waited for room near quarter pole, angled out then finished evenly. SCHWEETS raced near the
 back, gained position racing five wide in final turn then failed to sustain upper stretch. CIRCLE AWAY raced off the pace, hustled up five wide upper stretch
 without threatening. IRISH LETTERS rated off the pace then raced in tight at quarter pole, got clear but failed to gain. THE STIFLER cleared on top after
 start and set the pace racing along rail, continued clear through middle stages then collared at quarter pole and faded. OMENED BY settled nicely racing in
 range, under a ride in far turn, failed to move on then dropped back. IL BIONDO raced off second flight going by half mile marker, cut the corner then and
 put to drive on rail, failed to move on. MOON LOVER swerved at start and failed to make bid. SALUTE AND SERVE stalked the leader then hustled up for
 more, checked back at quarter pole and quickly retreated.

 Footnotes
 NOBLE DRAMA was well positioned being rated four to five paths off inside racing just out of striking distance, began to edge up to leaders mid-way
 through turn then under strong ride at the quarter pole failing to reach top pair, left handed and out wider out of the turn, refused to give up and continued
 charge toward MO CASH, reached game rival deep stretch and drove by in time. MO CASH reined back to rate off early speed out of the chute, in bit tight
 between rivals going by five furlong marker, made move three wide near three eighths pole, edged up to take slight edge over WEISSER then rival battled
 back turning for home, dueled with head in front then got by rival but faced with charging NOBLE DRAMA, fought back with strong effort then got nailed in
 final strides, game try. MR. JORDAN stalked up close along rail, wait for racing room at half mile marker and continued without clear racing room mid-turn,
 hustled up two wide at quarter pole, moved out wider and finished with response clearing show. WEISSER bumped bit at start then moved up inside past
 five eighths pole and took over lead, set pressured pace with DUNK sitting on flank, dueled with MO CASH when rival kicked up mid-turn, headed for the
 lead then battled back turning for home, dug in gamely trying hard to move on, had no kick left in final sixteenth. FRONT LOADED tracked up close three
 path, lost position in turn then came out wider three sixteenths pole and failed to kick on in lane. DUNK restless in the gate then led the way out of chute,
 lost lead to WEISSER and applied pace pressure to rival, could not hold position mid-turn and steadily weakened.

 ZENDEN broke in and bumped repeatedly start, hustled up in close contention at quarter pole, roused into stretch then drifted out at eighth pole briefly but
 quickly corrected and finished clear. JAMAICAN set pressured pace then edged away to length on top out of the turn, continued dig in but could not hold off
 challenge of winner in final sixteenth. RETURNTHESTAR pinballed repeatedly step after start and trailed the field, driving three wide in stretch and
 produced good effort to get up for share. COUNTRY SINGER applied pace pressure to JAMAICAN through early stages, vied in the turn but could not reach
 equal terms with rival, lost ground on lead but kept on with good response upper stretch then gaveway late and lost show. ARRIVEDERLA raced up close
 just in backstretch, continued chase in close contention into turn then weakened turning for home and kept on evenly. MR. EDGAR under steady urging
 near inside, cut corner and roused along rail bit failed to kick on. CONNOLLY STATION bumped repeatedly at start, dropped back and never recovered.
