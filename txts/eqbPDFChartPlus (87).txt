 CHIEF CICATRIZ prompted the issue along the inside, reached the front entering the lane and drew clear then was hand urged while maintaining a safe
 margin. OIL MONEY set a pressured pace just outside the top one then kept on willingly through the stretch run. FORTIFIED EFFORT raced in the six path
 into the lane and offered a gradual stretch gain. LIBERTARIAN bobbled at the start and trailed, raced near the rail turning for home and offered a mild
 response. IT MAKES SENSE forwardly placed early, raced five wide into the lane and weakened.

 handed urging. EYE OF THE HUNTER vied along the rail early, fell back and saved ground to the turn, went six wide entering the stretch, closed well to get
 up for place and was no match for the winner. RONTON was unhurried early, raced outside, bid five wide to get within striking distance and came up empty
 late. WILD ATLANTIC WAY vied inside to the second turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. UTANDREAM vied three across to the second turn,
 tired and gave way. BATTLE ZONE vied between horses, tired into the turn and stopped.

 Footnotes
 NUDIAMOND was squeezed along the rail and checked hard entering the first turn, pressed the pace three across to the second turn, challenged for the
 lead, drew away for a clear lead in the upper stretch and held off the late charge of CHRISTINE'S JACK. CHRISTINE'S JACK was unhurried early, saved
 ground, bid inside, altered course late and surged to just miss at the wire. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM bumped at the start, set the pace to the second turn,
 fell back and finished evenly. SPITTIN HAVOC was fractious in the paddock, bumped at the start, stalked inside and lacked the needed late rally. BRAVE
 HELIOS pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the far turn, weakened in the drive and faded from contention. MAGIC BRO bumped and was
 crowded at the start, was never far off the pace and lacked the needed stretch response. I'M AMORE bumped at the start and was outrun in an even effort.
 SINK THE BISMARCK broke out and bumped at the start, was eased and walked off. The quarter mile fractional split was hand timed. PER RULING
 #19-20TP103 FROM THE ARIZONA RACING COMMISSION, NUDIAMOND WAS DQ'D DUE TO POSITIVE TEST.
