 NICO'S PRIZE sprinted to the front and held it comfortably, drew off as the race went on and was briefly asked for run at the eighth pole but otherwise was
 in hand the whole way. DUKIN' WITH DALE chased the pace on the outside going three wide around the turn then was overwhelmed by the winner. JUST

 Footnotes
 SALEM LOOP sat well rated off the pace while saving ground most of the way, was full of run at the quarter pole and turned for home going three wide and
 slowly drew off from there. CHASE LANE stalked the pace on the inside, had no room to run at the three eighths pole but eventually got through at the
 quarter pole and ran gamely from there. NICK'S POSSE hit the gate and was slow into stride at the start then trailed the field but stayed on the inside, was
 full of run at the quarter pole going four wide into the stretch then flattened out. HECTIC chased the pace going two wide around the turn then weakened.
 UCCELLO BELLO tracked the pace going two wide around the turns but had no rally. PUT IT FORWARD was reluctant to load but broke well and was
 hustled to the front, stayed up there comfortably until the top of the stretch where he came up empty.
