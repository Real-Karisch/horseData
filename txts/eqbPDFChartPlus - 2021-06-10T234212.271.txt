 BIXIE dueled for the lead while two wide, was in a long sustained drive and was all out in the end to hold sway in a game effort. FOUETTEE was well placed
 while racing three wide into the turn, was in a long drive and dug in gamely but was outfinished in late stretch. RAPID LADY chased the early pace while two
 wide, was blocked behind the leaders in upper stretch, angled out to be four wide in just inside the furlong marker then finished strong but was too late.
 BLINGONTHWING was unruly in the post parade tossing her jockey, was sent up in a duel from the inside into the turn, was in a long drive and gamely dug
 in but hung in late stretch. DEE AND ELLE raced four wide on the turn and failed to menace. COLONIAL KENDRA was no factor.
 IGOTYURGRASSHOPPER was unhurried early and no threat. YES IM SERIOUS was no factor.
