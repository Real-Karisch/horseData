 Footnotes
 SHE'SCREATIVE close from the start, challenged the leader from the outside in the turn, gained the advantage into the stretch and steadily drew out while
 under pressure. SARAH'S PRAYER within striking distance while racing outside, fell back a bit exiting the turn, set down for the drive, up late for the place,
 no threat to the winner. SUCKERFORAGREY away in good order, set the early pace inside, dueled early turn, headed by late in the bend, chased the
 winner past the furlong marker, drifted out under a repeated left handed whip late causing LOVE ICE to check up sharply, nipped at the wire by the runner
 up. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, SUCKERFORAGREY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH.
 LOVE ICE brushed at the start, raced back, was staging a rally through traffic when forced to check up when SUCKERFORAGREY drifted out in deep
 stretch to lose momentum. YES GORGEOUS forwardly placed while racing off the inside, narrowly closest to the winner in midstretch, was weakening when
 bothered late, continued to tire in the final strides. RUN BY off slowly, made little impact. CALL ME SIDNEY finished early, well back.

 Footnotes
 ITS MR SLEW TO YOU moved closer in the first turn on the outside to prompt the pace, took over before a half, clear late backstretch, allowed the runner
 up the inside entering the stretch, responded when called upon, long drive, proved best in a determined effort. PASSING SIMON forwardly placed along the
 inside, advanced and challenged inside the winner entering the stretch, dueled to the wire, outkicked. KIRA'S KING settled back off the pace in the two path,
 floated out a bit with a half mile remaining, set down for the drive, closest to the top two a furlong out, no match for that pair, lasted for the show. TOO
 MUCH SAUCE void of early foot, asked along into the stretch, steered out widest nearing the furlong marker, finished willingly to be gaining for the show.
 SILVER ROCKET MAN lacked speed, five wide turning for home, improved position while remaining out in the strip. ADIEU GERALD one paced while off
 the inside, four wide turning into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. FIRST BULL RUN failed to menace. CAPTAIN BERTI dueled early off the inside,
 continued to be a forward factor the middle half, gave way.

 Footnotes
 WHISTLING RANGER away in good order, raced off the pace outside, pulled early, confidently handled the middle half, took over turning for home, and
 drew off as he pleased under token encouragement. COLT'S SECRET raced in the main pack while saving ground, continued to race along the inside
 second turn, moved out nearing the furlong grounds, up late for the place, no match for the winner. JAX'S BOY void of early foot, moved outside early,
 swung out five wide exiting the final turn, finished willingly while not having enough late for the place. HAVE HEART CAN RUN away with the leaders,
 narrowly showed the way first turn, clear at the midway point, began to weaken when headed by the winner entering the stretch, still closest to that one past
 the furlong marker, caught for the place late. CAMPUS LEADER went one paced off the inside in lacking a late kick. CLASIFRONTIER forwardly placed off
 the inside, challenged between rivals in the second turn then faltered in the drive. ONE WAY off a step slow, lagged far back, picked off some tiring rivals
 while never a threat. COAST GUARD KID also broke slowly, had little for the drive. LOVE LIST off slowly as well, remained always back. GOING PLACES
 dueled early off the inside, stopped after a half, far back, jogged under wire.

 Footnotes
 FREAKONTHELEAD took command soon after the start inside, showed the way through the turn while continuing along the rail, turned back a foe a furlong
 out to be edging clear late. CARMENS CATCHER prompted the issue from the outside, four wide through the turn, tried the winner a furlong out but was not
 good enough, remained clear of the others. JUST DUE moved up early off the inside to press the issue between foes, could not keep up with the top two in
 the drive, comfortably clear of the others. CHRISTOPHER CAT forced the issue three wide and between horses for a half then weakened in the drive. MICK
 last to leave, was never dangerous. MATOU was finished early.

 Footnotes
 PEERAGE narrowly showed the way out of the chute, vied up front closest to the inside up the backstretch, dueled through the turn and into the lane, long
 drive, proved best in determined fashion. LAHAINA LAD broke alertly, alternated up front off the inside, continued to race on equal terms with the winner
 into and through the stretch, outkicked in the late going, held sway for the place. SUCCESSFUL RYKER in the second flight, asked along three wide turning
 for home, slowly closing the gap on the top two late. BANK ON JON back off the pace and the inside, roused four wide exiting the turn, staged a mild rally
 while well out in the strip. V DOUBLE U last away, raced back, fanned six wide into the stretch, improved a bit past the furlong marker then was flat late.
 INDIO ATLANTICO back off the pace, came five wide into the stretch, lacked a late kick. DIXIELAND NATIVE settled in mid pack early off the inside, lacked
 a response in the drive. GOTTHEMUSICINME forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat before a half.

 INDY AWESOME allowed the leader to go early, pursued that one up the backstretch and through the second turn, called on for some run entering the
 stretch, collared that rival inside the furlong marker and won going away. RED PRODUCTION broke sharp, sprinted well clear through the first turn,
 continued to show the way the middle half while attempting to rate, continued to hold a sizable advantage upper stretch, proved no match late, clearly
 second best. MESETA DIABLO last to leave, advanced after a half, proved no match for the top two in the drive, clear of the others. BEN'S MAGIC STONE
 went one paced throughout in lacking a response in the drive. COLLIN'S MYSTERY in the second flight in pursuit of the runner up inside the winner for over
 a half, gave way. MR. SHAD was through early, well beaten.

 RUSH TO JUDGMENT took control soon after the start, set a relaxed pace under restraint, continued to show the way into the lane along the inside and had
 enough left in the late going. BETTY GRABLE EYES outrun for five furlongs off the inside, began to move midway on the far turn, came four wide into the
 stretch, lugged in a bit when straightened for home then finished well to be getting to the winner later. AWESOME DIAMOND devoid of early foot, remained
 back while inside of traffic late in the final turn, steered out widest for the drive, also closed some ground late to be clear of the rest. PROVOKING CAT back
 off the pace, raced in some traffic out of the final turn, improved position slightly with some modest late interest. SWAMPED back off the issue in the first
 turn, made an early move into contention the second quarter, chased winner past the furlong marker and weakened in the late going. WONDER BOYS
 DREAM went one paced throughout inn lacking a late bid. LATE APPOINTMENT closest to the winner for much of the way, gave way in the drive.
 EXPRESS YOURSELF broke well, raced forwardly and outside, began to fade in the second turn. BACK STAGE BONITA remained always back.
 ROBERT'S BEAUTY off slow, bothered, raced wide and backed up in the drive.

 Footnotes
 WABASH CANNONBALL behind horses off the inside, avoided a stricken foe late in the turn, steered out a bid for the drive, set down and finished with
 good resolve to b e in time. MASSTER CHIEF RON forwardly placed outside, moved closer four wide turning into the lane, challenged past the furlong
 marker, led late, could not contain the winner. SLIDERULER off the pace inside, slight steady inside of a stricken rival a quarter mile out, roused in the two
 path exiting the turn, moved out a bit, finished with some interest to gain the nod for the show at the wire. TOP CAT'S BEST BET with the pace while
 between rivals for a half, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, weakened in the late going, lost the nod for the show. TIZ AMERICA set or forced the
 pace along the inside, faltered in the drive. PUREST PLEASURE last to leave, fell further back when sluggish, was well back when forced to alter course
 around a stricken foe late in the turn, remained back. HALF OUR CLASS broke sharply, contested the issue three wide, pulled up suddenly in distress late
 in the turn, vanned off.

 Footnotes
 AMEROCKO never far back, advanced and challenged three wide through the turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane, dug in late while closest to the
 inside of the first three and narrowly prevailed. RISKY FOREST unhurried early, in the second flight through the turn in the four path, late bid on the outside,
 missed. RIVER PRIDE within striking distance off the inside, three wide turn when moving closer, late bid between the top two, missed. MASCULINO
 moved up to set the early pace, continued to vie along the rail through the turn, weakened in the final furlong. HERO'S DIVIDE forwardly placed just off the
 inside, came up empty for the stretch run while remaining in the two path. DIXIE BEAT forwardly placed early, shuffled back in some traffic early in the turn,
 went evenly in the drive when clear. LIKE A DEPUTY lacked speed, five wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. ZARBY'S DERBY DAY
 remained always back. BADTOTHEBONEBLAKE fell back to trail after the start and showed little.
