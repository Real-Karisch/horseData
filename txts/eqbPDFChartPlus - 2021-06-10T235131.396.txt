 Footnotes
 GOLD EKATI always within striking distance, drew on even terms in the five path nearing the quarter pole, dueled the length of the stretch exchanging
 bumps with the runner up and proved best under brisk handling. PACIFIC IMAGE prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, drifted out a bit
 entering the stretch bumping with the winner, battled to the wire and just missed in a game effort. MASQUERADE PARTY broke in front, stalked the pace
 and went evenly. TEAM SIX made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the turn then gradually weakened. CHARITABLE failed to menace.
 INVOCATION was no factor. GRADY was no threat. PYRITE GREEN was outrun. SAN GENNARO was through early.

 Footnotes
 DAWSON'S FLIGHT prompted the pace in the four path for a half, made the lead, shook clear on the far turn, set the balance of the pace while getting slow
 fractions and lasted under strong handling. SEAS COURAGE broke in front set the pace for nearly a half, chased the winner the balance of the trip and just
 held on for second. FUSION trailed inside into the far turn, remained along the rail into the stretch, drifted out to the ten path under left handed urging and
 was steadily gaining ground late. ABOUT NATIONAL moved up entering the far turn then was outfinished. NOTHINGBUTNONSENSE was no factor. SIR
 STEVIEBOY was no threat. ROLLIN INSIDE OUT was forced out at the start then hung outside into the first turn, remained outside while within striking
 distance for six furlongs then faltered. HEIDI'S SINATRA close up for a half stopped. UNBRIDLED SILK bore out at the start, was through early and
 stopped.

 Footnotes
 WHOLE LOTTA RUN shifted out to the six path before a half, rallied to make the lead nearing the quarter pole then finished full of run to win as much the
 best while taken in hand late. CARAMELO pressed the pace for the opening quarter two wide, made the lead, set the pace to the quarter pole then was no
 match for the winner. SHOOTOUT never far back, advanced steadily while shifting out to the five path entering the stretch and finished determinedly. ARAB
 SPRING found his best stride late in the six path. NEEDMORE CASH drifted in at the start, offered a mild bid on the far turn then was outfinished. MY
 FRIEND KEITH was no threat. NEUK was bumped at the start, sprinted to the lead along the inside, set pace for nearly a half, had speed for six furlongs
 then gave way. PEPPERMINT PRINCE was squeezed at the start, rushed to contention three wide soon thereafter, had speed for a half then stopped.
 CHICHARITO stumbled into NEUK at the start and stopped after a half.

 Footnotes
 INTELLIGENT FLASH battled for the early lead two wide, drew clear before the turn then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best. ROCK
 NATION chased the pace and finished second best in the six path. WARLANDER unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the four path. LEGAL DISPUTE
 bore in at the start hitting the temporary rail, reared up, trailed into the turn, swung wide then closed willingly in the middle of the racetrack. DESIGNER WIN
 passed tiring rivals. DOMESTIC CAT was no threat. CAIMAN CONQUERED close inside to the stretch, faded. STEADY HEAT offered a mild bid in the four
 path on the turn then came up empty. RUN KID RUN was bumped at the start then failed to menace. DISCIPLINARYACTION was no factor. MAHALO
 MALAKI bore in at the start bumping RUN KID RUN, had speed into the stretch, swung wide and dropped out of it. KID ORY dueled for the early lead along
 the inside then stopped.
