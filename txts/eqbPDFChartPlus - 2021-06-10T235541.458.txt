 Footnotes
 ELIZABETH NICOLE put to some light hand urging after springing from the starting gate, emerged from a tight early pack with the advantage, was moved to
 the inside route, showed the way, still under some light hand encouragement, on a loosely-contested lead, steadily kicked away from the competition during
 the run around the bend, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths maker before finally gettling called upon for more, gave the desired response and padded
 the margin, then saw the pilot revert to light urging during the final seventy yards with the outcome no longer in doubt. MOONDANCE JOY saved ground to
 the quarter pole, spun three wide into the lane and went on to finish a non-threatening second. SOXY RUBY stalked the winner from path two, firmly rated
 during the initial stages, gave way. PREZIOSA two wide and asked for run on the turn, never made its presence felt. OLA GATITA three wide onto the turn,
 was sent one path farther off the rail into the stretch, trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 SURFACE STRIKE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under
 challenge from BIG ENGINE a furlong out, rebuffed that rival inching away briefly before coming under threat from the runner up and held safe at the finish
 to prevail. DARK MONEY four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to close in
 and threaten late but was ultimately repelled to the finish. BIG ENGINE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three
 wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, got rebuffed by the top one and weakened in the late stages while salvaging the show
 honors. PRETERNATURAL coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch, weakened in
 the late going. REMSTIN three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, made no headway. D
 EMCEE chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch and
 made no impact. OUR AMERICAN STAR chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for
 home and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 DUNBAR ROAD went about the backstretch under a brisk hand ride, stepped onto the the turn from the three path, crept up to the front runners, joining
 them by midpoint, got set down coming into the lane, took charge in short order and kicked well clear. SOUTH OF THE SHORE reserved in the two path for
 over three-quarters, saw much of the journey on the turn with her and CAP DE CREUS leaning upon each other, swung four wide into the lane, rallied well
 enough to secure second. PRIVATE BEACH grabbed command shortly the field had been sent on its way, raced heads apart with NO HAYNE NO GAYNE,
 spotted at a slight distance from off the rail, had the winner make its presence felt at the three-eighths pole, was being challenged in earnest by that
 opponent when turned loose herself in upper stretch, bumped with an errant CAP DE CREUS in the vicinity of three-sixteenths marker, lost contact with the
 winner then weakened into the show slot. CAP DE CREUS was along the inside route tracking the front runners, pulling on the left due to pressure being
 applied on that side, slid onto the left rim of the inside route after departing the backstretch, continued on it, going shoulder to shoulder at times with SOUTH
 OF THE SHORE, to the outside, got out and continued to venture to the outside when put to some urging spinning into the stretch, made solid contact with
 PRIVATE BEACH soon afterwards, fell back steadily after never regaining any real interest. NO HAYNE NO GAYNE pressed the issue towards path two,
 was through after going three-quarters, then was allowed to fade away down the lane, coaxed along.

 MY ITALIAN RABBI hustled from the gate, crossed to the two path at the nine-sixteenths forcing REWARDED to be steadied off her heels, pressed the
 pace of LOVE ME TOMORROW from the outside between foes through the turn lightly coaxed along, swung three wide into upper stretch, got roused
 straightened away, took over command a furlong out and edged away to the finish kept to task. PRINCESS COREY coaxed from the gate, crossed over to
 prompt the top pair from the outside three wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase
 the winner home and safely secure the place honors. LOVE ME TOMORROW hustled from the gate to the front immediately, showed the way through swift
 splits along the inside lightly coaxed along under pressure from a pair, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was displaced
 from the front a furlong from home, weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest for the show honors. REWARDED coaxed from the gate, got
 steadied off the heels of MY ITALIAN RABBI as that rival crossed in front at the nine-sixteenths, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
 three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered no response. LAUNCH SEQUENCE chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
 six to seven wide into upper stretch, tired. DOTDOTDASH four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch
 and tired. TOTE BOARD broke in at the start and was corrected, strode greenly just off the inside stargazing into and through the midway point on the turn,
 came under a protective hold into upper stretch and was eased home through to the finish, then walked off under ger own power.

 Footnotes
 SEANOW corrected after breaking to the outside, motored his way to the front end, went over to the inside, got rated showing the way on a
 loosely-contested lead throwing down fraction after fraction, settled in at the three-sixteentsh marker and was let out, kept on going with good energy to hold
 sway. COLLINS AVE along the outside, sat reserved in the two path during the opening phases, flashed interest getitng tipped into the four path as six
 furlongs was being completed, stepped into the stretch, went on to best HONORABLE HERO for place honors. HONORABLE HERO stalked the winner
 from the two path, in the general area of that opponent but without ever having hitched up, was set down for the drive home, failed to dent into the deficit,
 then went on to be out-dueled by COLLINS AVE for second. FALSE INFO remained along the inside route after the start, was sighted fighting against the bit
 for a good portion of the trip leading up to midpoint on the backstretch, was called upon approaching the quarter pole, got outfinished. CORAL LEGACY
 reserved in the two path during the initial stages, was three wide in pursuit of the front runners on the second bend, got worked in path four from upper to
 midstretch, made no headway. THOMOND PARK was moved over to the rail after hesitating at the break, took it until a short distance from the quarter pole,
 angled five wide for racing clearance during the initial portion of the stretch, had no gain. GO POKE THE BEAR cut over to the inside after the start,
 remained on it biding time, was steadied after coming up to the some traffic during the final stages of the run around the far turn,wandered out six wide in
 stages down the stretch to no avail.

 at the five-sixteenths and advanced into contention swinging four wide for home, dug in under a drive to issue a challenge through the length of the stretch
 knocking heads and taking narrow command sixteenth out, then gamely fended off her main rival to prevail at the end. HONEY GRAEME coaxed from the
 gate, prompted the leader three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch loosely between foes, took
 over straightened away, dug in confronted by the aforementioned foe, dueled through to the finish getting headed a sixteenth out and fought on to the wire
 but was ultimately bested at the finish. CLAIRVOYANT LADY broke out at the start bumping TIMELY TRADITION lightly into HONEY GRAEME, chased

 SAFTA engaged three wide with TRIUMPHANT on the backstrtch, moved over to the inside once that rival called it a day at the half mile pole, went at it with
 SMOOTH WITH A KICK from the top of the bend to its end, was put to a drive spinning onto the head of the stretch, opened up during the ensuing furlong,
 saw the runner up chip away at the deficit, held away. RAZEENA abandoned the inside for path two at the top of the turn, eager to avoid being stuck behind
 a retreating TRIUMPHANT, got driven five wide into the lane, gained ground in a steadfast manner in the last eighth en route for the place. SMOOTH WITH
 A KICK two to three wide, disputed the pace on the turn, made it into the stretch and gave way. CAIRO CUTIE strung out four wide on the turn, got put to a
 prolonged drive, turned into the stretch and bested the rest. HIGHTAILING at or near the two path to the quarter pole, was never in it. CAIRO QUEEN saved
 ground during the early stages, tipped into path three to steer past a retreating rival from the half mile pole, swung into the stretch and folded.
 TRIUMPHANT stopped after contending for the top from path two until the half mile pole, jogged her way down the stretch for the last minor slice of the pot.
