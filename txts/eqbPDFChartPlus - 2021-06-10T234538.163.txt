 Footnotes
 VIC'S PICK took over leaving the half mile pole and rated a long lead, responded to pressure midway on the turn and proved much the best under steady
 handling. LUCKY NED PEPPER chased the early pace from the outside, rounded the turn off the rail and settled for second; no match for the winner.
 STERLING JUDGE chased the pace from the outside, rounded the turn about the four path and won the nod for third. HARD ROCK SONDE chased the
 pace toward the inside and missed the nod for third. RETURN MY CALL gave chase from the three path and finished evenly. JEFFERSON ROCK chased
 the pace outside, rounded the turn in the five path and finished evenly. SWISS PHOENIX gave chase after angling toward the inside then faded off the rail
 rounding the turn. BEAU'S CROSSING came away a step slow, angled in to give chase and proved no factor. TEQUILA PROMISE came away a step slow,
 gave chase from the three and four paths and proved no factor.

 Footnotes
 ANDTHENTHERESTHAT tapered in through the front stretch, stalked the pace about the four path into the first turn then settled close two deep, pulled
 herself to the lead approaching the three eighths pole, edged clear past the five sixteenths, held well under steady handling then taken in hand through the
 final yards. JUSTANARCH rated the pace inside, was headed approaching the three eighths pole, gave chase past the pole, dropped back nearing the far
 turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn and dug in down the lane to hold on for second. VIOLA'S LEGACY settled back in the three and four paths, bid leaving the
 seven sixteenths pole, improved at the rail rounding the far turn and was just up for third. BLAME JULIE saved some ground close to the early pace, bid
 leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then outfinished for third late. MORNINGAFTERBLUES broke in to make
 contact with Quincys Way then raced in the five path the opening turn, settled outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths, rounded the far turn
 still in the five path and showed little more. GO WILLOW GO raced well off the pace inside the opening turn, eased out entering the backstretch, bid leaving
 the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little further. QUEEN COURAGE became edgy just as the gate was opening and
 was consequently unprepared for the break. QUINCYS WAY was bumped at the break then saved ground. ZENARINA saved some ground into the first turn
 and was through after a half mile. The steward posted the inquiry to review the start of this race before declaring it official.

 Footnotes
 NO SIR REE BOB was bumped at the start by Ready to Fire and settled off the pace on the outside, bid at the five-sixteenths pole and steadily improved
 through the turn in the seven path, drew to near even terms past the eighth pole, then was carried out while dueling down the lane on the outside and came
 up first in the final strides. JOHN DOTHEN settled off the pace inside at a distant third, eased out near the five-sixteenths pole and bid just past that pole,
 took over midway through the turn in the five path, was met at near even terms past the eighth pole, then dueled down the lane while drifting out and
 carrying Deandrea's Pride out, and was caught in the final strides. CATCH MY CABOOSE stalked the pace on the outside and took over near the half pole,
 dueled through the backstretch and the turn in the three path, was caught at the quarter pole and dropped back, then leveled off in the stretch.
 DEANDREA'S PRIDE broke in and bumped Ready to Fire at the start, angled in shortly thereafter and settled well back on the outside, bid leaving the
 three-eighths pole and rounded the turn in the three path, then passed tired rivals down the lane and leveled off near the wire. READY TO FIRE was
 bumped at the start by Deandrea's Pride and into No Sir Ree Bob, and was never a factor. OUR LITTLE JULIO rated a pressured pace inside and was
 caught near the half pole, dueled through the backstretch and the turn on the rail, took over again at the quarter pole, then was caught mid-turn and faded.

 Footnotes
 DEREK'S COP E CAT exchanged contact with Sterling Furiosa leaving the gate and was hustled along to pressure the pace past the three eighths pole,
 dug in for the lead mid-stretch, raced briefly clear then held on under steady encouragement. GORGEOUS ROAD gave chase from the three path, rounded
 the turn off the rail, angled out leaving the turn, dug in to take second in later yards and was gaining on the winner. Hustled along to take the lead past the
 three eighths pole, ROCKSTAR PRINCESS set a pressured pace, was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. STERLING FURIOSA
 exchanged contact with Derek's Cop E Cat, picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn in the five path and showed little down the lane. HUEHUE
 chased the leaders well off the rail, drifted leaving the turn and had little more. CLASSY RHAPSODY gave chase off the rail then weakened rounding the
 turn. RAVEN'S SONDE chased the pace from the three path, steadied briefly in the vicinity of the three eighths pole, fell past the five sixteenths and had to
 be euthanized. The stewards reviewed the incident past the five sixteenths pole before declaring it official.

 Footnotes
 MICOZZI stalked the pace on the outside, improved through the backstretch and took over past the five-sixteenths pole without encouragement, rounded
 the turn in the three path, then dueled down the lane and just lasted first. MACANAO settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole and
 rounded the turn in the four path, then dug in down the lane on the outside and drew to near even terms at the sixteenths pole, dueled through the final
 sixteenth, and just missed first. UNTETHERED settled off the pace on the outside, angled in through the backstretch and bid approaching the five-sixteenths
 pole, rounded the turn on the rail, then moved to the outside past the eighth pole and gained down the stretch, closing on the top two, and just missing
 second. ENASOIT hustled up and angled in to rate a clear pace inside, was caught past the five-sixteenths pole and was urged from that point, rounded
 both turns on the rail, the rider lost his whip past the three-sixteenths pole, then dueled through the upper stretch and leveled off in the final sixteenth. NUKE
 LALOOSH settled well back on the outside and bid at the five-sixteenths pole, started the turn in the five path and angled in mid-turn, then raced down the
 lane nearest the rail and finished evenly. ATTEMPT TO DREAM settled off the pace on the outside, bid past the three-eighths pole and took the turn in the
 five path, then leveled off in the stretch. PORT MORE settled off the pace inside but was through early. BIG BRANCH broke a step slow and was never a
 factor. CAUSE HE'S WESTERN was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 BELIEVE THE HEAT chased the pace toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail, eased out leaving the turn, rallied to the front in later yards and drew
 clear approaching the wire. LIL'L ALLSTAR hustled up past the half mile pole to set a pressured pace, was caught in later yards but held on for second.
 PUNCH YOUR BROTHER came away sharply with a brief early lead then picked up the chase past the half mile pole, rounded the turn in the four path,
 finished well and was gaining on the runner-up. UPPERVILLE chased the pace toward the inside, rounded the turn off the rail and finished evenly. TWO
 PUNCH SMART gave chase about the four path and finished evenly. UP THE POWER chased the leaders toward mid track, rounded the turn in the six
 path and showed little further. CHUBBY BUB gave chase from the three path and showed little down the lane. LOUD angled to the outside and raced wide
 on the turn. UNSTOPPABLE SPEED gave chase toward the outside and was not a factor. CODYLICIOUS was never a factor.
