 FOREVER THE CHIEF was settled mid pack to the second turn, circled four wide while rallying to the stretch then continued to respond and pushed past
 PEPPER MAGIC late. PEPPER MAGIC tracked the pace to the second turn, moved up three wide to engage for the lead to the stretch, resisted the winner
 leaving mid stretch but was bested late. HOUSE OF CHANCE hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure from the rail to the second turn, battled
 determinedly to mid stretch but weakened in the late stages. GOTTA GET LUCKY hopped slightly at the start but recovered quickly and settled, saved
 ground on the second turn then could not offer the needed response in the drive. THE BOLD ONE pressed the pace to the second turn, got outrun to the
 stretch and finished evenly. SIGN STEALER trailed throughout.

 EXCENTRA was outsprinted early, raced three wide to the stretch then finished willingly to be along for a deadheat for second. WILLIE'S ANGEL stalked
 the pace two wide to the stretch, rallied to duel to mid stretch then was outkicked and hung late. MARINA DEL MAR pressed the pace two wide to the
 stretch, pushed up to duel to mid stretch but weakened in the late stages to just miss second. QUICK SUNSET chased the pace to the turn, came two wide
 to the stretch then lacked a closing response. MISLEADING hustled along to get the lead, set the pace but lugged out five wide on the turn, gave up the
 advantage and gave way in the drive. CHATTY CAROLE had no speed and was not a factor.

 deep stretch but was outfinished while second best. ORCHESTRAL contested the pace two wide to the stretch, dug in to deep stretch then was also

 stretch then shifted out and came on for the place. CAPTAIN CARL tracked the leader to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid

 Footnotes
 ONE SON OF A CHIEF broke alertly and went right to the front, set the pace, saved ground to the stretch then responded when set down and edged clear
 under steady pressure. BARTON LODGE (IRE) never far back to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch, was outkicked by the winner but dug in
 late to hold second. NOWHERE MAN was in tight and steadied nearing the first turn, settled on the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch then was no
 threat to the winner but finished steadily and just missed second. AMERICAN LEAGUE prompted the winner while two wide, was between rivals on the
 second turn then was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. NOBODYDANCESSOBOR tracked the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the
 stretch then gave way leaving mid stretch. THE REF had no speed and was never a threat. KITTENMEISTER was always outrun.
