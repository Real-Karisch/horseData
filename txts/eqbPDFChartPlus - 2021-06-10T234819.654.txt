 Footnotes
 HALLIE JAE was unhurried to the second turn, advanced two then three wide to the stretch, pushed up to engage for the lead in upper stretch, dueled to
 deep stretch then inched away under steady urging. ALY'S LAST MAGIC also raced unhurried, stalked to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the
 stretch, rallied through the drive but was bested by the winner. LIFE NO PAROLE trailed to the second turn, swung out and circled five wide to the stretch
 then finished willingly but was held off. SHARP COOKIE prompted the pace to the second turn, moved up to duel for the lead to the stretch, responded to
 mid stretch but was weakening late. THAT'S YOUR STORY set the pace for five and a half furlongs then tired.

 Footnotes
 BELLANZA was away quickly to clear the field, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then turned back MATTER OF LUCK and held gamely. MATTER OF
 LUCK chased the winner from the rail to the stretch, responded inside to mid stretch to loom a threat but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. SOUTHERN
 TREASURE was also chasing to the turn, came two wide to the stretch, moved closer to mid stretch then could not threaten the top two. CROIX DU SOLEIL
 broke awkwardly and had no speed, swung four wide mid turn but lacked the needed late response. LEGAL AFFAIR was tracked to the turn, raced three
 wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. NEWCOMB broke straight in the air at the start, lost about eight lengths and was not a factor.

 BARTON LODGE (IRE) stalked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, angled out for room in upper stretch, rallied to the front leaving the
 furlong grounds and held driving. ONE TUFF MINISTER tracked the pace to the half, bid three wide to get to terms into the stretch, dueled to mid stretch
 then could not stall the winner but held second. STAR EXPRESS was on the pace from the rail for six furlongs, responded to mid stretch then was tiring in
 the final furlong. PACIFIC CHANNEL had no speed, settled to the second turn, tried to rally three deep to the stretch but could not make an impact in the
 drive. DARCURTS HOPE hesitated and broke a step slow, had no speed and was never a threat. VENTURI attended the pace outside of STAR EXPRESS
 to the second turn but tired after six furlongs.

 FIERY LADY never far back to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then skimmed the rail in the drive and finished determinedly to prevail. SIMMY'S
 TEMPLE (GB) was allowed to settle to the half, came two wide to the stretch then shifted out for room and finished willingly. SHEEZA SASSY GIRL
 prompted the pace to the half, moved alongside LUCKY CHRISTIANA and dueled that one to mid stretch but was outfinished in the late stages. LUCKY
 CHRISTIANA went right to the front, set the pace to the second turn, responded when hooked by SHEEZA SASSY GIRL, stayed on to deep stretch then
 weakened late. LADY BEWARE (IRE) tracked the pace to the second turn, shifted off the rail into the stretch then closed belatedly to the line. EVERYBODY
 DOES IT trailed to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch but was not a threat in the drive. SHARI had no speed and was outrun.

 GLOBALIZATION had good speed, dueled from the rail to the stretch, was headed in mid stretch but dug in determinedly and bested RULE NMBER EIGHT
 late. RULE NUMBER EIGHT The latter attended the pace outside the winner, pushed up to take a short lead nearing mid stretch, could not shake loose and
 was outfinished for the win. LION COMMAND got outsprinted to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then closed ground belatedly. LUKE THIRTEEN
 tracked the top two early, was fanned three wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. LIL' CHIEFTAIN tracked the pace to the turn,
 was forced to circle four wide to the stretch and came up empty in the drive. GOING FOR THE WIRE lagged to the stretch and was never a factor. FIRST
 STONE had no speed, raced two wide on the turn but gave way in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 FORT CADY was unhurried to the half, rallied three wide into the second turn, swung out and circled five wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid
 stretch and edged clear driving. PAPA KADE attended the pace to the second turn, dueled three wide to the stretch, was overtaken by the winner in mid
 stretch but dug in late to hold the place. MOOGIE WOOGIE settled mid pack to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch and was making a
 mild run late. UNDERWRITE hustled to the front, was collared and dueled PAPA KADE to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. JAYHAWKER
 tracked the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. EXTENSIVE broke in the air and lost about
 six lengths at the start, was outrun to the stretch and did not threaten. JASON X L chased the leaders to the second turn then saved ground to no avail.
 OUTDOORSMAN GENE had no speed and was not a factor. CURLY BOY chased the pace to the half, bid two wide to the stretch but faded in the final
 furlong.
