 Footnotes
 AMALUNA was allowed to settle early, advanced steadily inside around the turn, shifted to the two-path for the drive, caught SOUTHERNPERFECTION
 from the outside a sixteenth out and drew clear. MISS CONTESSA raced in closest attendance to the pacesetter for six furlongs, and kept on willingly to get
 the place in the closing yards. SOUTHERNPERFECTION dashed clear early inside, remained well clear into the stretch, began to labor entering the final
 furlong, could not hold off the winner near the sixteenth-pole, and lost the place late. ORO BIRD chased the leaders four to three wide, and lacked the
 needed late bid outside. BELLA VINCENZA raced three to four wide and was outrun. UNTRUE was going along between horses three wide when she had
 her heels clipped nearing the seven-sixteenths, and dropped back. RADIANTRITHYM was keyed up early, and was in the process of dropping back from
 between horses when she clipped the heels of RADIANTRITHYM and stumbled approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, then trailed the rest of the way.

 last furlong while drifting out, and could not hold off the top one. MODERN TALE raced four wide on the turn, and finished well outside too late. GO GONE
 GONE vied for command outside I'M CARDINAL to upper stretch, and weakened. LITTLE BALTAR was outrun four wide to the lane, and improved position
 on the far outside. BLACK JET pressed the pace between horses early, and weakened after three furlongs. HENNY HEFNER was no factor three wide.
 GREELY IS BACK was no factor in the two-path. RICHEST GIFTS was outrun inside. THE ZIP ZIP MAN broke sluggishly and was never close. WEST OF

 Footnotes
 HILL VALLEY stalked just behind the leaders inside, moved out three wide past the quarter-pole, ranged up outside CREATIVE AWARD and brushed with
 that one while attempting to lug in through deep stretch, and edged away with the rider tugging sternly with the right rein. CREATIVE AWARD hooked up in
 an early duel for the lead outside MISS HARRY, gain the upper hand from the latter by midstretch as HILL VALLEY arrived on the scene, went shoulder to
 shoulder brushing with that one in deep stretch, and came up second best. MISS HARRY dueled for the lead inside CREATIVE AWARD to upper stretch,
 and weakened through the final furlong. BIMINI stumbled at the start, circled five wide off the turn and could not gain. CREEDIBILITY stayed in range four
 wide to the top of the stretch, and had no rally. FARFALLA bobbled at the start, stalked outside the leaders three wide, and gave way near the top of the
 stretch.

 MAGNATO GO sprinted clear soon after the start, rated along inside to the lane, and responded to pressure to preserve the decision while drifting out.
 DREAMINGOFMERMAIDS chased from close range inside early, shifted out with a clear shot in the three-path through upper stretch, and was slowly
 getting to the winner near the wire. TUESDAY'S ROSE had aim three then four wide, but could not make any significant headway outside the top two late.
 KAYLIE'S GIRL chased outside MAGNATO GO from the outset, loomed a threat turning for home, could not get by and weakened late. PAOLA shifted out
 four wide nearing the stretch, and could not reach contention. ENIGMATICA tossed her head just prior to the start and broke in the air, and was never close
 three wide. CETARA saved ground and was always outrun. CLASSIC ACT raced two wide and was finished after three-eighths of a mile.

 Footnotes
 CATSOUTOFTHEBAG attended the pace between horses up the backstretch, bumped with UNCOMMON FACTOR and steadied losing position into the far
 turn, regrouped to go after COME STORMING from the outside in upper stretch, edged past that one entering the last furlong and held off a trio of late
 challengers. STARLIGHT RIDGE raced two wide in the second flight to midway on the far turn, tipped out to the four-path after straightening away for the
 drive, and finished strongly to get up for the place. IT'S COMPLICATED settled in the middle of the field two wide to the far turn, shifted out wider
 approaching the lane, had aim outside the leaders through the furlong grounds, and was outkicked between horses for second. HENNY'S TREASURE
 broke alertly and had easy striking range saving ground, came off the rail turning for home and finished willingly through traffic in the two-path. JUST CHILL
 broke two lengths slow, circled up five wide late on the far turn, shifted in being outkicked through deep stretch and wound up in traffic behind the leaders
 near the line. COME STORMING quickly grabbed the lead, rated along inside to the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner entering the last furlong and
 gave way. ITALIAN SUMMER awaited room in the second flight around the far turn, checked on the rail behind HENNY'S TREASURE past the quarter-pole,
 got a clear lane on the fence in upper stretch and showed some mild interest. CASSIDY'S SMILE steadied in traffic inside then two wide nearing the top of
 the lane, and lacked a solid response. MAYBELLE circled five wide late on the far turn, and made no impact. WAR ROSE was pushed out five wide by
 UNCOMMON FACTOR heading into the first turn, then steadied behind horses nearing the top of the stretch. UNCOMMON FACTOR broke two lengths
 slow, was keyed up four wide to the first turn, dragged herself forward entering the backstretch to press the pace outside rivals, bumped with the eventual
 winner entering the far turn, and had nothing left. SWEET GELATO stayed in range early three wide, was steadied and shuffled back approaching the
 stretch, and retreated.

 Footnotes
 FLAT OUT FLYING was slow into stride and lagged well back for a half-mile, came five wide gathering momentum off the turn, caught FOR THE ROAD
 near the 70-yard marker and won going away. FOR THE ROAD sped clear early, built a sizeable advantage under a drive turning for home, began to labor
 on the wrong lead entering the final furlong and was no match for the winner. GATOR FIFTY TWO saved ground throughout, was closest to the pacesetter
 near the eighth-pole, then weakened. SWEET KAYDEN stumbled sharply and bumped into NOMAD at the start, recovered to prompt the pace outside, and
 faded soon after going a half. EBRIO was hemmed in along the rail behind the pacesetter through the first half-mile, gained clearance two wide late on the
 turn, and came up empty. BEACOS DISCO PANTS was outrun two wide. SAN DIEGO SLUGGER gave way four wide at the top of the stretch. NOMAD
 bumped with SWEET KAYDEN and bobbled after the start, and never reached contention inside.

 Footnotes
 CAPTAIN GAUGHEN waited patiently around the turn two then three wide, was guided out to the four-path being roused to upper stretch, and responded
 well to draw off late under a mild drive. GRAN MALBEC took the lead at once, rated along inside to the stretch, could not contain the top one but dug in to
 save the place. WHENTHEDOVESCRY bumped with EPIC DRAMA at the start, was outsprinted two wide to the stretch, and finished willingly. BUSHROD
 loomed a threat three wide approaching the stretch, flattened out past the eighth-pole and could not hold the show while difficult to handle very late.
 DIDDLEY raced in midpack four wide around the turn, and offered a mild response through the lane. SMALL FORTUNE pressed the pace between horses,
 and faded in upper stretch. EPIC DRAMA was pinched back between rivals at the start, came off the rail into the stretch and was one-paced late.
 MOONWALKER broke out at the start, raced two to three wide on the turn, and had no rally. TENACITY ZIP was hemmed in early chasing after GRAN
 MALBEC, and tired inside. CITY ROC broke outward and awkwardly with his head down, and was outrun inside.

 Footnotes
 PINK SANDS was slow to get going and outrun for a half-mile, began moving under a drive three wide entering the turn, swept up in the five-path to take
 over into the stretch, and drew away under brisk urging. TREASURE IN HEAVEN lacked room along the inside behind the leaders late on the turn, shifted
 out steadily through upper stretch and finished well. FOCUSED was outrun to the turn two wide, cut the corner into the lane and finished evenly. GIANNA'S
 GIFT vied inside TRUE BOOTS for better than a half-mile, turned for home being hounded by several pursuers, and gave way in the two-path. AERIAL
 ASSETS bumped with LISA'S ESCARPMENT at the start, raced in striking range three then four wide through the turn, was outmoved just inside the winner
 at the top of the stretch, then brushed with WHIP ME INTO SHAPE after fading from contention. WHIP ME INTO SHAPE chased between rivals into the
 turn, was beaten to a spot trying to get out to the three-path past the quarter-pole, angled widest, then lugged in late brushing with AERIAL ASSETS as they
 both weakened. TRUE BOOTS contested the pace outside GIANNA'S GIFT two to three wide, and gave way coming off the turn. LISA'S ESCARPMENT
 bumped with AERIAL ASSETS at the start, raced widest early, moved in for the run around the turn and dropped steadily further behind.

 Footnotes
 LOVER'S KEY hopped at the start to get off slowly, recovered to the middle of the field four wide into the backstretch, remained well out in the course
 rallying off the far turn, and closed steadily to get up outside. VENDITA saved ground in range from the start, slipped through on the fence inside SIERRA
 ALEONE in deep stretch with a solid bid and just missed. SANITY raced in the second flight two to three wide to the top of the stretch, and finished with
 good energy outside the top two to get up for the show. SIERRA ALEONE led around the first turn in the two-path pursued by several foes, established
 command clear up the backstretch, was challenged from the outside by VOLATILITY INDEX coming off the far turn, dug in to fight that rival off, then was
 overrun late from both flanks. CONQUEST HARDCANDY pressed the pace three wide between foes into the first turn, backed off moving inside after a
 quarter-mile or so, lacked room behind the leaders late on the far turn, and remained boxed in through the stretch run. VOLATILITY INDEX went along in
 easy striking range three wide, challenged outside SIERRA ALEONE in upper stretch, could not get past that one and was overtaken by several others in
 the final yards. INDIAN PAINT shifted out from the back approaching the stretch, and ran on evenly outside late. LAUR NET raced two wide early toward the
 rear, and remained out of contention angling wider to the stretch. EVITA CAPITANA (ARG) pressed the pace five then four wide around the first turn, and
 was finished soon after completing a half-mile. BATTLE JOINED suffered an injury while contesting the pace around the first turn and was vanned off.

 Footnotes
 OFF TOPIC raced off the early pace four wide, remained well out in the track beginning to get underway early on the far turn, reached contention from the
 outside in upper stretch, and outfinished MALIBU RAINBOW to the first finish line. MALIBU RAINBOW tucked in along the rail behind the early leaders,
 lodged a bid between horses turning for home, switched leads awkwardly and shifted in several paths in deep stretch, and could not reach the top one.
 WEB O' GOLD was bumped between horses after the start, raced two wide to the far turn within range, had an open pathway on the rail to upper stretch,
 but lacked a solid bid. MAKEALITLEMISCHIEF was fractious behind the gate, bumped with WEB O' GOLD after the start, went up to set the pace in the
 two-path, fought on inside the top two finishers past the eighth-pole, then took up sharply when MALIBU RAINBOW veered over in front of her.
 SHACKLETTE stumbled badly going to her knees at the start, raced three to four wide, and lacked a rally. SWEET BLOSSOM bumped with WEB O' GOLD
 after the start, saved ground and tired after six furlongs. LUCKY LITTLE LADY pressed the pace outside MAKEALITLEMISCHIEF, and tired after six
 furlongs. TRIUMPHANT raced four wide in range early, and was finished on the far turn. CALL ME FANCY hit the left side of the gate and was off slow
 despite urging, and was never close. WRONG COLOR steadied from between rivals in the four-path going to the first turn, and continued wide being outrun.
 FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MAKEALITLEMISCHIEF AGAINST MALIBU RAINBOW, THE LATTER
 WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
