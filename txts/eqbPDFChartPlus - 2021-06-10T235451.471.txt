 Footnotes
 POLO ART chased the pacesetter from the two then the three path through late turn, bid into the lane from the four path, quickly moved past into the lane,
 widened to the eighth pole and was kept under a drive to slowly widen further to the wire. STEEL SHOT was slow early, raced in the three to the two path
 through the turn, moved into the lane from the inside and moved up for the place spot while never a threat to the top one. ALLIDOISDREAMOFYOU raced
 near the rail into the turn, came off the inside through late turn, entered the lane from the four path and could not gain while saving the show spot. SHIP
 STALKER was steadied between rivals soon after the start, raced in the two path through the turn and moved up while never a menace. CHIP VAN
 WINKLE bobbled at the start, raced along the inside through the turn and never was a factor. BUGGY BROWN chased the pace from the three path through
 the turn then faded through the lane. MINI MILES set the pace from the two path into late turn then folded up through the lane.

 Footnotes
 ROMPED vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, dueled with runner-up through the lane while drifting off the rail into the three path and gamely
 held while inching up slightly late. DEACON chased the dueling leaders into mid-turn, moved up to press the pace into the lane, dueled with the winner the
 final eighth and was denied. KENTUCKY PEERLESS was racing between rivals early then settled back to chase the pace while in the three path, continued
 in the three path through the turn, angled into the five path for the drive and was all out to gain the show spot. MORE THAN CHARMING vied for the lead
 while racing in the four to the three path through the turn, continued in the five path into the lane while still a serious contender then weakened. STRONG
 TIDE was in the four path through late turn, raced near the rail through the lane and gained mildly. BRODYTHEOXMAN was never a factor while along the
 inside through the turn and into the lane. MAGIC MICHAEL ran off about three-eights off a mile while waiting to be loaded, was caught and loaded, raced in
 the five path through the turn while near the back, drifted in to the two path through the lane and was never in it.

 Footnotes
 BRITISH HUMOR tracked the pace while in the two path through the turn, moved closer to the inside into the lane, waited for room in upper lane while
 brushing with another, split rivals near the eighth pole and finished with a rush to be up in time. WINCHESTER LIMIT pressed the leader two wide into the
 backstretch, moved to the lead into the far turn, cleared into the lane, grabbed his largest advantage with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner
 safe. VICTOR LOUNGE (IRE) was in the three path through the turns when moving into contention, bid from the four path into the lane and was slowly
 gaining to the wire. J W RUCKUS settled back into the far turn, was asked for more into the lane while swing widest and finished with energy to be gaining
 at the wire. BAYTOWN JIMBO was along the inside through the turn, came off the inside into the lane, was brushed by another straightening into the lane
 and offered a mild bid. CAROLINA BEACH hopped at the start, brushed the gate spotting the field some three lengths, raced in the four path through the far
 turn and never was a serious factor. SHADOW OF JUSTICE was never a factor while in the two path through the turns. KAMACHA set the pace into the far
 turn then gave way in late turn.

 Footnotes
 NO CENTS LEFT bid four wide in early stretch and was clear late under mild urging. MUSTANG CAT vied three wide, was clear, then caught late.
 STRONGBOX stalked the pace in the three path, bid between foes at the quarter pole, then couldn't close. ZAPPER race in the four path, bid, then faltered.
 DAKOTA SHY stalked inside, then faded. CONFEDERATE RAGS pressed the pace in the three path, then faded. COMMENDATION vied for a half mile
 before fading. MIND BOTTLING was not a factor. WILD HAIR was bumped at the start, then was eased.
