 Footnotes
 DANCE TILL DAWN dueled early outside MERTZ, cleared off and moved to the rail into the turn, received challenges from CORN OFF THE COB and
 SALSITA ROJA midway on the bend, dug in and outfought both of them through the lane and was going away late. CORN OFF THE COB bid for command
 between horses on the turn, reached a short lead outside DANCE TILL DAWN in midstretch, but was outgamed from there. FEATURE CREATURE was
 outrun three wide into the turn, and rallied on the far outside to get a share of show at the wire. SALSITA ROJA loomed menacingly three wide midway
 around the turn, stayed on to the furlong grounds and weakened late. LEARN STORY (DOM) broke slowly, advanced mildly three wide on the turn, and
 lacked the needed late response. ADAMANT checked sharply along the inside leaving the backstretch, moved to the two-path and failed to recover.
 DRAMA FREE bounced off the left side of the gate at the start, steadied slightly in the two-path nearing the turn and was through early. MERTZ dueled early
 inside DANCE TILL DAWN, and faded steadily after three-eighths of a mile.

 Footnotes
 BATTLE OF MEMPHIS (IRE) was four wide into the first turn before moving in slightly, maintained striking distance up the backstretch, ranged up outside
 after six furlongs under confident handling, took over from GREAT KAHUNA after straightening away for the drive, and drew away under pressure.
 DOWNSIDE RISK was shut off and steadied behind J P'S PRIDE to get away several lengths behind the others, trailed inside early, angled four wide
 getting in gear approaching the stretch, and finished well. PREACHER POWER went along under a firm grasp in the two-path early, lost some position
 leaving the backstretch and was forced to go five wide late on the far turn, and lacked the needed late kick. GREAT KAHUNA was bumped lightly by J P'S
 PRIDE at the start, rated along on a clear lead for almost six furlongs, could not fend off the winner turning for home and gave way late on the rail. J P'S
 PRIDE (IRE) broke out in front of DOWNSIDE RISK and bumped lightly with GREAT KAHUNA at the start, saved ground to the stretch and had no rally.
 STREET GIANT broke alertly and was three wide close-up into the first turn, prompted the pace through the middle splits, came under a ride in the two-path
 on the far turn, but had no response and dropped back. SKY SOLO raced three wide, stopped midway on the far turn, and lost contact through the lane.

 encouragement. ICATIRO got bumped repeatedly at the start and lost action, shifted to outside and raced off the pace, commenced steady four wide bid in
 the turn, put to drive entering top stretch, made solid run for THE GIPPER but could not get to rival. FRENCH QUARTER broke out and bumped bit at the
 start, tracked the pace along inside then edged closer along rail at half mile marker, patiently ridden awaiting clear path in the turn then got clear top stretch,
 set down for the drive, raced in striking range at furlong marker then finished evenly. DIDDLEY broke in and bumped back and forth with rivals at the start,
 tracked three wide through the backstretch, got in tight quarters near three sixteenth pole then got clear and finished evenly. CHIRPING came out and off
 step slow after the break, raced in the back then drifted out wide leaving the backstretch and continued wide in the stretch to no avail. R LIMO JOE
 slammed back and forth at the start then rushed up and took over the lead, challenged by the winner mid-turn, failed to keep pace and retreated upper
 stretch. AFTER STEWARDS INQUIRY AND JOCKEY'S OBJECTION #3 AGAINST #7 AT THE START, STEWARDS RULED NO CHANGE TO ORDER

 Footnotes
 GRAN PARAISO steadied and bumped into JO DI BAGGIO 's hind end when ELGIN ESCAPE came over in front of him past the three-quarter pole, moved
 three wide challenging for command midway on the turn, edged away from challengers on both flanks in upper stretch, and held firm to turn back JOE DI
 BAGGIO through the late stages. The latter had his hind end bumped by GRAN PARAISO going by the six-furlong marker, stayed close into the turn, swung
 four wide issuing a bid at the top of the lane, loomed through the furlong grounds and was clearly second best. HE'S SMOKIN HOT was sent up to vie early
 inside, backed off past the half-mile pole, came through with a rebid on the fence around the turn, and weakened through the drive. ARRIVEDERLA set a
 pressured pace in the two-path, was surrounded by attackers through the latter portion of the turn, and gave way between rivals in upper stretch.
 JUSTCALLMENORMAN steadied slightly between horses leaving the chute, moved inside and did not factor. ELGIN ESCAPE pressed the pace outside,
 retreated after a half and drifted wide tiring into the lane.

 MATZO BELLA broke near the lead and dueled for position, continued to battle with MIAMI ROSE then got by rival while taking on ROTATE, battled turning
 for home then edged away to slim lead and held on in final stride. BYE BYE NICKY got bumped at the start then came out wider, steadily moved closer to
 inside, raced two wide leaving the backstretch, still ways off the pace in the turn then guided to outside upper stretch, kicked in gamely, surged to wire and
 just missed. A FERA dueled for the lead in opening stages then raced just off the top flight, began edging back up late turn then set down for the drive,
 continued to inch way up closer to wire and just missed. ROTATE dueled for the lead through the turn, could not match strides with MATZO BELLA top
 stretch but remained in close contention then gaveway late. ARMS WIDE OPEN forwardly placed along rail in opening stages, bit tight along rail and raced
 just off top flight, made two wide bid near the quarter pole, under steady urging just off inside then finished evenly. BLUE EYED BETH raced outside under
 snug hold to rate off the top flight, dropped closer to inside late backstretch then under a ride racing four wide at the quarter pole, came out wider top stretch
 then angled in and flattened out. CHIQUI THE GRAY raced off the pace under steady urging, three wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. MIAMI
 ROSE dueled for the lead then failed to keep pace mid-turn and weakened. VIGILANTE JUSTICE lacked speed and failed to gain contention. DERBY DAY
 JEWEL broke in and took solid bump at the start and failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 LIVIN A DREAM broke out bumping VIOLENT DANGER at the start, maneuvered outside midway up the backstretch, moved after the leaders three wide
 past the five-sixteenths, took over and edged away in midstretch, drifted out under left-hand pressure approaching the sixteenth-pole, straightened out as
 the rider switched right-handed and remained clear. ROYAL ASSCHER prompted the pace outside VIOLENT DANGER, was outmoved by LIVIN A DREAM
 late on the turn and into the stretch, kept on with good courage leaving the furlong grounds, swapped leads late and did not have enough between rivals.
 PRADO VISION broke inward hitting the left side of the gate to get away slowest, advanced four wide coming off the turn, had aim outside the leaders
 through deep stretch but lacked the needed final surge. VIOLENT DANGER was bumped between horses at the start, went up to grab the early lead, got
 collared by LIVIN A DREAM turning for home, and weakened through the lane on the wrong lead. ARCELOR stayed close early, and faded on the rail
 around the turn. SPECIAL COUNSEL bumped with VIOLENT DANGER at the start, raced three to four wide around the turn, and gave way after six
 furlongs. DREAMY ART was ridden along two wide with no response around the turn, and dropped far back. FOLLOWING A STEWARD'S INQUIRY, AS
 WELL AS OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDERS OF ROYAL ASSCHER AND PRADO VISION FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN
 DEEP STRETCH, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

 Footnotes
 CLEAR FOR ACTION came out step after start and brushed with rival then sped to the lead, secured inside position in the first turn, set the pace running
 through the backstretch, held slim lead over BUNYAN'S AXE in final turn, began to edge away still unleashed approaching turn for home, given cue upper
 stretch, quickly drew off and finished in hand. CAPE DESIDERATO raced two wide in the first turn then settled off the early pace, commenced steady three
 wide bid through final turn, shifted wider upper stretch under strong left handed drive and finished with response to clear place. BUNYAN'S AXE broke well
 and steadily angled to inside nearing first turn, raced in stalking position behind the leader through the backstretch, edged up closer and raced in aim at
 three eights pole, came under a ride, could not reach eventual winner but kept under steady urging and raced along for share. ALPHADAR brushed and
 slightly steadied at the start then allowed to settle and saved ground in first turn, switched out a path and continued unhurried through the backstretch,
 moved through far turn three wide then came under a ride racing three to five wide and improved position in the lane. TROPICAL COGNAC was bit keyed
 up in early going and raced up close under firm rating then settled, raced three wide poised to strike at three eights pole, launched bid for leader, could not
 reach then gave way in the lane. COLIN A WINNER raced in range positioned five paths wide, hustled up four wide at the quarter pole, failed to kick on then
 drifted in couple paths while under left handed urging. SHANGHAI LEVI was bit keen being rated in early stages then settled more, saved ground along
 inside, hustled up in far turn then failed to move on in the lane. SECOND ENCORE raced near mid-range positioned along inside, hustled up two wide at the
 quarter pole but failed to kick on. STUCK WITH YOU raced off the pace, commenced steady bid through far turn but failed to gain threatening position.
 SOUPER WARRIOR saved ground racing off the pace and lacked a needed rally. CHRISTMAS TREAT raced in the back and failed to respond when called
 upon.

 Footnotes
 HIGH FLYING GUY advanced inside up the backstretch, sat off the dueling leaders for a bit before going after them three wide, took over five-sixteenths
 from home and was driven clear, and had enough to turn back MCMANAMAN through deep stretch. MCMANAMAN tried to rear up edgy in the gate prior to
 the start, then broke slowly, improved position going to the turn, bid outside HIGH FLYING GUY into the lane, kept on with good courage unable to get by,
 and was clearly second best. KID MAC COOL raced four wide around the turn, lacked a solid bid through the stretch and just saved the show. HIGH RISK
 STRATEGY bumped with KING BILI at the start, lagged in the second flight two then three wide, and rallied mildly inside KID MAC COOL just missing third
 money. FAMILY KITTEN bumped lightly with KING BILI after the start, vied outside MORE ILLUSIONS early, moved inside getting hooked by HIGH
 FLYING GUY around the turn, and weakened on the rail into the stretch. MORE ILLUSIONS vied for command inside FAMILY KITTEN early, and gave way
 midway on the turn. KING BILI bumped with HIGH RISK STRATEGY at the start, then bumped lightly with FAMILY KITTEN a stride later, was driven four
 wide on the turn and failed to respond. TAGORE moved inside approaching the turn, and faded steadily.

 Footnotes
 MO'S RIDE steadied while a bit unsettled behind horses going to the first turn, saved ground to the far turn, was guided out four wide advancing after six
 furlongs, took over through the furlong grounds, and edged away while lugging in greenly. INDISPUTABLYLINKED got bumped by JETT RINK at the start,
 moved in from the two-path entering the backstretch, followed the leaders inside until shifting out three wide late on the far turn, bid through upper stretch
 between horses, and continued on with good courage for the place. WINE AT THE BEACH vied outside JETT RINK for six furlongs, got past that one in
 upper stretch but was immediately taken on by the first two finishers, and yielded in the two-path. JETT RINK broke out bumping INDISPUTABLYLINKED at
 the start, set a pressured pace inside WINE AT THE BEACH for six furlongs, and weakened in upper stretch. FORTUNICKLE hugged the rail throughout,
 bumped with KARAMCHAND approaching the far turn, and improved position without threatening. LITTLEROUGHJUSTICE stalked the leaders three wide,
 and dropped back between horses late on the far turn. PESCECANE edged a bit closer up the backstretch, was urged four wide into the far turn, and faded
 after six furlongs. KARAMCHAND bumped with FORTUNICKLE while outside that one approaching the far turn near the back, and remained outrun. IN
 GUS WE TRUST steadied after the start and was slow into stride, angled six or seven wide off the far turn and made no headway. SILVER DRILL showed
 brief speed between horses, and was finished after a half-mile. ZAMAN broke slowly, went four wide around the first turn, and was never in the hunt. BLACK
 TIE SHANGHAI trailed most of the way and drifted out well past the middle of the course into the stretch.
