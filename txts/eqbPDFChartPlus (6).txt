 Footnotes
 PLENTIFUL stalked the forced pace outside early, moved inside on the turn, rallied up the rail to take a short lead passing the sixteenth pole, held well to
 the wire. WITT'SDOLLARNIGHT stumbled at the break, pressed three-wide, kept coming to take the place. PAINT MY RIDE had inside speed under
 pressure, dueled stretch, gave best before giving away. HARD KNOCKS ROCK dueled outside, gave best before giving way. HOGAN showed little.
