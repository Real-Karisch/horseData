 Footnotes
 CALL WEST was hard sent between horses in the opening furlong, finally cleared off passing the half mile pole, widened around the turn and was driven
 into the lane, and won as much the best. NAUTICAL LEGACY was restrained at the start and trailed the field down the backstretch and around the turn,
 swung to the five path into the lane to rally outside of rivals, quickened in late stretch and got up for place at the wire while proving no match for the winner.
 KAMACHA dueled along the inside through the opening furlong, got outpaced passing the half mile pole as CALL WEST was hustled to clear, stalked in the
 two to three path around the turn, but proved no match for the leader into the lane, then weakened and got nipped for place while just holding show. LIL
 PISTOLA was slow to get going, then was outsprinted passing the half mile pole to be far off the pace into the turn, saved ground around the bend and
 ranged up for a place bid in upper stretch, but got outfinished and missed minor rewards. RESPECT THE BOSS dueled outside of KAMACHA and CALL
 WEST through the opening stages, but got outpaced as CALL WEST went on, chased that foe while three to four wide, then stopped in upper stretch.

 Footnotes
 BUCKEYE WARRIOR broke far back, then trailed after passing the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground while last around the turn, commenced a rally inside
 of rivals starting in upper stretch, split foes in the two path with a few lengths to make up on the tiring leader at the furlong marker, then sustained his drive
 and caught the exhausted leader at the wire. COUNTRY TAKE OUT broke a bit slow but quickly rushed to vie for the lead, cleared off from the field at the
 nine-sixteenths pole, widened his margin around the turn while in hand and confidently built a large lead into the lane, but weakened badly passing the
 furlong pole, stopped late, and got nipped at the wire. CELTIC LINE stalked along the inside, was driven into the turn, saved ground around the bend and
 achieved place inside a tiring rival at the furlong marker, but then got outfinished by BUCKEYE WARRIOR while still gaining on the leader in the late stages.
 HILLBILLY RICH set the pace along the inside for the opening furlong, but was outpaced by COUNTRY TAKE OUT passing the nine-sixteenths pole, then
 chased the loose leader around the turn, then shifted to the three path into the lane and faded. ROAD OF DIAMONDS stalked while two to three wide, was
 driven into the turn, but failed to respond and never made a bid. SHINE ON was squeezed back after the start, raced far off the pace, gained slightly outside
 of rivals while four wide around the turn, but weakened while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch.

 Footnotes
 SIMPLE PLEASURE broke well, but allowed AMERIBELLE to clear off around the first turn, stalked that foe from the two path, made a bid at the seven
 sixteenths pole and took over into the far turn, came into the lane in the three path and widened her margin under driving pressure and stayed clear to the
 wire. EVENSCORE vied for the lead into the first turn, but was restrained between horses around the bend, trailed into the backstretch and shifted four
 wide, advanced outside of horses in the five path around the far turn to be in range of place in upper stretch, but bolted outwards at the furlong marker as
 the rider switched to left handed pressure, but quickly recovered as the rider switched his stick back to his right hand, rallied late, and got up for place at the
 wire. MAJESTIC MYSTERY settled in midpack while three wide and outside of rivals around the first turn, chased from multiple lengths off of the leaders
 down the backstretch, then saved ground around the far turn but failed to threaten the leader before getting nipped at the wire for place. AMERIBELLE
 stumbled badly at the start but soon recovered, rushed forward outside of rivals and cleared off into the first turn, rated in hand down the backstretch, but
 was headed at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased around the far turn, but came into the lane in the four path and faded. PORTRAIT OF EMMA saved
 ground while far off the pace, and was never involved.

 Footnotes
 PROM THEME allowed the duelers to draw off, stalked them from the three path, gained swiftly in hand around the turn and took over with a strong bid
 passing the quarter pole, widened her margin under driving pressure on her left lead through the lane, and was ridden out. WILLIN' GRACE was outsprinted
 after a good break, was far off the pace after a half mile, advanced between horses in the four path around the turn, quickend at the furlong marker and got
 up for place late. LUSTY GIT YER GUN dueled in the two path, forged a lead from her dueling rival as PROM THEME threatened approaching the quarter
 pole, was no match for that rival into the lane and weakened late, but held show. OHIO SILVER settled far off the pace, split rivals in the two path into the
 turn, then stayed on in the lane with a mild rally, but missed show. ONE THIRTY ONE trailed early on, swung to the six path into the lane, and offered a mild
 rally while passing tired rivals. LOVE TOTEM dueled along the inside, but weakened passing the five-sixteenth pole and subsequently faded. KITTIAN HILL
 raced in midpack along the rail, saved ground through the turn, but was never involved. SUMMIT POINT settled in midpack, advanced in hand around the
 while tracking PROM THEME's bid, loomed boldly into the lane, but was no match for the leader in upper stretch while not being asked for her best run, then
 stopped under soft urging. FAST PAY hopped at the start, recovered to midpack and two wide between horses, inched closer passing the half mile pole, but
 faltered into the turn and stopped in the lane.

 Footnotes
 FANCY KELLY quickly cleared after the start, widened her advantage while in hand around the turn, was driven in upper stretch and built an insurmountable
 lead, but stayed on her left lead through the lane, and was geared down approaching the wire. ABIGAIL LEE bobbled at the start, advanced to race in
 midpack passing the half mile pole, sustained her advance into the turn, but was no match for the leader into the lane, achieved place approaching the
 furlong marker, and was a clear second best. HALO'S PHENOMENON was bumped at the start and very slow to get going, trailed the field into the turn,
 swung six wide into the lane and rallied outside of rivals for show. BEACH BABE stalked from the four to three path around the turn, but was outpaced
 between rivals into the lane, then stayed on and passed rivals for fourth. PERFECTINGTHEVIEW bumped at the start and raced far off the pace, was three
 wide around the turn and stayed on mildly between horses late. LIEBCHEN chased the pace setter while three wide and between horses around the turn,
 but proved no match, dug in for place into the lane, but weakened in the final sixteenth. FORMER BUNNY chased two wide, then inside around the turn
 while fading, but fought on for minor rewards in upper stretch before weakening late. ATLANTIS ROSE chased the pace form midpack along the rail,
 regressed into the turn, stopped around the bend, and showed little. SO GO MY LUCEILLE broke well, but was outsprinted, trailed into the lane and
 stopped, and showed little.

 DARWISH dueled in hand in the three path outside of rivals through the opening stages, took over easily into the turn, widened his margin around the bend
 and built a large lead in midstretch, then fended off HEBGONE's stout late charge to just hold on at the wire. HEBGONE stalked from the two path just off
 the early dueling leaders, but got outpaced as DARWISH drew off into the turn, advanced in the four path into the lane, quickened passing the furlong
 marker and rapidly closed in the late stages, but just missed at the wire. TOMMY C ME dueled between horses in the early stages, but got outpaced by
 them passing the seven sixteenths pole before proving no match for DARWISH into the lane, forged place around the turn, but weakened into the lane and
 got outfinished by HEBGONE at the furlong marker. SUPREME VENTURE was pinched back at the start, trailed the field in the early stages, saved ground
 and advanced around the turn, then offered a mild rally between horses in the lane for a minor reward. ON JOHN chased four wide, was outpaced and
 dropped back passing the half mile pole, then never threatened. MONGOLIAN HOLIDAY dueled along the inside, got outpaced into the turn, then stayed on
 into the lane, but got outfinished late. WILLY I AM raced far back, shifted to the six path into the lane, and was no factor.

 Footnotes
 READY TO TAP cleared exiting the first turn under a tight hold, widened her margin in hand into the far turn, was driven in upper stretch, and held sway
 while being geared down approaching the wire. GRAMS REVENGE settled far off the pace while four wide around the first turn, gained to a striking position
 passing the half mile pole and into the turn, but hung on her left lead into the lane, finally switched leads at the furlong pole and subsequently quickened to
 just get up for place at the wire. SHE'S FLASHY vied along the inside through the first turn, but got outpaced exiting the turn and stalked from the two path
 down the backstretch, chased the leader through the far turn, but proved no match for her into the lane, dug in between horses for place in deep stretch, but
 got nipped for the spot when the rider stopped driving approaching the wire. MARINE CORPS settled far off the pace while three wide and between foes
 around the first turn, gained simultaneously with GRAMS REVENGE down the backstretch and made an advance inside of rivals around the far turn, then
 dug in for place along the fence in midstretch, but got outfinished in the final sixteenth. ORBIT THE MOON vied for the lead while two wide and between
 horses around the first turn, got outpaced and stalked down the backstretch, then weakened further into the far turn and faded around it. FRIED ONIONS
 raced in midpack while two wide and between horses down the backstretch, but faded passing the half mile pole and never factored. OXBOW'S RUBY race
 far off the pace while saving along the inside, and was never involved. HERMIA hesitated at the start, trailed by a distance throughout, and showed little.

 Footnotes
 PATTI GO GIRL set the pace from the two path in the early stages, cleared and manuevered to the rail into the turn before getting headed by QUEEN CITY
 KITTY at the three furlong pole, held her rail position through the bend and rebid along the inside into the lane, fought on and dug in gamely in upper stretch
 as TIZ STELLA struck the front at the furlong pole, then prevailed in the stretch duel to the wire. TIZ STELLA settled far off the pace and outside of rivals,
 advanced in hand from the four, then the three, path around the turn and made a bold bid for the lead in upper stretch, forged a slight advantage at the
 furlong marker from PATTI GO GIRL, but got outfinished by that one in a game stretch duel. MAYBETHEDAY was slammed between horses and squeezed
 back at the start, trailed the field to the half mile pole, made a strong and menacing four to five wide rally outside of rivals around the turn, but flattened out
 at the quarter pole, got outkicked by the top pair passing the furlong pole, and stayed on for show in the late stages. QUEEN CITY KITTY stalked the pace
 setters from up close in the three path, bid and grabbed the lead into the turn, held the advantage until upper stretch, but got outkicked between rivals at the
 furlong pole and weakened late. HOTTLILNUMBER tracked the pace from the two path, but faded passing the half mile pole, swung to the four path into the
 lane while still far off the pace, then passed tired rivals. SWING MUSIC vied along the inside, but got outpaced and faded passing the seven-sixteenths
 pole, then regressed further around the turn before passing a tired foe in the lane. STAR OF PRIDE stalked from the three path around the turn, but was
 outpaced approaching the quarter pole, drifted in to the rail in upper stretch, then stopped. BANKER'S BIT was bumped at the start and outsprinted in the
 early stages while two wide and between horses, trailed into the lane, and was no factor. GIFT FROM MOM broke out and bumped a foe at the start, pulled
 inside to gain midpack position by the half mile pole, but faltered into the turn and stopped in the lane.
