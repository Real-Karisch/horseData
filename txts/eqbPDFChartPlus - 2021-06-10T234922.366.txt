 TIME ON TARGET established the front shortly after the start and crossed to show the way in hand inside through the first turn before taking to the two path
 down the backstretch, settled into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits awaiting a challenge, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got let
 out spinning just off the inside for home, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, held sway kept to task. UNLEVERAGED three to four wide through
 the opening bend, settled four then three wide in mid pack, came under coaxing coming in very slightly and put both CURLIN'S NEW MOON and BIG
 AGENDA in tight to the inside, swung four wide for home, rallied angling in a path inside the eighth pole and kicked on belatedly to garner the place honors.
 MATHEMATICIAN three then two wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and was leaned on by
 CAUSEUR straightened away and denied the move pushing that rival to the inside and taking to the two path, jostled with that foe getting bumped out a
 path a furlong out, then ran on to secure the show honors. CAUSEUR tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
 just off the inside for home and attempted to lean his way out to the three path when denied the move by the aforementioned foe getting nudged to the
 inside straightened away, angled out once more and bumped his way out a path at the eighth pole, then was outkicked to the finish. POWER BOSS just off
 the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but was outfinished in the late
 stages. AMERICAN LINCOLN three to four wide near the rear, tipped out five wide put to coaxing three furlongs from home, continued five wide into upper
 stretch and was outkicked. WICKED TRICK four wide through the first turn, raced four wide in pursuit coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths, continued

 pecking the ground, raced four then three wide in the clear just off the pace, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper
 stretch and weakened in the late stages. BIG AGENDA forced to steady off heels shortly after the start leaving the chute, saved ground in pursuit from near
 the rear, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths and was forced to steady put in tight along the rail as CURLIN'S NEW MOON and
 UNLEVERAGED briefly jockeyed for position at that station, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind foes and offered no response. CURLIN'S NEW
 MOON three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, moved through a tight seam at that station
 and paused very briefly jostling for position momentarily with UNLEVERAGED as that foe went by, swung three wide into upper stretch and came up empty.
 DESERT STONE (IRE) pinched back after the start due to pressure from BIG AGENDA inside and pressure outside, saved ground near the rear, came
 under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and made no impact. FACTOR THIS three to four wide through the first turn, had the saddle
 slip through the first turn and was guided well outside, was eased and accompanied off my outrider.
