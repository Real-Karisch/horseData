 FEVERED AFFAIR settled inside, steadied behind the leaders while trying to rally nearing the stretch, swung to the outside in early stretch then quickly drew
 off in hand. TRI TRY COLORS made the pace along the rail to early stretch then was no match for the winner while clearly second best. JONES TAXI led
 the early chase, gave his best two wide outside the early leader into the far turn then had nothing left for the drive. CLEAVE trailed into the final furlong then
 passed tired ones. OFFLEE ALEX was unhurried outside, began a run after a half, moved closer into the far turn then flattened out. A HINT OF LIME was
 close up on the outside around the first turn then faded.
