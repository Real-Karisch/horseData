 EDDIE HASKELL stalked off the rail then between horses on the turn, came three deep into the stretch, bid three wide in midstretch and gamely prevailed
 under a late left handed crack of the whip and a strong hand ride. STORMY LIBERAL close up stalking the pace outside a rival, bid alongside the pacesetter
 on the turn, bobbled when taking an awkward step past the quarter pole, took a short a short lead and fought back under urging between foes in the stretch,
 had the rider lose the whip nearing the wire and continued gamely to the end. CALCULATOR had speed four wide then inched away, angled in and set the
 pace inside, fought back on the turn and through the stretch and could not quite match the top pair late. CISTRON saved ground stalking the pace, waited
 off heels into the stretch, came out for room in midstretch and was edged for third. TOUGH SUNDAY broke a bit slowly, chased off the rail then three deep

 handling late. COONEY stalked off the rail, inched forward on the turn, was not a match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. STAY IN YO

 chased outside a rival, dropped back on the turn, came out into the stretch and gave way.

 DANNIE JOE broke a bit slowly, saved ground stalking the pace, came out some in the stretch, bid between foes under urging a sixteenth out to gain a
 short lead in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. TIZ TOFFEE had good early speed and dueled between horses, stalked a bit off the rail then between foes
 on the turn, bid again three deep a sixteenth out and went willingly to the end. WINSINFASHION went up inside to press the pace, inched away on the turn,
 fought back some past midstretch and held third. LOVELY RAQUEL stalked outside the winner then a bit off the rail leaving the turn and into the stretch and
 lacked the needed rally. KINDRED prompted the pace between horses, stalked outside then three deep on the turn and into the stretch and weakened.
 CHAY UP AND AWAY forced the pace four wide between horses, stalked between foes on the turn, angled in entering the stretch and also weakened. WE
 ALL HAVE DREAMS pressed the pace five wide on the backstretch, stalked four wide on the turn, came three deep into the stretch and had little left for the
 drive.

 Footnotes
 CAMINO DE ESTRELLA stalked off the rail, bid between horses then outside the pacesetter into the second turn, re-bid between horses under urging in
 deep stretch and gamely got up. GEORGIE HYPHEN (IRE) was rank along the inside and steadied early and again into the first turn, saved ground stalking
 the pace, steadied again into the second turn, came out in upper stretch, bid three wide in deep stretch and went gamely to the end. FRIENDLY STEVE
 angled in and set the pace inside, responded when challenged leaving the backstretch, inched away again just off the rail in the stretch, fought back in deep
 stretch and held third. MR. MAGICO chased outside a rival then a bit off the rail, angled to the inside in the stretch and was outfinished. TOPGALLANT
 chased inside then a bit off the rail on the second turn, angled in leaving the turn, came a bit off the fence in the stretch and was outkicked alongside a rival
 late. GRAY ADMIRAL in a bit tight early, chased inside then outside a rival, steadied to avoid the fallen rider leaving the backstretch, angled in entering the
 stretch and lacked a response in the drive. DIGNITAIRE stumbled at the start, chased three deep, dropped back outside a rival on the second turn and
 weakened. HOT AMERICAN angled in and chased a bit off the rail, took a bad step and suffered a catastrophic injury to the right front and unseated the
 rider leaving the backstretch and was vanned off. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident leaving the backstretch before ruling no other runner
 was responsible for the trouble to HOT AMERICAN.
