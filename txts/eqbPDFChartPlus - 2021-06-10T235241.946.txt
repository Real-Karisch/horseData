 FERDINANDTHEMOUSE settled off the early pacesetters, bid inside on the final turn and prevailed following a long drive. GRAMS HALO hustled to the
 front off the rail, vied most of the trip and held on gamely. CERTAIN SOMETHING advanced very wide on the final turn, loomed boldly near mid-stretch but
 flattened out. SKY BANSHEE lacked speed near the inside and proved empty in the stretch. ECLIPTICAL JACK broke a step slowly, rushed to contention
 then gave way. WEST SHORE DRIVE lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. DOMINICK'S DREAM was urged to duel inside and was finished by the
 far turn. HENNY STRIKE fanned wide on the first turn, raced close up briefly and faded.

 COURTAGE pursued the pacesetter outside, bid into the stretch and edged away under steady handling. ANNIKA GOLD controlled the pace inside, was
 collared into the stretch, battled back then weakened. CARAMEL CREAM trailed the opening quarter, split rivals rallying on the final turn but offered only a
 mild gain late. HELL OF AFIRE chased very wide off the pace and lacked a solid rally. LIL MISS HOTSHOT urged just off the pace four wide and was
 finished after half a mile. BILLY NO SABAY moved very wide on the first turn and was never a factor. STAY SPECIAL broke through the gate prior to the
 start, saved ground and gave way. BLONDIE GIRL was fanned extremely wide into the first turn and stopped abruptly.

 EVERY STEP, outrun racing wide, split rivals into stretch, eased out rallying and closed with a rush to get the nod. GORSUCH, between rivals early, raced
 three wide into stretch, came in slightly at the head of the stretch, began to inch clear in mid stretch and then just failed to last. OUTVOTED, in the three
 path while just off the pace, angled out through stretch and finished well. MESS'N WITH BUDDY three wide and just off the pace, split rivals in stretch and
 finished on even terms with WINDOW TABLE. WINDOW TABLE saved ground just off pace, was in a bit tight entering the stretch, came out under left
 handed pressure in deep stretch and finished in a dead heat with MESS'N WITH BUDDY. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF DOUBLE
 SKY, WINDOW TABLE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST. CONTROLLED FURY raced extremely wide and rallied too late. BENNYLUVSPOKER,
 in the three path, eased out racing into stretch, steadied off heels in mid stretch. SELLING OUT made a strong run around rivals on the final turn and into
 stretch, challenged but then flattened out. DOUBLE SKY racing in the three path, was between foes racing into the stretch, was in a bit tight in early stretch,
 took up in deep stretch.

 Footnotes
 LOVE IS ALL broke alertly and set the pace, repulsed a challenge, on the turn and moved clear. FREQUENTLY outrun early, advanced along the inside and
 closed well. HAVEANICEWEEKEND chased inside to the stretch, angled out and continued nicely to earn the show. HEARTY JONES settled off the pace
 outside and lacked a solid rally. IWISHIRISH lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn and into the stretch with a mild rally JUST LISTEN prompted the
 pace outside to the stretch and came up empty. RIO VISTA urged wide just off the pace and flattened out in the stretch. THEA'S REIGN trailed throughout
 and lost contact with her field.
