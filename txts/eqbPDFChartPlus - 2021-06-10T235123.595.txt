 Footnotes
 GET WESTERN set the pace early, was on the inside entering the lane then drew away late while ridden out to the finish. ALMOREB chased the pace
 early, shifted into the three path in the far turn while making a bid but was no match for the winner in the stretch run. PACKED HOUSE came in at the start,
 stalked the pace early, shifted into the three path in the far turn and weakened late in the stretch drive. TAKE NOTICE broke a bit awkward at the start and
 raced back early on, fanned into the five path in the far turn and moved up in the stretch. WELLES CROWTHER broke awkwardly and raced back early on,
 swung into the six path in the far turn and improved position in the stretch. DREAMOLOGY broke slowly and was bumped at the start, fanned into the five
 path in the far turn and improved position down the lane. RICKHOUSE was in tight and steadied early on. OVERZEALOUS was never a threat. JIMMY JOE
 shifted into the three path in the far turn and was empty late. BOLD FRIENDS came out at the start, tracked the pace early, angled off the rail in the far turn
 and was tired down the lane. EL CAPA ROJO was never involved. JUST LIKE RICHIE was through after a half.
