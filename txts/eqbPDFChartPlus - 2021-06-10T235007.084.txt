 Footnotes
 DON'T STALK ME chased outside, came four wide into the stretch, angled out in upper stretch, bid four wide, took the lead past the eighth pole, inched
 away and drifted in and proved best under a left handed crack of the whip and steady handling then a snug hold late. GRINGO STAR had speed between
 horses then stalked outside a rival, swung four wide into the stretch, bid between horses, also drifted in then angled in late. COLORMEMONEY pressed the
 pace between horses, put a head in front in midstretch, could not match the top pair late but held third. ISEE IT IN HISEYES prompted the pace three deep
 to the stretch, was between foes nearing midstretch and was outfinished. OUR TIGER'S BOY bobbled slightly at the start, chased outside then off the rail,
 came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SIR VALENTINE had good early speed and set a pressured pace inside, fought back in
 midstretch and weakened late. BOB'S ALL IN a step slow to begin, saved ground stalking the pace, came out a bit into the stretch and lacked the necessary
 late kick.

 Footnotes
 AFLEET ASCENT stalked outside a rival then off the rail, came out four wide into the stretch, bid four wide in midstretch under urging then outside the
 runner-up in deep stretch and edged that one on the line. LITTLE JUANITO saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch bid between foes in
 midstretch to gain a short lead a sixteenth out, fought back inside the winner and was edged late. BRANDOTHEBARTENDER chased between horses then
 a bit off the rail, came out leaving the hill and four wide into the stretch and got up for the show. ERIC THE TROJAN settled a bit off the rail then inside, cut
 the corner into the stretch, came out past midstretch and split rivals in deep stretch to be edged for third. CALEXMAN dueled between horses then outside a
 rival, regained a short lead in the stretch, was between foes in midstretch and weakened late. ARTIE B GOOD three deep early, settled a bit off the rail then
 outside a rival leaving the hill, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. FLIP THE COIN JAN had good early speed and angled in, dueled
 inside, fought back in midstretch and weakened. DENMAN'S CALL saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and could not offer the
 necessary late kick. TULE FOG dueled three deep then stalked outside a rival leaving the hill, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. Rail on hill at
 zero.
