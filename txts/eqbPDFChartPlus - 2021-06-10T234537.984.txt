 PRIEST LAKE stalked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, pushed clear to mid stretch and held under steady urging. TIZ A DREAMER was
 outrun to the turn, bid two wide, eased three wide then swung out widest for the stretch run and finished in a rally. SHE'S A SPY broke a bit slow while
 bumping with FRISKY FOX, chased the pace from the rail to the stretch, finished a mild rally but was outkicked for second. FRISKY FOX also was away a
 bit slow after bumping with SHE'S A SPY, pushed up to get the lead, set the pace two wide to the stretch then was collared by the winner and weakened.
 DESERT ROYALE was green early off heels to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch but could not make an impact late. RUHAY had no speed, was forced
 out to the four path on the turn and gave out in the drive.

 to get the lead, set the pace from the rail to the stretch but was overtaken leaving mid stretch and tired. WALK ON WATER chased the pace two wide to the
 stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. LUCK LASTS pressed the pace to mid turn then was outrun to the stretch and gave out.

 outrun to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. DADDY'S MISTRESS pressed the pace to the
 half, offered a bid three wide on the second turn to briefly loom a threat into the stretch but finished evenly. SOMEDAY SPECIAL trailed to the second turn,
 was two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing bid. HI SKOOL SWEETHART tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then weakened. WHIFF OF

 the leader from the rail to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch then had enough of a cushion to hold second desperately. CATTERING broke a bit slow,
 was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch, shifted in for room in mid stretch and picked off rivals late to just miss the place. HANDFUL OF
 PEARLS hustled to the front, set the pace to the stretch from the rail but was collared by the winner and weakened. BOLT UP was outrun to the turn, came
 four wide to the stretch then could not make an impact in the drive. VICTORIOUSLY JEWEL had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch but
 lacked the needed late response. FULLBRIDLED JET was chasing to the turn then saved ground to no avail. HOLD MY HOOPS pressed the pace two wide
 to the stretch then tired.
