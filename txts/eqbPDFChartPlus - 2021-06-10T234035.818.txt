 CHELIOS broke slowly, was hustled up inside, moved out and rallied around leaders into stretch, took the lead deep stretch and won going away. FIFTY
 prompted the pace between foes, fell back in mid stretch, was no match for winner but came back for place. IMASUPERSTAR set the pace in the three
 path, drifted out while drawing clear but then weakened. NINETYEIGHTOCTANE, three wide early, raced very wide into stretch and gave way. ALGORIX,
 between rivals early, also swung very wide into stretch and tired. KING'S HOUSE, four wide in top flight, dropped back steadily. SEA SWAP broke slowly,
 saved ground and showed little. FLYING ROCKET, wide, showed nothing.

 D T GOODIE vied inside with a narrow lead, lost the advantage in the stretch but came again in the final sixteenth. FLASHY KYEM dueled outside, led into
 the stretch but was outfinished in a long battle. MY PIRATE broke slowly, rushed up in the two path and continued willingly. ESPRESSO CALIENTE saved
 ground off the leaders, moved wide in the stretch with a mild rally. GET THE W raced close up inside then began fading on the turn. FAST RUNNER lagged
 far behind then caught a tiring rival late. WILD ABOUT DEB chased within striking range outside and gave way.

 and came out leaving the brushing foe, set the pace in four path, opened a long lead mid stretch but couldn't hold on. THE RIGHT PATH steadied after the
 start, raced in four path early, split rivals in stretch and finished well. FIX ME A SANDWICH was brushed and jostled slightly leaving the gate, raced wide
 and faded. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE came in leaving the gate, raced in the five path chasing then tired. SCREEN SAVER was also jostled leaving the gate,
 raced wide early, moved in through the stretch and failed to menace. TOO MUCH JOHNNIE saved ground just off the pace then tired. STRICTLY THE
