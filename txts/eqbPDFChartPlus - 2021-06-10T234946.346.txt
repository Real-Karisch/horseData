 making no headway on the leader through the turn into upper stretch, stayed after it digging in from the three path to save place. SAY IT SWEETLY saved
 ground rallying on the inside in upper stretch showing best stride the final sixteenth. AMALFIA ISLAND was steadied leaving the gate, lagging through the
 turn would improve a bit in upper stretch outbidding the others. EASTERN PRIDE slow early raced six wide to upper stretch. LEMON SPARKLE was always
 outrun tiring in upper stretch. MAGIC SENSATION eased in mid stretch jogged to the wire walking off after the race.

 Footnotes
 MISS ALTAMIRA unhurried early saved ground to the far turn, circled out there advancing to grab the lead at mid track in upper stretch surging off the final
 sixteenth. SLIPPERY prompted the pace through the backside taking a narrow lead on the far turn, dueling in upper stretch angled out inside the eighth pole
 to meet the challenge of MISS ALTAMIRA proving no match for rival while holding as a clear second best. LIES AND SCANDALS away alertly set a
 pressured pace dueling on the inside through the far turn to upper stretch wearing down there near the rail. CAROLINE THE GREAT stalked the pace
 through the backside then weakened on the far turn racing evenly from the four path down the lane. RETURN TO DENIS played no factor. PAINTED
 ROCKET done early was eased to the wire.
