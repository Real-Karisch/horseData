 Footnotes
 TALK LESS unhurried early, responded with a burst of speed late out in the six path and got up in the final strides. MORE THAN GOOD away alertly,
 battled for the lead two wide around the clubhouse turn, edged clear before a half, widened on the second turn, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't
 handle the late charge of the winner. FRONTLINER allowed to settle, moved up in the five path on the second turn and finished with good courage.
 SEGOVIA closed a gap late in the six path. HARDLY HOME was no threat. DOUBLE SENCE was through after a half. DR GIVENS matched stride with the
 winner to that one's inside around the first turn, chased that one into the second turn then faltered.

 near the furlong marker then finished full of run to win as much the best. LINDA N MICHELLE sprinted to the lead before a quarter, set the pace until mid
 stretch then was no match for the winner. SILKY TASSELS had a mild late rally. MANDI'S PRIDE broke in front, stalked the pace three wide, loomed boldly
 nearing the quarter pole, was carried wide by the winner then came up empty. BIRDACIOUS inside, lacked the needed response. GIFT FROM MOM had
 brief speed. CIRCLE WILL RUN was outrun. JIGS A ROLLIN was no factor.

 Footnotes
 RIDE THE TIGER sprinted up between horses to make the lead before a quarter, set the balance of the pace and proved best under strong handling. BIG
 RED BROWN never far back, rallied determinedly in the seven path through the stretch and got up for second. A NICE RENDITION stalked the pace from
 the start, loomed boldly in the five path entering the stretch then was outfinished. DIVINE SONET unhurried early, finished well along the rail. BOLD
 SENATOR went evenly. UNION LABEL had speed along the inside into the stretch then faded. NO WAY R J failed to menace. JESSETHEMARINE passed
 tiring rivals in the six path. MUSICINTHEHOUSE was no factor. RED ABYSS broke in front, vied for the lead three wide into the turn then flattened out.
 WAKES WEEK was outrun. ROCKABYE had speed into the turn then faltered.
