 Footnotes
 SIMRAN tracked off and outside the first flight while under light prompting early to maintain striking distance, came under urging three wide racing into the
 bend to gain terms with the first flight nearing upper stretch, shifted out a bit entering the lane but edged forward late under firm right handed pressure to
 prove best. VIDIRA joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, dueled for command between foes on the turn to upper stretch but proved only second
 best in late stages. FIRSTMATE, unhurried along the inside in the opening stages, shifted off the inside nearing the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch
 while being prompted to advance and made a mild bid late to gain a share. HELEN'SPHOTOFLASH was urged to prompt the pace while angling inside the
 leaders in the opening quarter, was eased back racing into the turn, switched off the inside racing into upper stretch to bid between foes but was just
 outkicked for a share. CABLOOSIE BAY, urged to dispute the pace between foes in the opening stages, shifted to the inside pressing the issue into the turn,
 then gave way in the drive. DEVIL LADY, off slowly, proved no threat. THE RACE WAS DELAYED DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER.

 Footnotes
 MR. JAGERMEISTER broke out at the break brushing WATERTONIAN, moved forward to set the pace between foes, wrested command under his own
 courage nearing the seven sixteenths, widened his advantage while never being asked and won easily. SPEEDING KID was reserved on the inside in the
 early going, angled to the rail gaining ground through the turn, finished willingly in the lane and was second best. WATERTONIAN was away alertly from the
 gate, brushed by MR. JAGERMEISTER then showed brief speed three wide to challenge for the lead, failed to match strides with that rival, chased four
 wide through the turn, and finished evenly. WARRIOR BOSS was urged forward to press the pace on the inside and weakened in the lane. DIXIE BLUES
 settled off the pace and dropped out on the turn. THE RACE WAS DELAYED DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER.

 Footnotes
 SEYNATAWNEE, within striking distance tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid three deep racing into the far turn, moved
 to terms with OCTAVIA HILL in upper stretch and continued in a prolonged skirmish with that foe to wrest a narrow advantage in time under brisk left
 handed encouragement. The latter gained terms with a rival prompting that foe's pace into the backstretch, dueled for command between foes into the far
 turn, grudgingly resisted the winner's challenge along the rail through the stretch but proved only second best. MINNY O'PRADO was rated outside foes
 from just out of striking distance to the far turn, was urged to advance four wide approaching upper stretch but lacked the needed final response. FOXY
 FOOTNOTE bore out racing into the turn while dropping into last and never gained contention. TALKIN N TEXTIN, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals
 from the outset into the backstretch, gave way leaving the far turn. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

 Footnotes
 ACES HIGH was steadied shortly after the break heading into the first turn, shifted out, pressed the pace three wide along the backstretch, edged clear
 nearing the three sixteenths pole and prevailed. AIRLITE was away alertly, set the pace along the backstretch, battled with ACES HIGH to the furlong
 marker but failed to match strides late and was second best. CHARLIE WEBB was reserved on the inside through the half, swung four wide on the far turn
 and closed belatedly widest of all. GLACKEN'S GHOST pressed the pace three wide through the half and gave way on the far turn. ROCKET JOE
 COPPER tracked the pace between foes throughout and failed to menace in the lane. HOLIDAY MISCHIEF tracked the pace on the rail throughout and
 faltered in the lane.

 Footnotes
 CLASSY SHACKLES broke readily to dictate the pace on a narrow margin along the rail racing into the turn, edged forward under pressure nearing
 midstretch, then shifted out approaching the wire into the path of BLUE MOON BELLE while turning that rival back under left handed pressure. The latter
 gained a forward placing three deep attending the pace racing into the turn, continued to make steady progress into upper stretch, moved to challenge for
 command near the sixteenth marker but was steadied after taking an awkward step approaching the wire. OOGA OOGA MOOSKA settled into stride off the
 inside dropping well off the leaders, swung four wide racing into upper stretch and made some mild late progress. WILD DESIRE stumbled at the break, was
 quickly righted to prompt the pace between foes racing into the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. PANDORA SKY angled inwards a bit tracking off the
 first flight, shifted to the rail racing into the turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. GOLDEN THUNDER proved no factor.

 Footnotes
 ARIZONA bobbled at the start while breaking slowly, recovered to track off the first flight along the rail in the opening half, shifted out four wide nearing the
 far turn while being prompted to advance, continued three deep in a prolonged skirmish past midstretch and edged forward in time under firm
 encouragement. GO FOR MOONSHINE tracked just off the first flight three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced in that path after a half
 to press the issue between foes racing into the far turn, dueled for command between foes to late stages and was just outfinished. REAL LUTE, forwardly
 placed three deep in attendance to the pace racing to the backstretch, moved to the fore while angling to the inside midway through the backstretch,
 disputed the issue inside foes into the far turn to upper stretch and grudgingly resisted the top pair to the end. NO MO ITCH settled off the second flight
 racing to the far turn and made some belated progress five wide into the stretch. BATTLE ZONE, caught four, then five wide in second flight racing to the
 backstretch, was urged to make a brief bid three deep between foes racing into the far turn and came up empty nearing upper stretch. ALLLUVIAL FAN,
 urged to the fore while angling inside racing to the first turn, emptied out early. PLAY AT THE PLATE, forwardly placed between foes attending the pace to
 the backstretch, steadily faded after a half. PAID THE NOTE soon dropped out.

 Footnotes
 STRIKE HOME pressed the pace three wide, took over at the quarter pole, and drove clear. REVEREND DON tracked the pace three wide through the half,
 prompted heading into the far turn under steady right handed urging and flattened out in the lane. DOUBLE SIX DOMINO pressed the pace between foes
 and weakened in the lane. CAVA HOYOS was reserved between foes, angled three wide on the far turn and had no response. EXPECT THE MAN dropped
 back to settled three wide throughout and failed to menace in the stretch. JUST MO broke inward, settled inside and proved no factor. HES A JONESBORO
 was bumped at the start, hustled clear on the rail and stopped past the half.

 Footnotes
 CINCO STAR tracked the leaders unhurried three wide in second flight in the opening stages, made a sharp advance to contention in that path racing into
 the turn, angled inside the top pair when presented an opening nearing upper stretch to wrest the advantage and went clear late under pressure. FRENCH
 DANCER joined the pace four wide in the opening furlong, pressed the issue outside a rival into the turn while being fanned wide by that foe nearing upper
 strech but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. JERSEY BOB broke sharply, pressed the pace three wide between foes into the turn,
 continued to duel inside a rival racing well off the rail on the bend and gave way in the drive. WHATDOYATHINK flashed pace between foes forcing the
 issue in the opening stages, dropped back entering the turn, swung out four wide into upper stretch and gained some position while failing to seriously
 menace. JAZZ LOVERMAN, urged inside rivals prompting the pace racing to the bend, gave way entering the turn. GO ON DANGEROUS tracked the
 leaders inside foes in second flight but offered no rally. ENGLISH RANSOM proved no factor. SINK THE BISMARCK appeared to clip heels just after the
 start while dropping off rivals and never menaced thereafter.
