 SOUPER FLY OVER raced in midpack, closed three to five-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch and drove to the lead then just held. CARDINAL SIN was in
 midpack early under strong restraint, angled three to six-wide through the turn, rallied widest and just missed. LEO FROM HEAVEN led early, moved clear
 through the turn, was headed a furlong out and chased gamely to the end. SNICKER showed brief speed then stalked the pace, raced two to four-wide on
 the turn then finished evenly. GAMBLE'S CITIZEN settled off the pace, closed to midpack on the backstretch, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn,
 moved back to the rail midstretch and finished under a determined drive. MAGICAL MAN forced the pace early, chased three to four-wide late turn but
 evened out in the final furlong. LOVE IN THE FOREST stalked the pace, came through the turn on the rail then two-wide, was hustled upper stretch but
 evened out in the final 16th. GASCONADE raced off the pace, came four and five-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. PERLARANA settled off
 the pace, trailed two-wide into the stretch but failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 BE VEWY VEWY QUIET was near the back on the outside early, advanced into midpack midway down the backstretch, commenced a rally on the turn
 racing four-wide, reached the lead in midstretch, drifted outwards, made contact with SILENT STING deep in the stretch and just held that foe at bay.
 SILENT STING bobbled at the start, raced in midpack early, ended up near the back heading into the turn where he raced three-wide, began to close in the
 stretch, had to switch to the outside at the 1/8th pole to continue his bid, was herded outwards by BE VEWY VEWY QUIET, took a minor bump from that foe
 nearing the wire and just missed. ROYAL LASER was bumped by BEER PRESSURE at the start, raced near the back early, trailed the field on the turn
 where he raced two-wide, ducked inwards at the top of the stretch, angled outwards a furlong out and closed with a rush. BEER PRESSURE bumped into
 ROYAL LASER at the start, pressed the pacesetter, raced two-wide on the turn, made the lead in early stretch and gave way grudgingly. SMOOTH TALK
 showed speed, stalked the leader while racing on the outside, was three-wide on the turn, remained in contention at the top of the stretch and chased to the
 wire. HANDSOME LIKE ME raced in midpack, was two-wide on the turn, launched a bid in midstretch but evened out in the final 1/16th. CAT'S WHISPER
 stalked the pace while racing on the inside, saved ground on the turn and tired in the stretch. SHERIFF CLARKE trailed the field early, made an advance
 along the rail on the turn, lacked a path in early stretch and finished with mild late energy. JOSIE'S RIDDLE lacked early speed, raced four and five-wide on
 the turn and failed to threaten. INGE got out to set the pace, was pressed on the turn and faltered down the stretch.

 furlong. PIERRE MINCE, close early, chased six-wide from midpack on the turn but lacked a closing response. SCARLET FORESTER stalked early, was
 also hustled four and five-wide from midpack on the turn but faded approaching the top of the stretch. ALMOST ROYALTY, well back early, was hustled
 along the rail on the turn but never reached contention. ONE POUND STERLING broke outward, sprinted up to lead on the main track, was headed at the
 turn and faded.
