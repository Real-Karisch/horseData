 Footnotes
 TACKETT prompted the pace on the outside while in the three path, took the lead near the three-sixteenths, battled gamely in the stretch and prevailed
 under strong urging. BUDRO TALKING went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the four path, bumped with a
 rival outside the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner in the final furlong and finished with good courage to get the place. STAR OF KODIAK raced in the
 two path on the first turn, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead near the
 three-sixteenths, fought on with the winner into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while just able to get the show. CADE'S ON THE BUMP went four
 wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, rounded the far turn in the five path, was roused at the quarter-pole, bumped with a rival outside the
 three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and was also outfinished but willingly earned the last spot in the superfecta. HIERARCHY saved ground on the
 first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and finished with late energy but missed
 the superfecta. KEEP QUIET (FR) angled in on the initial straightaway, steadied briefly while a bit keen nearing the first turn, was rated just off the pace on
 the inside, drafted along the rail on the far turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, checked against the rail around the three-sixteenths, was
 stymied while blocked behind horses in the final furlong and lost all chance in a brutal trip. MORNING STRIDE went around the first turn in the two path,
 settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, chased the vanguard in the drive and was out-kicked.
 BROTH rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and
 lacked the needed response. KITTEN'S BOY settled on the inside, came under a drive in upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker and failed to
 rally. BLUE HARBOR went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went four wide on the far turn, was carried seven wide into upper stretch
 and failed to threaten. (Rail at 8 Feet)

 DICKINSON'S IMAGE set the pace while inside to the two path, responded well in the stretch and prevailed under strong urging. EXPECT ICE was fractious
 in the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the front, chased four then three wide on the far turn, made a bid near the quarter-pole, battled
 with the winner in the stretch and missed while clear for the place. MR. BIG CITY was rated near the inside, saved ground on the far turn, was asked
 nearing the quarter-pole, chased into upper stretch and weakened while able to get the show. TAP KING was off slow and spotted the front a couple of
 lengths, raced in the two path on the first turn, settled near the back, moved up with a half-mile to run, was urged along while six then five wide on the far
 turn and came up empty. CRATUS went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while five wide early on the far turn then dropped to
 three wide and lacked the needed response. MISTER went two to three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was urged along in the three
 path on the far turn and tired. TERPS saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide for most of the far turn then
 shifted five wide, floated seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond. TORNADO BOY steadied while four to five wide on the first turn, advanced
 midway down the backstretch, was urged along while three then two wide on the far turn and had nothing left. ENUMCLAW bumped with a rival at the start,
 went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, moved out while dropping back on the far turn and faltered.
 MONEYINMYPOCKET was in tight nearing the first turn, moved out four wide midway through that bend, settled off the pace, was urged along while
 dropping from seven to five wide on the far turn and also faltered. MESSED UP was taken up after the start, went four wide on the turns and was no factor.
 HEAVY TRAFFIC bumped with a foe at the start, moved from three to five wide on the first turn, lagged at the rear, raced five wide early on the far turn then
 dropped to the rail and showed little. THE FINAL TIME WAS ADJUSTED FROM THE TIME ON VIDEO BUT WAS COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

 Footnotes
 BIBLEMAN disputed the pace, moved clear leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, responded well in the stretch and proved much
 the best under steady urging. ALTERANA bumped hard with a rival at the start, disputed the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased inside on
 the turn and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. KAI BABY KAI was urged along in the back half of the field, went four wide on the turn,
 came six wide into the stretch and was along for the show. SIR POKERFACE was last away, raced well back in the field, went around the turn in the two
 path and improved position without threatening. DRILLING REPORT dropped back while lugging out late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn,
 spun seven wide into the stretch and came up empty. SYDSTER was reluctant to load, brushed with a foe at the start, chased the pace on the outside then
 five wide on the turn and tired. TOTALLY ADDICTED settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the turn, dropped to three wide into the
 stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths then again in the vicinity of the furlong marker and failed to threaten. TIME TO ROME bumped hard with a rival
 at the start, raced at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. JAX MAN chased the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn,
 floated five wide into the stretch and faltered. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU broke in at the start, raced just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
 raced in the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and had nothing left. IN A BIND broke in at the start, chased the pace, dropped back
 leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, was carried six wide into the stretch and capitulated. GENTILLY STAGE brushed with a foe at the start,
 contested the pace, chased four then three wide on the turn and retreated.
