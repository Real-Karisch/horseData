 Footnotes
 STEVEN DECATUR broke in stride and set all of the pace from the inside, responded once in the stretch and extended his advantage driving. COULD BE
 THE ONE broke cleanly but quickly fell back, raced two wide on the turn and found his best stride too late. BRONCO BROWN chased the winner two wide
 into the stretch then lacked a closing response. JUST HITCHED settled early, raced three wide on the turn and failed to respond. THE FLIER BAILEY raced
 up inside into the turn, steadied sharply prior to the three eighths and fell back. VINTASTIC stalked early, fell back into the turn, steadied sharply prior to the
 three eighths and dropped from contention.

 Footnotes
 BULKAN gained a clear lead into the first turn and set the pace in hand from off the rail, responded in the upper stretch and extended his advantage while
 not being asked for his best. AMERICAN RHIANNON raced close up from the rail to the stretch but lacked the needed response. FRANKIE was well placed
 three wide to the stretch but failed to rally. CORAZON DEL FUEGO was unhurried early from off the rail, tried to rally three wide on the second turn but
 came up empty. DIAMOND STYLE saved ground early while settling, raced three wide on the second turn but was never a serious factor. MONARCA'S
 JOURNEY lagged early from the rail, raced just off the rail on the second turn but showed little. MUSIC AND ART settled early then fell back from the inside.

 MANITOU was never too far back from the outside, commenced his bid three wide on the second turn, took command two wide in the upper stretch and
 gradually edged clear driving. MONSAJEM PERVADE was unhurried from the rail early, followed the winner into the lane, loomed a bold factor a furlong out
 but lost his punch. WEST COAST INDY lagged early, was two wide to the stretch but could only go evenly late. MACAU took command once on the
 backstretch and eventually crossed to the rail, led to the second turn and gave way from the inside once in the stretch. PEPPER MAGIC led into the first
 turn, eased outside the leader and slipped back slightly on the backstretch then had little left for the drive. UNCLE KIMO saved ground to no avail.

 PAPA KADE set all of the pace from just off the rail, responded in the upper stretch and SHEILA'S FOOTSTEPS at bay late. SHEILA'S FOOTSTEPS (GB)
 raced unhurried early from the three path, was forced to circle four wide on the second turn and made only a minor impact in the final furlong. NAHEM
 stalked from the rail, slipped back slightly on the second turn, remained inside for the drive and went evenly. VOLKONSKY settled early, raced three wide
 on both turns and failed to rally. JACK THE CLOSER stalked three wide to the stretch and came up empty. ZORRITO was well placed two wide for six
 furlongs and did not respond.

 RIBBON OF JEWELS was outrun early, raced behind a wall of horses into the turn, swung four wide to rally into the stretch and finished steadily. PALACE
 GHOST was unhurried early and in heavy traffic into the turn, moved up inside to the quarter pole, split foes into the lane to loom a bold factor but was
 outfinished. MISTICAL MELODY settled early, was also caught in heavy traffic on the turn and finished in a mild rally. IRENIE set the pace off the rail and
 weakened. MYSTERIOUSMAGICIAN pressed the pace from the rail and came up empty. SWEET NINA settled early, was forced wide into the turn and
 gave way four wide. REVA BELLA pressed the pace three wide and gave out.

 SILVER JESTER stalked the pacemaker from the three path, forged to the front in the upper stretch and held driving. LUCKY LUCCIANA lagged early, was
 forced four wide to the stretch, loomed boldly at the furlong pole then was outfinished. HOUSE OF CHANCE stalked early from the rail, was shuffled back
 on the turn, swung three wide and came on again. TRENTO'S HEART settled early, rallied four wide into the stretch, led briefly a furlong out and flattened
 out. BUNKER BUSTER sprinted clear in the opening strides to set the pace from off the rail to the stretch, then had little left. SMOKED TOO MANY stalked
 the pace from the two path and weakened on the turn. SPIKES HIGH lacked early speed, was fanned four wide on the turn and failed to be a factor. UNION
 WINE saved ground to no avail.

 Footnotes
 RENO JOHNNY took command into the first turn to set all of the pace, held a clear advantage entering the lane, raced erratically through the final sixteenth
 and held driving. KALUHLA chased the winner two wide throughout, was forced to check and shift out in the late stretch but could make no impact against
 the winner. ZORISTO settled early four wide, circled five wide on the second turn and came on for the show. PEPPER SINGS lagged early two wide, raced
 three wide on the second turn but lacked the needed response. GRITS AND GUTS came off the rail early and stalked three wide on the first turn, was four
 wide on the second turn and faded. MOOKIE'S WISH lagged, raced three wide to the stretch and was not a factor. CEDAR RAPIDS showed little. SHEER
 PRINCE stalked from the rail but was through after six furlongs. THORNY ISSUE was never a factor. The stewards posted the inquiry and reviewed the
 stretch run of RENO JOURNEY and KALUHLA. While acknowledging that KALUHLA had to checked twice in the lane, they ruled that it did not affect the
 outcome.
