 Footnotes
 SOUTHERNPERFECTION, prominent from the outset, closed outside rivals and gained the lead in midstretch to win going away. SADIE'S MAGIC moved
 up between rivals leaving the turn, angled out over heels in upper stretch and finished well. TURNING THE TABLE was outrun to the stretch then rallied
 mildly outside for third. BENEVOLENT GIFT saved ground showing the way for a half mile then weakened. HIDEAWAY bobbled at the start then lacked a
 rally. SHEZA SUPER STAR collared the pacesetter at the top of the stretch then weakened in the drive. EASY LANDING tired. LIL POM POM pressed the
 early pace and tired.

 UPLIFTING raced two wide just outside INDIAN LOVER, engaged leaving the turn for the stretch drive then dueled to the wire and proved narrowly best.
 INDIAN LOVER broke sharp, saved ground setting the pace and fought it out gamely to just miss. MAI TY ONE ON raced just outside the top two drifted a
 bit wide at the top of the stretch and faded. SOUND OFF was going well at the end to best the others. UNION BLUES lacked a rally. TIPU RUN didn't break
 alertly then was outrun.

 Footnotes
 GHOST HUNTER was well placed racing close up along the inside and rallied into the stretch then closed with good energy to get up in the late stages.
 RING WEEKEND was unhurried early, came four wide around the far turn to gain the lead then wasn't quite good enough for the winner and was caught
 late. BERN' JAMES BERN broke alertly to set the pace then was not quite good enough late. CHIROPRACTOR, unhurried early, worked his way in traffic in
 midstretch and finished gamely. MARENGO ROAD raced within striking distance and responded well in the drive. POSTULATION prompted the pace then
 lacked the needed rally. GO AROUND engaged for the lead two wide on the far turn then was pinched off in tight quarters in upper stretch. DOMO
 ARTIEGATO lacked a rally. A claim of foul by the rider of GO AROUND against the winner for interference in the stretch was not allowed following a
 stewards inquiry.
