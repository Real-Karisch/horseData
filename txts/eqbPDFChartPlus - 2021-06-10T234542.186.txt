 Footnotes
 SHOW BIZ rushed from outset to gain immediate command and widened margin while finishing in hand. FREEZE LINE trekked as the outer most of four
 foes through the bend and into the stretch while rating in the second flight then closed the gap on the eventual winner in final furlong. FINE MATE settled
 into mid pack through the opening half before improving position in closing stages. MOON UNIT saved ground to no avail. TEXAS WARRIOR broke alertly
 and led the second flight along the backstretch then gave way to rivals after turning for home. SMART LEASE pressed the pace through the first call and
 was unable to sustain the bid in latter portion of contest. MEGA DA VIRADA gave chase from a reserved stance and failed to make headway in closing
 strides. TACTICAL SPORT trailed the field early and passed tiring foes in final furlong. WHAYNAUTBRUNNIN rated back into and through the turn before
 tiring in the homestretch.

 Footnotes
 ISTAN WARRIOR hustled from outset to gain immediate command from a ground saving stance and steadily pulled away from field to finish well clear of
 others. KASHEARS was slow into stride through opening turn, showed reserve along the backstretch then closed with a rush to earn the place. SEXY DEXY
 rated back through the opening bend, advanced position with a middle move then was nipped at wire for place by the late charge from KASHEARS. LAST I
 KNEW rated off the heels of pacesetter and eventual winner through the first call but was unable to match strides with top three rivals in closing strides. HEY
 RALPHIE BOY saved ground from a mid pack stance and lacked a rally when under urging in the homestretch. JIMBO'S BIZ chased the pacesetter from
 along the rail then weakened in crucial stages. CHA CHA NOW Y'ALL trekked the two path through the first bend, was well rated along the backstretch then
 tired in closing eighth. CROWNED LEADER settled between rivals but failed to make a closing bid. NORTHCOUNTY STROLL lost ground to frontrunners
 with a wide trip. ARCH SEEKER failed to menace. MASTER CAT trailed the field from a three path pose.

 Footnotes
 MORO TEXAS rushed from outset to gain immediate command and drew away from field for a clear victory. EUROWEST hustled from outset to assume a
 two path stance, held that pose through the turn and into homestretch but was no match for runaway winner. RAISON D'HEAT settled into the second flight
 and trekked between rivals through the bend then finished willingly to prove best of the rest. MIKE BAYES was well rated along the backstretch along the
 inside and maintained that pose into the stretch but lost the nod at wire for the show. HOLD THE MIC lacked a closing rally after giving chase to speedy
 pacesetters. RISKY BOY showed reserve early and steadily improved position. PENNYBACKER BRIDGE failed to threaten from a wide stance. ST
 JOSEPH COUNTY was well rated along the backstretch then lost ground to leaders by travelling four wide into the stretch and faded in final furlong. BIZ
 OPS stalked the pace from the three path, entered the stretch three wide and eclipsed in crucial strides. COUNTYCOURTHOUSE failed to menace. DOC'S
 MESCALERO lacked experience. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN trailed from outset.

 Footnotes
 LITTLE CODE stalked the pacesetter from along the rail then angled out near the quarter pole and kicked clear of rivals in final furlong. ROYAL ROAD
 loomed in the two path through the opening turn, was three wide at upper stretch then gained command briefly before being outkicked by eventual winner.
 SAGE'S EPIPHANY rated back in the opening half before slipping through along the rail and weaving traffic inside the quarter pole to earn the show.
 IMSORTASPECIAL hustled from outset to gain early command, led the field into the stretch then was overtaken by the late charging rivals. FLYIN FALYNN
 was unhurried for the opening half but improved placing with late interest. MIGHTY FERRARI was well rated along the inside then weakened in the closing
 stages. HOLDTHATLOVE faded rapidly from a three path pose after looming on the pacesetter through the opening half. ZELLA ROSE travelled widest of
 all and lost ground to front runners.

 ARCH CAT trekked along the inside in a tightly bunched group of rivals then circled the leaders near the three sixteenths pole and kicked clear in final
 furlong. AWESOME EMMIT hustled away from outset to exchange command along the backstretch and through the turn then was outkicked by eventual
 winner. WILD CARAMELO set the pace as the inner most of three rivals but was unable to fend off the top pair in closing strides. FLASHY INDIAN rushed
 from outset to share command through the opening half as the outer most foe of three and maintained that pose throughout but lacked any response to the
 urging inside the quarter pole. BAJAN CASH trailed the field until the top of the stretch then had a late gain to improve placing. ARCHIE came away
 amongst the tightly bunched group of rivals then finished evenly. HE'S A RANGER settled between foes and loomed a threat through the bend but was
 unable to muster a rally in the homestretch. STAR'S VALENTINO rated back through the first call then advanced with a middle move before weakening in
 the closing stages. SUSPECT A STORM lost ground to front runners with a three path trip. FROM OUT THERE travelled widest into the turn and was no
 threat. MINEFIELD flashed early speed and pressed the pace at first call before fading fast in latter portion of contest.

 Footnotes
 MR. WHITE came away the fastest to gain immediate command then never relished command and drew off from field under little urging. TOSEEKORNOT
 TOSEEK shown reserve early and trekked the four path into the stretch then finished strongly to earn the place. MCKLINTOK was well rated three wide into
 and through the turn then was outfinished in final furlong by top pair. AT IT EARLY made a ground saving trip and was within striking distance at top of lane
 but lacked any response to urging. MAGNETO travelled wide into the turn and weakened in the closing strides. MR MURPH saved ground to no avail.
 MAJESTIC THUNDER trailed the field from outset and passed tiring foe in homestretch. ICON'S SONG steadily faded from a two path pose. DEFENDER
 OF HEARTS stumbled at break and lost rider.

 Footnotes
 HEAT FLASH awaited options from outset then came under early urging and circled rivals through final turn and shook off rivals inside the eight pole to hold
 on for the win. PICKNNGRINN was unhurried through the opening half then swung wide entering the homestretch and was gaining on the leader at the
 finish while rallying mid track. HUMOR chased the early pacesetters from a two path stance then tucked to inside and rallied along the rail for the show.
 SUNLIT SONG lost ground to leaders by travelling four wide through the first turn and three wide through the closing bend before rallying mildly to earn the
 bottom of the superfecta. WHERE'S JORDAN trailed the field early and improved position with late gain. ST. BIRETTA loomed in the shadows of the early
 pacesetters from a two path pose but was unable to match strides with rallying foes in final stages. REDATORY saved ground throughout and tired in
 closing stretch. GOT NO KASH passed tiring foes after trailing the field from outset. MONO faded rapidly after pressing the pace from between rivals.
 CHANNEL WON rushed from outset to lead the field through opening half before eclipsing inside the quarter pole.

 Footnotes
 RISQUEY BIDNESS shared early command from a two path stance then kicked clear in closing strides. SHELL LOCKET showed reserve along the
 backstretch then angled out and finished with the strongest late strides to earn the place. CHLOE CREEK settled into mid pack early then weaved traffic
 inside the quarter pole and finished along the rail for the show. FUN FACTS stalked the pacesetters into and around the bend from a two path stance but
 was unable to produce a closing kick to sustain the bid. SUNSET DREAMER lost ground to frontrunners with a wide trip. LIL MONEY trekked three wide
 into and through the turn before fading in the final stages. WIREWIREWIRE tucked behind early pacesetters to save ground then weakened in closing
 strides. LITTLE PAPOOSE improved placing with late interest. TINCURE CREEK steadily faded. SPORTS DANCER trailed from outset. OUR PINK
 CHAMPAGNE flashed early speed by gaining command at first call before being eased in final eighth.
