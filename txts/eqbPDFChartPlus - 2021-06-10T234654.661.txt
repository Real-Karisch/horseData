 GRAZEN HONOR raced and rallied very wide, drifted in slightly in deep stretch and got the nod. MSMISSIONCOMPLETE broke slowly, saved ground,
 came out a bit through deep stretch bumping with BOSOX PRIDE and held on for place. BOSOX PRIDE set the pace in the three pace, raced between foes
 in deep stretch, drifted in, contributing to the bumping with MSMISSIONCOMPLETE and gave way grudgingly. SCARFREE saved ground to near stretch,
 split foes then weakened. LUV HER BABY BLUES, well placed two wide, raced between rivals through stretch and tired. SMARTY PI, very wide, failed to
 menace. EMILYISAWESOME, well placed between foes, tired. RISQUE EXPRESS, wide, had only brief speed. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF
 BOSOX PRIDE AGAINST GRAZEN HONOR FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS DISMISSED.

 Footnotes
 TIGHTEN UP set the pace running in the seven path, remained very wide, and lasted under strong handling. COURT NOTE, in the four path early, split
 rivals on the far turn then moved inside, closed and just missed. MY COUSIN LOU broke slowly and awkwardly, raced three wide early, split rivals into
 stretch and finished well. SIGHT LINE steadied off heels soon after start then was steered to the rail, rider appeared to lose his balance briefly when
 steadying on the far turn, fell back but then was coming back late. RETROGRADE split rivals moving on the far turn, swung out but was no real threat.
 WILDCATPLEASURES, extremely wide chasing the pace, tired. BIG LIE failed to menace. ARRECIFE, very wide and just off the pace, tired badly. FIFTY
 EIGHT O G prompted from the five path then stopped.

 Footnotes
 ENCHANTABULL joined for command three wide near stretch, took the lead near mid stretch and drew off driving. FIREY CHILD vied for command
 between foes, was no match. WISE TRADE, between rivals early, was left with the rail then tired. SPICY DREAMER dueled for command just off the rail,
 tired and finished in a dead heat with TIMELY PLEASURE. The latter, saved ground while outrun, finished on even terms with SPICY DREAMER.
 MORNING WINE, bothered leaving the gate, raced wide on the turn and flattened out. FLOWERS FROM TONY came out sharply leaving the gate then
 raced raced wide. DOUBLE DOWN DONNA raced extremely wide into stretch in a dull try. POINT LOCKOUT broke slowly, saved ground then tired.
