 MALIBU AT MIDNIGHT moved to the inside early to set the pace in a lively manner then was good enough under steady pressure to hold off the challenge
 of JOSEY WALES. JOSEY WALES moved up along the inside into the stretch then steadily closed the gap. FAKE FRONTIER moved up around horses on
 the far turn to gain the show. GALLOWS BAY was forwardly placed from the outset then faded in the drive. MO BIG DEAL attended the early pace and
 tired. BANNON tired. AFLEET DOMINATION showed little.
