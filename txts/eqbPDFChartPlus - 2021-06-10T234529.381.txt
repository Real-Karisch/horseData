 ATLANTIC SUNRISE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held safely to the wire while
 under intermittent urging. DEGREES OF FREEDOM chased the winner while racing three-wide throughout, responded when set down for the drive and
 finished with good energy. RED HOT CHERRY raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for that drive, reached a
 contending position in mid-stretch but failed to gain late. SOPHIESHARDTOCATCH was forwardly placed from off the rail early, angled out approaching the
 stretch and finished evenly in the drive. LADY OF OPINION was forced out through the first turn, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second
 turn, angled out into the lane and did not threaten. MISS ARTIE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally.
 PERFECT ENGLISH was hustled along early, lugged out through both turns, dropped far back into the lane and was eased late.

 Footnotes
 OFF ON HOLIDAY settled just off the pace, ranged up in the three path on the turn, was bumped solidly by DUDE GREELEY at the five-sixteenths pole,
 made a bid at the quarter-pole, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive into the final furlong and held under strong urging. EIGHTS
 WILD settled under some urging, moved out late on the backstretch, was urged along while four wide on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch,
 drifted in some while on the inside lead approaching the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to get the place. DUDE GREELEY moved up while urged along
 on the inside, slipped into the two path entering the turn, came out some and bumped solidly with OFF ON HOLIDAY at the five-sixteenths, waited under
 restraint while blocked from that point until the three-sixteenths, came between horses shortly thereafter, dropped in under a right-handed whip at the
 furlong marker and finished with good courage to get the show. COTTON UP stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the two path on the
 turn, came in under a right-handed whip and bumped with SUMMER SINGER outside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and
 weakened. SUMMER SINGER showed good speed, set the pace, came under urging along the rail while under attack on the turn, turned into the stretch
 under the whip, bumped with COTTON UP outside the three-sixteenths, was in tight while dropping back at the furlong marker and tired. TUNDA CRASH
 ME broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, bumped with ELI'S HONEY late on the backstretch, entered the turn in the five path, dropped to the rail
 under the whip at the three-eighths pole, saved ground from that point into the stretch and was no factor. ELI'S HONEY broke a step slow, settled on the
 outside, bumped with TUNDA CRASH ME late on the backstretch, was caught six wide early on the turn then dropped to the four path, moved to the three
 path late on that bend and failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 UNEVEN STEVEN settled on the inside, moved to the two path while chasing midway through the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, was put to a
 left-handed whip at the three-sixteenths, angled out while in pursuit of the leader entering the final furlong, switched to a right-handed whip at the
 sixteenth-pole, gained on the fatigued runner-up late and got up at the wire. KATE'S DANCER showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside, was
 asked at the quarter-pole, shook clear into the final furlong, remained clear into the final sixteenth, shortened stride badly late and was denied at the wire.
 RUNMAKER was well spotted just off the pace, made a bid between horses at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, came under a drive in
 upper stretch, lost touch with the runner-up into the final furlong and was outfinished while just able to get the show. IDOL MCARTNEYVALUE settled off the
 pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and finished with
 late energy to just miss the show. WAITINGALONGTIME bumped with a rival at the start, contested the pace on the outside while lugging out a bit, chased
 three to four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and tired. CONE OF SILENCE was ridden along near the back, went three wide early
 on the turn, moved to the five path before the five-sixteenths and failed to threaten. UNK'S RED MAN bumped with an opponent at the start, was forwardly
 placed on the outside, dropped back in the four path on the turn and came up empty. VILAIN TAUREAU broke out then was corrected by the rider, settled at
 the back on the outside, dropped in late on the backstretch, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the three path and was no factor.

 Footnotes
 SOUND DEFENCE came away in good order, darted quickly to the inside while speeding clear, controlled the action while in the two path to the rail on the
 turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, was given one crack of a right-handed whip nearing the sixteenth-pole then switched to a left-handed
 whip and held under strong urging. MAY FLOWERS settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the turn, moved out under a left-handed whip at
 the furlong marker, switched to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage to secure the place. WAR POPPY settled on
 the outside, was asked while three wide on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. FORT RALLY settled at
 the rear of the field, rounded the turn in the three path, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out at the three-sixteenths then was put to a left-handed whip
 and improved position to just miss the show. LOVE YOU BACK tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two to three path on the turn, was put to the
 whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. I HOPE YOU DANCE broke out then bumped with a rival, settled on the inside of DIVA'S RANSOM, was
 urged along in the two path on the turn, raced under a moderate hand ride in upper stretch, was asked for her best in the final furlong but lacked the needed
 response while picking up some ground. DIVA'S RANSOM stumbled at the start then was bumped, tossed her head under some restraint while outside on
 the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, floated five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LONG ROAD broke out a
 bit, settled on the inside, dropped back along the rail under urging on the turn and failed to respond. (Rail at 8 Feet)

 Footnotes
 FAIRWELL TAX BREAK was away alertly, set the pace, vied inside on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, dueled with ACTIVE RUNNER in upper
 stretch, shook clear into the final furlong, drew off under the whip into the final sixteenth then was held together while losing focus nearing the wire and was
 much the best. CHINAWOOD broke a half-step slow, was taken up while tossing her head midway down the backstretch, steadied while shuffled back
 behind JACKIE EMS PAL from the seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths, finally slipped through inside that rival near the five-sixteenths, angled three wide
 outside the quarter-pole, bumped with AUNT NELLIE while coming four wide into the stretch and earned the place in a rough trip. AUNT NELLIE settled off
 the pace, was urged along while three to four wide on the turn, bumped with CHINAWOOD while five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response
 while able to get the show. ACTIVE RUNNER broke a step slow, chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, made a bid in the two
 path at the quarter-pole, dueled with the winner in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. SAMMIE'S TOUCH was bumped at the
 start, chased the pace between horses, went two to three wide on the turn and tired. HOPETTE broke slow then quickly dropped back, fell well behind, went
 around the turn in the five path, came six wide into the stretch and showed little. JACKIE EMS PAL broke out and bumped with a rival, raced just off the
 pace while inside of two opponents, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged along while two to three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch
 and came up empty.

 first turn, settled in the middle of the spread-out field, advanced in the two path on the far turn, swung five wide while asked at the quarter-pole, dropped in
 under a right-handed whip at the three-sixteenths, chased the winner into the final furlong, gained gamely on that foe late and just missed. MCHENRY
 dropped to the rail early on the first turn, settled well back in the field, saved ground on the far turn, lacked room while caught behind BLINDSIDED BLUES

 the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. RED FERN went around the first turn in the four path, settled well back on the outside, moved closer

 point but had nothing left in the final furlong. PHAT CAT went two to three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer in the three path on the
 far turn, swung six wide while roused into the stretch, chased past the three-sixteenths then came up empty. J DUB raced inside on the first turn, tracked

 Footnotes
 IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT lacked early speed, raced in the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, checked while blocked from the
 three-sixteenths to just outside the furlong marker, found room at that point then quickly accelerated and closed with a rush to win going away. STORMIN
 AFLEET broke through the front of the gate prior to the start, showed speed on the inside then was taken back off the pace, steadied behind horses from
 the half-mile pole to near the three-eighths pole, went two then three wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place.
 GALAXY BUILDER moved up midway down the backstretch to dispute the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, kicked
 clear in upper stretch, remained clear under the whip into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while clear for the show. TOOTH showed good speed,
 disputed the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased inside on the turn and weakened. TIGERSTORM bumped with a rival at the start, was
 coaxed along just off the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, made a brief bid at the quarter-pole then tired. STREET HONOR bumped twice
 with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, shifted five wide at the quarter-pole, chased briefly under the
 whip then came up empty. JUST DUE was last away, chased the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and
 capitulated. RUN AWAY RALPH bumped with opponents on both sides at the start, chased the pace between horses then three wide on the turn and
 dropped out.

 Footnotes
 VOW OF SECRECY tracked the pace, made a bid between horses at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, came under a drive in upper
 stretch, dueled with OH NO PETRINO into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. OH NO PETRINO set the pace on the inside, vied along
 the rail on the turn, dueled with the winner into the final sixteenth then was outfinished while able to hold the place. LITTLE NORWEGIAN settled in the back
 half of the field, saved ground on the turn, was asked while swinging three wide into the stretch, dropped in under a drive outside the furlong marker and
 finished with good energy for the show. POCKET TIME settled off the pace, raced between horses leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the
 turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. SHE'S COAL FIRED was reserved on the
 outside, dropped back without any urging from the rider late on the backstretch, went four then three wide on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole,
 moved out in upper stretch and finished well but reached her best stride too late. MUZZ'EM broke a half-step slow, moved up on the outside under urging,
 made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied three wide on the turn, floated four wide into the stretch, dropped back under a drive at the three-sixteenths and
 tired. SPRING FORMAL settled in the middle of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. ABENA was
 urged along off the pace, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the four path, floated five wide into the stretch and lacked the
 needed response. JERRY N BO was coaxed along off the pace, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on the turn, was put to the whip in
 upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. PI broke a step slow, raced at the rear of the field, rounded the turn near the rail, swung six wide into
 the stretch and was no factor. JIMNPAULS LAST TOY settled under some urging, went three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
 failed to threaten. (Rail at 8 Feet)
