 Footnotes
 TITFORTAT set the pressured pace between horses, shook clear leaving the turn, held sway under steady urging. OLYMPIC SMOKE attended the pace off
 of the inside, came four wide to make her bid, continued on willingly but was unable to reach the winner. ROCKAROO was allowed to settle, came into the
 lane four wide, rallied between rivals and was along for the show. ARCHIE'S GIRL settled in hand, angled out six wide and loomed a danger entering the
 stretch, but flattened during the drive. MISIA SEKIGUCHI vied for the lead along the inside to the stretch and faded. CASH DANCE was allowed to settle,
 circled into the stretch six wide but went evenly. MUDDLE passed only the tiring ones. GRANTASTICA broke slow and was never a factor. LA JOLLA
 D'ORO contested the pace three wide through the turn and stopped. GALLANT LADY tucked in to save ground but lacked a response when called upon.

 Footnotes
 TIGER LISA opened clear to dictate terms, widened entering the stretch, and held sway under stern urging. SILVER EXCESS was unhurried into stride,
 came four wide, split horses and finished full of run. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES was hustled along on the inside while never far back, angled out to make her
 bid entering the stretch, but flattened and settled for the show. ON THE COME was unhurried into stride, circled six wide into the stretch, angled out further
 and improved position. MISS D IRISH was allowed to settle, angled in leaving the turn and finished with a mild gain. KIERAN STREET contended four wide
 to the stretch, but weakened between rivals and faded. URAWESOMEBLOSSOM was allowed to settle, looped into the stretch six wide to make a mild bid,
 but failed to sustain the drive. FLATOUT HAPPY chased off of the inside to the stretch and tired. LUNA MESA broke slow, lagged well back and was
 distanced through the stretch. ROSEMAR was always outrun and was distanced through the lane.

 Footnotes
 PROMISE OF SPRING opened clear to dictate terms, turned back the bid of UPSTAGE midway through the second turn, recleared entering the stretch and
 gamely led throughout. AWESTRUCK attended the pace four wide, came under a ride midway through the second turn, continued on well but was unable to
 bridge the gap. WHOLEHEARTED contended toward the inside, shifted out entering the stretch, churned on through the drive and was along for the show.
 UPSTAGE tracked two wide, moved up to engage the winner on the second turn, but weakened entering the stretch and gave way. HONOR RIDE broke in
 the air, was away behind her field, tucked in to save ground, moved into contention on backstretch, but tired leaving the second turn. TIZ MY LADY was
 allowed to settle four wide and failed to make headway. SHEZAPPEALING was never a factor. DRINKS ON BROADWAY pulled between horses, came up
 empty before going six furlongs and dropped out.

 PRETTY PERFECTION settled in hand, launched her bid circling four wide into the stretch, wore down DREAMIN and was up in the final yards. DREAMIN
 was away alertly, angled in to set the pace, fought on through a long drive but was unable to resist the winner. BARBARY HALL prompted the pace to the
 outside of DREAMIN to the stretch, dropped off of the lead between horses, altered course to the outside of PRETTY PERFECTION and came again. MISS
 NANCY was bumped early and allowed to settle, circled into the stretch five wide and was making up ground. JUSTA LADY attended the pace along the
 inside, shifted out but failed to make headway. CLAIRENATION settled toward the inside, but lacked a response when called upon.

 Footnotes
 KANTASTIC opened clear to set the pace, met the bid of ROUSSALKA leaving the turn, shook loose again into the stretch, drifted about in the drive, came
 out late and bumped ALMAFUERTE soundly nearing the wire and was all out to just last. ALMAFUERTE tracked four wide, launched her bid leaving the
 turn, was getting to the winner steadily, was bumped hard late when KANTASTIC came out and just missed. ROUSSALKA stalked the pace, moved up to
 engage the leader leaving the turn, but weakened between horses in the drive and was all out to just hold the show. FAST TRACK KATHERN was allowed
 to settle, circled into the stretch five wide and was making up ground. SHOTOGOODJUDGEMENT broke a step slow, moved up between foes, but faltered
 entering the stretch and faded. CAROLINA REAPER was allowed to settle three wide and went evenly. BELLA MOON was allowed to settle toward the
 inside and lacked a response when called upon. SMARTLY hesitated at the start, veered out and was away well behind her field, and passed only the tiring
 ones. BRILLIANT DESTINY showed little. QUEEN MAXINE was through early. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the run through the deep stretch,
 and following the review KANTASTIC was disqualified from first and placed second for coming out and bumping ALMAFUERTE nearing the wire.
