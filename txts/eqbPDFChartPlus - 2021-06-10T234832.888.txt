 Footnotes
 MELLO KISSES pressed from the start, raced three wide for most of the trip, put a head in front turning for home, dug in just holding on in a very determined
 effort. SERVED COLD well placed early on traveling off the rail, tracked a contested pace around the bend, came three to four wide under a drive entering
 the stretch, surged willingly at the wire narrowly missing in a game effort. RIFIFI rushed from the gate and vied in a three way battle soon after the start,
 dueled to deep stretch but came up a bit short in a good effort. BRIDGET MOLONEY broke sharply and angled to the rail, was soon headed by a pair of
 rivals, matched strides to mid stretch then weakened missing a minor share. SWEET SOUND raced just off a trio of duelers hugging the rail, was in tight
 and waited for room in upper stretch, angled out late under a drive but lacked needed kick. LUCKY PINOT raced well off the rail down the backside towards
 the rear, found stride in mid stretch racing between foes and finished with interest. RED LETTER taken in hand and trailed down the backside, mildly
 responded on the bend but failed to threaten. PRIDE OF WILKO tracked to the far turn racing mid track, roused on the bend but lacked rally and tired in the
 drive. GELATO GAL raced wide towards the rear early on, weakened under urging offering little.

 LIGHTLY DANCING settled towards the rear, angled out entering the stretch, came five wide in the final furlong and quickly drew off under aggressive
 handling. J Z'S DIVA rushed hard shortly after the start and vied in a three way duel, gained a slim lead in mid stretch, was no match for the winner but did
 hold on well late saving second place in a solid effort. OLD TOY stalked running three to four wide, almost drew even in mid stretch, was outfinished late to
 settle for third place in a willing manner. JUST A REAL CAT raced up close along the rail around the turn, angled out in deep stretch and improved placing.
 IMA TORNADO dueled abreast on the turn racing three wide, battled to deep stretch before tiring. CHARLIE'S ANGEL (FR) reared and broke outward,
 hustled up racing wide throughout, loomed at the quarter pole, flattened out mid stretch. S S MUCH ADO broke alertly and dueled to the quarter pole racing
 between foes, gave way mid stretch. LOVING CANDY was soon outrun, never factored.

 Footnotes
 SKY TIME NOW broke well taking the lead, dictated the tempo throughout, began to draw off traveling in the four path top of the stretch, won easily being
 ridden out. U. S. POINT stalked down the backside racing mid track, chased from mid turn, gained second place but never menaced the winner. EYE ON
 THE MONEY stalked to the far turn, gave chase from the quarter pole while dueling for second place, tired in the drive to settle for third best. CROSS MY
 HEART was taken in hand leaving the gate, lagged far behind early, roused from the half but failed to factor. NIAGARA BELLE raced evenly towards the
 rear, gave way leaving the quarter pole finishing well beaten.

 COLBYVILLE rushed a rail move taking the lead at the half, went clear on the bend and angled to mid track, raced in the four path turning for home, won
 easily being ridden out. TAKE A RISK raced in mid pack to the far turn running well off the rail, rallied into second place at the quarter pole, leveled off in the
 drive but held well saving second place. FINE rated early running towards the rear, swung out five wide making move in upper stretch, improved position
 settling on third best. SUN BROWN tracked to the far turn, hard ridden mid turn giving chase, lacked needed surge. GIMMEADRINK settled in mid pack,
 split rivals mid turn, failed to threaten finishing evenly. KAYLA'S KITTEN pressed the pace to the half, angled inside near the quarter pole, gave way mid
 stretch. SHARP JOHNNY was soon outrun, never involved. GOLDIES NUGGET led briefly, dueled at the half faded leaving the quarter pole, stopped in the
 drive finishing weary.
