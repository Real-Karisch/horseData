 Footnotes
 SILVER SPUN sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the wire. MAS
 MISCHIEF chased the winner while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. SILVERDOLLARDREAMS was bumped at the
 start, tracked the winner from the inside, hesitated for room at the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed closing response. MOSTA FLYIN settled off the
 leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. MY GOLDEN AURA lagged early, raced off the rail through the second turn and
 did not reach contention. FEE WAIVER raced off the pacesetters early, moved two then three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. APPEALING
 JAZZ raced off the leaders early, moved three then four-wide through the second turn, weakened after going a half and was eased late.

 Footnotes
 WAR EAGLE'S RETURN broke sharply to stalk the pace of LET'S GO BEN while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
 three-sixteenths marker and drew off through the lane while under steady encouragement. FUSAICHI FLAME raced unhurried early, saved ground through
 the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good energy to gain the place. RARE ART was fractious at the gate, chased the pace of LET'S GO BEN
 while racing two-wide, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished willingly. LET'S GO BEN sprinted clear at once, saved ground while
 setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. KUTUZOV was off about two lengths slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn,
 angled out further in mid-stretch and did not contend. TANZEN was off about three lengths slow, saved ground on the turn and lagged throughout.

 the backstretch, drafted in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, chased the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth, gained

 the seven-sixteenths, drafted in the three path on the far turn, dove in while roused at the top of the stretch, moved back out at the three-sixteenths, chased

 on the outside, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked at the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive at the three-sixteenths then dropped back
 inside of MAXIMUS BEAUTY and finished with good energy for the last spot in the superfecta. LIPSTICKONMYCOLLAR lugged out while four to five wide
 on the first turn, entered the back stretch keen under restraint, settled more kindly by the five-eighths pole, went three then four wide on the far turn, was
 asked at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. WHOLEHEARTED was hustled from the start, set the pace on the inside, came under some
 urging on the far turn, was asked for more while in the two path turning into the stretch, lost the lead at the three-sixteenths and gave way. MIGHTY NICE

 Footnotes
 PURGENALITY set the pace on the inside, was confronted on the far turn then asked at the quarter-pole, dueled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth
 and proved best under good handling. ABDAAR raced in the three then two path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the two
 path on the far turn, was asked while three wide into stretch, dueled with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place.
 TURN TO INCLUDE went three then two wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, came under very strong urging midway down the backstretch, rounded
 the far turn in the two path, moved out inside the furlong marker and got up for the show. ITSTHEBOURBONTALKN was in tight while trying to go between
 horses nearing the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was rated off the pace, came under urging while inside to the two path on the far turn and lacked
 the needed kick. HE'S ALL MINE lugged out while two then three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace, lugged out again while three then four wide
 on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch and came up empty. AZTEC SENSE broke out at the start, raced in the four path on the first turn, settled on
 the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

 RAPID RHYTHM was carried in early then urged along at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the five path, swung seven wide into the stretch,
 rallied on the far outside and closed strongly to get up in the final strides. WHEATFIELD pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the four to five path on the
 turn, took the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive until the final few strides but was denied while clear for the place. SIMPLE SURPRISE broke out and
 was last away, settled on the far outside while just off the pace, went around the turn in the five to six path, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased under a
 drive into the final furlong, loomed a threat at that point but was out-kicked while able to get the show. BLIP N' TH BYE drifted in early, was well placed just
 off the pace, raced in the three path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly to just miss the show.
 EQUATION settled off the pace, went around the turn in the four path, was roused while six wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong then flattened
 out and was vanned off after the race. BOOM BAM BING contested the early pace on the inside of opponents, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
 chased in the two path on the turn, pursued the runner-up under the whip into the final furlong then weakened. LOVABLE LYSS brushed the inside of the
 gate at the start, disputed the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. CLAIRENATION contested the
 pace between horses, vied along the rail on the turn, battled under a drive until near the furlong marker and gave way.

 Footnotes
 ANNOY was coaxed along towards the front, ranged up in the four path on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, kicked clear when set down in upper
 stretch, drew off under the whip into the final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. LITTLE FARMS LADY was well placed just off the pace,
 drafted inside on the turn, was asked in the two path turning into the stretch, chased the winner under a drive and secured the place. LILI'S IMAGE settled
 near the middle of the field, moved closer while four then five wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response while
 just able to get the show. LAINES HOWDY DOODY lacked early speed, rounded the turn in the three path, spun four wide into the stretch, dropped in while
 put to a drive around the three-sixteenths and improved position. UNO MORE settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the turn, swung five
 wide into the stretch then moved out another path and failed to rally. PRIVATE SONGSTER set the pace, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped
 to the rail. was headed at the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. JERRY N BO settled off the pace, started the turn in
 the two path, drafted behind rivals, shifted to the four path late on that bend, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. CAFERINA was urged
 along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GRANDE CHICA tracked the pace on the outside, raced
 in the three path on the turn, made a bid between horses at the five-sixteenths, dropped back turning into the stretch and came up empty. INDY BONES
 was urged along on the outside, dropped well behind while four then three wide on the turn and was no factor.

 wide into the stretch, kicked clear at the three-sixteenths, drew off into the final furlong and proved much the best under a moderate hand ride to win ridden
 out. AGENT PROVOCATEUR raced in the two path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn in the three path, was asked while four
 wide into the stretch, came between horses at the three-sixteenths, lugged inward in the final furlong and safely secured the place. TEMPLE SHADOW
 veered in at the start then became very rank under restraint, checked repeatedly while tossing her head straight in the air, continued under steadying
 restraint while inside through the first turn, moved out onto the backstretch then lagged near the back while still fighting the rider, was finally let out in the
 four then five path on the far turn, swung eight wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the show. OUR SWEET SYDNI raced
 in the two path on the first turn, set the pace, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner inside the
 quarter-pole and gave way. SNOBLIZ moved in early, raced in the two path on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while
 inside on the far turn, swung three wide into the stretch, chased past the three-sixteenths then tired. YALISHA was taken in hand early then keen into the
 first turn, saved ground on that bend, was rated off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed
 response. TOODALOO TO YOU saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while inside on the far turn, cut the corner
 into the stretch and failed to rally. BING went five then four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn,
 spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. BLESS D'CAT went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the
 far turn and never reached contention. RUNNINGDOWNDREAMS bumped solidly with KISS THAT DUDE at the start, went three wide on the first turn,
 settled towards the middle of the field, raced three wide on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. KISS THAT DUDE bumped
 hard with rivals at the start then steadied between those foes, was taken up while eager nearing the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, settled
 near the back, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MIENU bumped solidly with
 HOLD THE GREEN at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, raced four wide on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch and
 also failed to respond. HOLD THE GREEN bumped hard with opponents on both sides at the start then checked, went five then four wide on the first turn,
