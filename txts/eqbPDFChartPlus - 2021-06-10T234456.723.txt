 Footnotes
 EL ORO took over shortly after the start and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was asked leaving the five sixteenths pole, driven into the lane then taken
 in hand approaching the wire. After hesitating at the break, ALTERNATE ROUTE moved to the inside and rated off the pace, started a bid approaching the
 five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dueled for second past the eighth pole but proved no match for the winner. ZODIAC KID saved ground
 off the pace the first turn, eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, angled in approaching the far turn, drifted outward through the
 turn, entered the stretch six wide then flattened stride toward the wire. MANCHE steadied two deep nearing the three quarter pole then rated close off the
 rail, gave chase from the three eighths, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened stride the final sixteenth. POZZUOLI raced four wide the first turn and
 settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn but showed little further in the stretch.
 BAMBINOSBONNIEBLUE, off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, eased to the outside entering the backstretch, bid past the three eighths
 pole then flattened stride while in the four path of the far turn. GO TO THE TOP, off the pace in the four path the opening turn, was not a factor. WALL ST
 CHEATSHEET raced four wide the first turn and proved no factor. ROWDY'S RUNNER steadied in tight nearest the rail approaching the three quarter pole,
 rated close inside the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

 Footnotes
 OVERTHESPEEDLIMIT chased the pace from the outside and took over without encouragement near the three-eighths pole, drew clear before the
 five-sixteenths and angled in to round the turn on the rail, then drove down the lane under steady handling and lasted for first. PAUL AND SILAS was
 bumped at the start by Knutsford Park then saved ground into the first turn and chased the pace from the inside, made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole
 and took the turn on the rail, then dug in down the stretch and was slowly gaining on the winner. KNUTSFORD PARK broke out and bumped Paul and Silas
 at the start then angled in to the rail through the front stretch and settled off the pace inside, made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn
 in the four path, then moved to the outside at the head of the lane and gained down the stretch to finish well. GURSKY, saving ground into the first turn,
 settled off the pace inside, angled out and made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole, then rounded the turn in the five path and finished evenly.
 CINDERELLA'SPALACE settled well off the pace inside, made a bid approaching the three-eighths pole and eased to the outside, rounding the far turn in
 the eight path, then gained down the stretch and finished evenly. BIG BRANCH settled off the pace outside and made a bid approaching the five-sixteenths
 pole, took the far turn in the five path, then drifted out in the final sixteenth. PADDINGTON EXPRESS was never a factor. DEAN OF SALSA rushed up and
 angled in to rate the pace inside, was urged past the five-sixteenths pole but dropped back through the turn on the rail and faded in the lane. OPEN THE
 BANK was through early.

 RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW was hustled along while angling in to take the lead nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding
 the turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. LIL LINDER was hustled along with the early lead outside, gave chase from the five
 sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage in the three path of the turn then couldn't gain in the stretch. CLASSY LAKEFIELD chased the pace from
 the inside, rounded the turn at the rail and raced evenly down the lane. FOREST ACCORD lacked room while giving intermittent chase through the
 backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and finished evenly. LUNA CRESENTE gave early chase toward mid track, rounded the turn three wide,
 drifted a bit entering the stretch and finished evenly. BOSSLADY MARYANN B chased the pace toward the inside, raced at the rail rounding the turn but
 proved empty down the lane. DAKOTA MIST chased the pace toward mid track, rounded the turn in the six path and proved empty down the lane.
 MARIAH'S CALM raced well back and was not a factor. LADY KIKI came away awkwardly and raced outside.

 Footnotes
 VINTAGE GIN hustled up and angled in to rate a clear pace inside, rounded both turns on the rail, then drove down the lane under moderate handling and
 held on well. SALLIE GET UP was brushed by Quietly Breakaway at the start then settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the three-eighths
 pole and rounded the turn in the three path, eased out leaving the turn, then gained down the lane and was slowly closing on the winner.
 CASTLEINTHEMEADOW settled well off the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole and took the far turn in the five path, then
 finished evenly. CHERCHAZ LA FEMME settled off the pace inside, made a bid approaching the three-eighths pole, went around the far turn on the rail,
 then finished evenly. CRAFTY MAUDE, saving ground into the first turn, chased the pace inside, drew to near even terms near the seven-sixteenths pole
 and gave close chase through the backstretch and turn in the three path, but dropped back leaving the turn and faded. CLASSY DI saved ground moving
 into the first turn and settled well off the pace inside, made a bid near the quarter pole on the rail, then eased out leaving the turn and finished evenly.
 CHARITABLE STEP broke a step slow and was never a factor. GATTOBEABRAT saved ground going into the first turn but was never a factor; after the
 race, was unsaddled in the turn, appeared sore, and was vanned off. QUIETLY BREAKAWAY broke in and brushed Sallie Get Up at the start but was
 through early.

 ANYLADYSINTHEHOUSE settled back off the rail into the first turn, eased out entering the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, took over three
 wide midway on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth. COLOR ME SEXY saved ground into the first turn and rated close off
 the rail, dueled to a brief lead past the quarter pole, was promptly caught leaving the three sixteenths pole then continued a close factor to mid-stretch
 before flattening stride. KILT CHASER settled back off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased four wide into the
 lane, was along for third inside the eighth pole but couldn't gain further. ME TOO veered out after coming out slowly, settled well back in the two and three
 paths the opening turn, bid at the quarter pole, eased nine wide through the far turn and finished evenly widest. WORK WIFE came away slowly and saved
 ground racing well back, improved her position nearest the rail rounding the turn and raced evenly in the stretch. THELADYISALION settled just off the pace
 inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then flattened stride while drifting outward on the far turn. SIMPLYLUCKY rushed up off the rail and moved to
 the inside past the three quarter pole, was pressured for more approaching the five sixteenths pole, headed midway on the far turn, dropped back at the rail
 past the three sixteenths pole then weakened in the stretch. Y'ER WAN broke out to make contact with Disco Party and rated off the pace toward the inside,
 eased out into the backstretch, bid mildly past the three eighths pole then faded in the seven path of the far turn. DISCO PARTY, bumped soundly at the
 break, raced in the four and five paths the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole then faded rounding the far turn. AMOUR'S CHARM, off the pace in
 the three path the first turn, faded through the backstretch.

 Footnotes
 CEREBRAL settled well off the pace on the outside, made a bid approaching the three-eighths pole and angled in past the five-sixteenths to take the turn in
 the three path, then drove down the lane under moderate handling to come up first in later yards and widen to the wire. NYE rushed up and angled in to rate
 a clear pace inside, took both turns on the rail, then dug in gamely in the stretch but was caught in later yards and had to settle for second. SCHLOSSER
 chased the pace inside, eased out slightly through the backstretch and made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole, then rounded the turn in the four path
 and leveled off in the stretch. HARDENED WILDCAT broke a step slow then settled well back on the outside, made a bid approaching the three-eighths
 pole and rounded the turn in the five path, then flattened out in the stretch. UNTETHERED broke a step slow then angled in to the rail early in the front
 stretch, settled off the pace on the inside and made a bid past the three-eighths pole, then rounded the far turn on the rail and weakened in the stretch.
 WHINE FOR WINE broke a step slow and was through early. PRINCE DEREK was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 COWGIRL CUT chased the pace toward the inside, raced at the rail rounding the turn, eased just outside the runner-up leaving the eighth pole and dug in to
 best that one the final yards. BROOKE'S APPEAL quickly took the lead while angling in and rated the pace inside, was pressured into the turn, dug in under
 hardy stretch handling but was caught the final yards. ELUSIVE CAMILLA engaged in close early chase inside, eased off the rail past the three eighths pole,
 had aim three wide through the turn then flattened out the final sixteenth. WAVES ON THE SEA gave chase from well off the pace toward the outside,
 rounded the turn in the three path and finished well. BOP ALONG gave early chase toward mid track, angled to the inside midway on the turn but showed
 little down the lane. MOCHKLA MOCHKLA chased the pace from the inside, raced at the rail most of the turn, angled seven wide approaching the head of
 the lane and finished evenly. PLATINUM BAND angled in to give chase, rounded the turn in the four path then weakened down the lane. MORNING VOW,
 bumped at the break, gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the five and six paths and showed little further in the lane. ARANZA gave early
 chase in the three and four paths, raced wider than necessary through the turn and was not a factor. DIXIE COLONY broke out to make contact with
 Morning Vow, angled to the outside to give chase and raced wide on the turn.
