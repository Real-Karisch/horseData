 TOO TALL TONY set the pace while saving ground, opened up a clear advantage down the backstretch, turned back bids from CABO WABO BABY and
 UNLEASH THE BEAST when challenged at the quarter pole, cleared again into the stretch and was all out to narrowly prevail. AUBREY pressed the pace
 from off the rail, angled out four wide for the drive and rallied belatedly to just miss. CABO WABO BABY was never far back while racing outside a rival,
 offered a strong bid at the quarter pole and weakened late. CAJUN CASH stalked the pace while racing three wide and showed no late bid. UNLEASH THE
 BEAST raced three wide into the first turn, stalked the pace, bid between rivals at the quarter marker and failed to sustain that bid. TOLEDO PACHE trailed
 throughout. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

 room and showed a good rally. GUNNY MO dueled for the lead while racing outside a rival and weakened. THE ONLY DREAM, away alertly, vied for the
 early advantage along the rail, opened up a clear lead on the second turn and tired late. WHERE'S RUFUS raced four wide on the first turn, pressed the
 pace for six furlongs and tired. CIBOLO PETE raced three wide on the first turn, was allowed to settle into stride, was five wide through the second turn and
 lacked a late response. PLAY FOR JOY never threatened. CHODY N DANIEL, unhurried early, raced four wide through the second turn and was not a
 factor. LITTLE CKRAIG was slow early and not a threat. BELFRY raced in mid-pack, offered a bid between foes at the half mile pole and failed to sustain
 that bid. EL VENDABAL was five wide into the first turn, raced close up for a half mile, tired and was eased through the stretch.

 Footnotes
 MADE ME TALK broke sharply, stalked the pace while saving ground, angled out at the eighth pole and was up in the final jump. GUNTHER rushed to the
 lead and angled over once clear, set the pace while saving ground and was caught late. TOPCATMARK raced three wide on the first turn, pressed the pace
 off the rail and weakened in the final stages. SAINT FLOYD was never far back while racing between horses and lacked a late response. MR LEXIS was
 slow early, raced six wide into the stretch and improved his position. TIZ TOWN, away alertly, dropped back and was not a factor. SUMMER APPEAL, void
 of early foot, offered a bid along the rail in the upper stretch but failed to sustain that bid. JIM'S EAGLE raced three wide on the first turn and failed to
 threaten. STREET LIFE BLUES raced three wide on the first turn, settled in mid pack, was four wide through the second turn and faded.
