 Footnotes
 THE COLE WAR was off a step slow, settled just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the fore
 inside the furlong marker and drew clear. VADOMA pressed the pace of SOCIAL VOW while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
 five-sixteenths pole, quickly opened a clear lead and yielded to the winner through the final furlong. CASTLE ZIP was off a step slow, lagged far back early,
 raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. IDE BE SILLY lacked early speed, raced four-wide
 through the turn and did not threaten. SOCIAL VOW broke sharply to set a pressured pace and weakened after going a half.

 Footnotes
 DUNK A DIN broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by BLINDSIDED BLUES nearing the quarter, opened a
 clear lead with a furlong to run and was ridden out to the wire to increase that margin. BLINDSIDED BLUES steadied soon after the start, pressed the pace
 of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the quarter, drifted out in mid-stretch and was no match in the drive. MCHENRY
 lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position into the stretch and finished evenly late. NETELA was fractious at the
 gate, off slow, rushed to be forwardly placed and gradually weakened.

 HOLIDAY SWEETS was reluctant to load then hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked at the three-eighths
 then ridden along in the two to three path on the far turn, gained ground under the whip into the stretch, chased the runner-up into the final furlong, gained
 the lead at the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. ST. MERRIMAN went to the front, raced in the two path early on the first turn then
 dropped to the rail, set the clear pace on an easy lead, dictated terms while inside through the far turn, was asked at the top of the stretch, remained clear
 into the final furlong, was collared at the sixteenth-pole then outfinished while well clear for the place. REESE'S GLORY was taken up entering the first turn,
 raced in the two path on that bend, settled in second position, was urged along late on the backstretch, came up empty in the two path on the far turn and
 was best of the rest. FIRST REUNION settled on the inside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, moved out late on the backstretch, went three to
 four wide on the far turn and faltered.
