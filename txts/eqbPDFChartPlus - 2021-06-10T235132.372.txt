 JUST BY CHANCE had a clear lead from the start, drew off as the race went on and won driving. HE'S FROM QUEENS went around the first turn in the
 three path while running towards the rear, got a spot on the rail on the backstretch and began to pick up the pace after half a mile, continued the forward
 momentum into the stretch and had an inside rally. MOZART MELODY tracked the pace while going two wide around both turns, ran gamely through the
 finish but was no match. CODE NAME RAVEN sat well rated off the pace while on the inside, swung wide into the stretch and gained position. WAR AT
 SUNRISE was well rated off the pace while going two wide around the turns, swung even wider into the stretch and was able to gain positioning.
 VALENTINO'S DAY tracked the pace on the outside going three wide around the turns, was full of run at the five sixteenths pole but flattened out.
 COUNTRY MONEY was hustled out of the fate and went up to chase the pace on the outside going three wide around the first turn then weakened for the
 drive. TRAVELING AFOOT failed to menace. TOUGH KENNETT MAN chased the pace between horses going two wide, stopped at the three eighths pole
 and was eased.
