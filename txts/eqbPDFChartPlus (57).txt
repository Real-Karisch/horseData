 MONTCLAIR (IRE) raced off the pace inside, moved up entering the far turn, bid three wide midway on the turn, took charge at the top of the lane, drew off
 and was ridden out. LUCKY BALLADIER vied inside for command, then dueled inside, battled back on the rail in the stretch drive and earned the place spot.
 DREAMING OF FRANK vied two wide for the early lead, then dueled two wide, dug in and was outfinished late for second. CHEDDAR CHUB stalked the
 pacesetters, moved up three wide on the backside, bid four wide at the quarter pole and was outkicked. NEXT COWBOY UP raced two wide off the pace
 and did not factor. BLACK PRONG was moving just prior to the gate opening, hit the gate and had a terrible start, outrun early, advanced inside into
 contention on the backside, then gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry, BLACK PRONG was declared a non-starter for wagering purposes, due to the
 incident in the gate.

 Footnotes
 DARK ROAST dueled two wide for the early lead, battled heads apart outside of LIKE WHAT I SEE through a spirited stretch duel and got the nod at the
 wire. LIKE WHAT I SEE dueled inside for command, dug in gamely along the rail entering the stretch, battled determinedly through the final furlong and just
 missed. TAKE COVER stalked in the early stages, chased the dueling leaders on the turn, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly while lacking a
 winning bid. SAUCY DON raced off the pace inside and failed to rally. UNRULY HEIR was reluctant loading, chased three wide and tired. TWO NOTCH
 ROAD did not factor. SCHOOLOFHARDROCKS raced off the rail and did not factor.

 Footnotes
 CONFIRM raced off the rail, off the pace, made a four wide move into contention on the backside, rallied outside, took over and drew clear, driving.
 EMILIANA'S HOPE raced three wide early, stalked three wide, rallied inside on the far turn, dug in and held on for second. PROSPECTIVE BELLE raced off
 the pace inside, advanced three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly and was closing late to miss for the place. BAMBOO GARDEN was outrun early and
 passed tired rivals. STASHA MINASHA stalked two wide and faded. LOST PRINCESS tracked inside and gave way. BEACH TAG pulled a bit early, set the
