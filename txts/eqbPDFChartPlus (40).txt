 Footnotes
 MAXUM chased from the outside on the turn, raced in the five path entering the stretch and finished gamely to prevail. FULL OF GOLD hustled early and up
 close, raced between rivals passing the eighth pole challenging for the lead then continued on willingly while unable to match the top one nearing the wire.
 RUNNING FOR GUS never far back and five wide entering the lane, needed more in the drive. DAKATI near the rail on the turn, offered a late gain inside.
 OUR MONEY CAT trailed and lacked the needed rally. STONE CREEK set the pace and weakened in the drive.

 SOUGHT MORE PEP up close just off the inside, moved out in upper stretch, reached the leader a furlong out and finished well while edging clear late.
 BONITA RAPIDS four deep into the clubhouse turn, tracked on the backstretch, vied for the lead turning for home and drifted some, drew clear between
 calls in upper stretch then was overtaken late. IF YOU WANT IT raced in the two path into the far turn, was five wide into the lane and lacked the needed
 closing response. DIVA'S DIVA saved ground, bid along the inside in the lane then weakened in the drive. MISS N WILDCAT forwardly placed early, raced
 in the six path into the stretch and tired. MY EXPRESSION raced outside in the run down the backstretch and lacked a rally. NAUGHTY SWAGGER set the
 pace, gave way inside the eighth pole and was taken in hand.

 CADILLAC CHROME was hustled along inside, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held off KNIGHT SOLAIRE to just last at the wire. KNIGHT
 SOLAIRE vied to the turn, bore out, fell back, closed once straightened and was gaining fast late. LIL BIT OF THUNDER went nine wide at the top of the
 stretch, closed steadily and got up for show. CURRENTLY KRAZY raced close to the pace, put in a steady effort and didn't have enough late. FRISKY
 RICKY raced mid pack, bid inside on the turn and hung in the lane. COZY BAR was never far back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and faded
 under mild urging. RIVER HOUSE broke in, bid inside on the turn and came up empty. DREAM ON FOR SPEED saved ground and was not a factor in an
 even effort. BRAVE ACTION showed speed to the turn, fell back and was not urged through the stretch.

 EITHER WAY broke a bit slowly, stayed outside and raced in the six path entering the stretch then finished well and drew out. TAKE CHARGE GWEN up
 close inside, bid for the lead in the lane then earned the place. ZIBO pressed the issue then needed more in the drive. MINISTER'S GIRL set the pace
 under pressure, battled into midstretch then yielded late. FRAN'S EMPIRE forwardly placed, lacked the needed late response. SECRET ALIBI saved
 ground and lacked a bid. ROSELLA LADY also saved ground and lacked a bid. LUCKY MAC up close early, chased on the turn and tired. SOUTHSIDE
 CAROLINE raced outside and had no rally. AURORA NIGHT fractious in the gate unseating the rider, broke slowly and failed to be a serious factor.
 CHERYL IN CHARGE also fractious in the gate unseating the rider, showed little.

 IRON BELL was unhurried early, saved ground, advanced to the turn, angled out for the drive, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up in the final
 strides. FORTHWITH dueled inside to the second turn, drew off for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outfinished. SPITTIN HAVOC was never far
 back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. ENOUGH OF THAT was rated back at the start, bid inside
 entering the stretch and finished well. ARIZONA RY dueled two across to the second turn, fell back and finished evenly. DANTHEMANLEVITAN bumped at
 the start, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked the needed rally. HICKS IS LIT was never far back, advanced to the second turn, tired and
 gave way. QUIET BUT DEADLY was through after a half and dropped back. CALIMONCO FLYER bumped at the start, raced wide and was not urged late.

 Footnotes
 BROZILIAN (BRZ) trailed early and near the rail turning for home, advanced inside and reached the front passing the sixteenth pole then held to the wire.
 OLD GUARD brushed with a rival turning for home, raced in the five path entering the stretch and finished gamely while just missing. DISPUTED moved six
 wide into the lane and finished willingly. RADIOTRON moved up leaving the chute drawing clear, set the pace and weakened in the drive. MISSION
 RELAUNCH forwardly placed, was brushed turning for home and six wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response. JUNE AND JOHNNY saved
 ground, chased through the lane then weakened. TUONO had no rally. S S TANK lacked a rally. CRESCENT WILDCAT showed the way through the
 opening stages then tracked, chased on the turn and weakened. MAGIC MAHOGANY saved ground and tired through the lane. BIRDTAIL MOUNTAIN
 weakened on the turn.
