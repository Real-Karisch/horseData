 LADY TEMPLE chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, moved closer into the far turn while three wide, swung into the lane three wide, inched
 to the lead outside the eighth pole then cleared inside the sixteenth. POLAR VORTEX was off to an awkward start and spotted the field at least a length and
 a half, tracked the pace along the inside through the far turn while never far back, cut the corner into the lane and finished with good energy to be up for the
 place spot. TWO CARROT RANSOM stalked then chased the pace into the far turn while in the two path , bid into the lane then lacked the needed
 response. INDIAN FEATHER set the pace while near the rail into the lane, dueled with the winner to inside the eighth pole then yielded. MIRACLES TAKE

 final eighth. NOT E Z BEINGGREEN was in the two or three path through the turn, was under strong handling inside the eighth pole, split rivals inside the
 sixteenth pole and gained the place. TOINFINITYNBEYOND was in the four or five path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane then lacked the
 needed response while saving the show spot. VREELAND bumped and forced in at the start, raced in the two path through the turn and never was a factor.

 Footnotes
 I AM MISS BROWN was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path when gaining momentum, edged to the front in deep
 stretch and was all out to last. BELA MENINA was void of speed while in the two to the four path through the turn, swung into the lane from mid-track,
 commenced a rally while seven wide and finished with a rush to just miss. NAKED BOOTLEG was unhurried while in the three path, bid in mid-turn, gained
 the lead in late turn, cleared into the lane, widened the advantage inside the eighth pole then could not hold the top two safe. CAREER GIRL was in the two
 to the five path through the far turn, came into the lane from the six path, angled in when gaining momentum and finished up well.
 AWALKINTHEMOONLITE was along the inside through the turn when shuffled back, continued along the rail into the lane and was gaining too late. KOOL
 AID GIRL chased the pace along the inside into the turn, came further off the inside in mid-turn, remained in contention into the lane and then needed more.
 RASCOFRADE was in the three path through the turn when never a threat, swung into the lane from the eight path and never was a factor. PUPPY ON A
 STRING set the pace along the inside into the late turn then gave way once headed. AFOOLSBROKENHEART was in the four path through the far turn
 when being asked for more then was empty turning into the lane. CHEVY TO THE LEVY pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, began losing ground
 after mid-turn then retreated through the lane. Due to a timer malfunction the quarter time was provided by Trakus.

 widened through the final eighth. CRAFTYS LIL SIS jostled at the start, was unhurried while saving ground, came off the inside into the lane and finished
 with good energy. ACIONNA was near the rail while never far back, came into the lane from the three path, had aim on the winner with an eighth to go,
 could not gain and lost the place spot late. FROSTED JUSTICE crowded at the start, was in the three path through the turns and was never a threat.
 BRONZE AIR raced in pursuit from the three or four path through the far turn, was asked for more in late turn then flattened in the lane. PROPER
