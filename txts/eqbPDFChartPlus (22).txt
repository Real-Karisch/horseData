 Footnotes
 LAND OR SEA tracked three deep, took over midway through the second turn, widened into the stretch and maintained a diminishing advantage.
 MUSHABOOM was allowed to settle, ranged into striking distance five wide, loomed large entering the stretch, but was unable to bridge the gap. INPLAY
 prompted the pace off of the inside, angled in leaving the second turn, but flattened during the drive and settled for the show. SCREAMIN DIXIE broke slow,
 moved up five wide to make her bid, but faltered entering the stretch and faded. TALES OF MISCHIEF was allowed to settle, wheeled out five wide leaving
 the second turn, but failed to make headway. SIMPLY FIT set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed before going six furlongs and gave way
 readily. STAYTRUETODAGAME showed little.

 Footnotes
 BALIZAR tracked four wide, took over leaving the turn, shook clear, was kept to task and held sway. CHARGIN STORM stalked the pace, came five wide to
 make his bid, continued on well but was unable to reach the winner. SURPRISE PRIZE attended the pace off of the inside, angled out entering the stretch
 and churned on to earn the show. PSYCHO CAT bobbled at the start, was unhurried into stride, swung to the far outside and improved position.
 PREEMPTIVE STRIKE settled in hand, looped up six wide, loomed a danger but faltered in the final furlong. MY FOOLISH BEAU was hustled along off of
 the inside, angled out but failed to make headway. ATTACK THE SHACK disputed the pace along the inside through the turn and dropped out. RONTOS
 SOCIETY was through after a half.

 TENACIOUS SALLY was unhurried into stride, made a sweeping move five wide, took over entering the stretch and edged clear. SCAT LADY was away
 alertly, set the pressured pace between horses, fought on but was unable to match strides with the winner. COWGIRL TYNE was allowed to settle, came
 four wide and was fully extended to earn the show. SKY TIME NOW lunged at the start to get away slow, advanced between rivals, waited in traffic leaving
 the second turn, split foes but lacked the needed late response. LOOKING AT EDY attended the pace along the inside through the second turn and tired.
 DON'T GET EVEN prompted the pace three wide to the second turn, but came up empty between runners and dropped out.

 Footnotes
 THE CURT FOX (GB) tracked the pace early, fanned into the five path in the turn, drove past the leader in the stretch and cleared the field while ridden out
 to the wire. SUCKER PUNCHED set the pace early, angled off the rail in the turn and yielded late in the stretch run. COLONEL'S INA RUSH chased the
 pace early, swung into the six path in the turn, made a bid in the stretch but hung in the late stages. DUSTY was in tight early on, fanned into the seven path
 in the turn, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. EMMETT'S DREAM stalked the pace early, angled off the rail in the turn and faded
 late in the stretch run. DREAMMEISTER was never a threat. CATAROUX was done early. THE LAST DISCIPLE was never a factor.
