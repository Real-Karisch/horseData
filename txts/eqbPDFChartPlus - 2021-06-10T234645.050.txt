 Footnotes
 PRINCESS PEGGY came under some brisk hand encouragement securing a forward position, stalked the leader two to three wide, applying only the
 minimalist of pressure on GIRL'S NIGHT, was put to a drive leaving the five-sixteenths marker, commenced the stretch drive by angling four wide into it,
 moved in short order much closer to the rail, same as the runner up, began the final furlong holding a slim advantage and lengthened away. GIRL'S NIGHT
 away the shapest of them all, retained the lead, carved out the pace, rated and kept at a slight distance from off the rail, drifted three wide getting called
 upon for the stretch run, only to shift back towards the inside route right afterwards, got creled in with about an eighth to go, then held the place.
 ORBOLUTION a bit sluggish down the backstretch, stepped on the turn two wide, fanned out into path four from upper to midstretch and made no impact.
 MERMAID OF HONOR got steadied cutting over to the rail coming to the end of backstretch, tracked the leader while pulling a bit on the bit early on the
 turn, was given her cue and launched an abbreciated bid approaching the quarter pole, got angled three to four wide and tired. WANDA FAY losting her
 footing springing from the gate, raced three and placed to steady encouragement after entering the turn until set down to a drive before reachng the
 five-sixteenths pole, failed to menace all told.

 Footnotes
 KATIE ICE broke out at the start despite being corrected and bumped CATS HALO, then was clipped behind by that rival, cut the pace along the inside
 taking to the two path through the turn patiently handled, swung three to four wide for home set down for the drive, drew clear to the eighth pole, saw her
 margin cut into late on while holding well and clear to the finish. CATS HALO got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe then bobbled when clipping
 that rival behind, chased the pace along the inside, came under coaxing in the two path three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and
 offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. OVER MY HEAD chased just off the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three
 wide at that station, offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. ARGYLE GAL three wide in pursuit from near the rear, got coaxed along at the
 three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. LADY CHOCOLOTTA four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing five-sixteenths
 from home, swung five wide at the head of the stretch, tired. TWO TERM MAX forwardly placed three wide in pursuit, came under a ride with five-sixteenths
 remaining, spun five wide for home and tired. MISSY MOUSE brushed the off side stall at the start, chased four wide under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to

 Footnotes
 KILLYBEGS CAPTAIN prompted the leader from the two path, undertaking the task being well rated, was still in hand grabbing a narrow advantage as the
 half was being reached, got put to a drive a sixteenth later, drifted out a bit late kicking clear. RIVER DEEP took up the chase from the three path being
 hand urged, quickened at the five-sixteenths marker and after being given his cue challenged in earnest coming to the quarter pole, got staved off and had
 to settle for the place. LOVE YOUR BUTTONS was put to a strong ride during the initial furlong, pursued the front runners from the four path on the turn,
 shifted out towards path six after making it into the stretch, appeared a bit green securing the show. RAREST QUALITY out-broke the field and retained the
 lead, got guided over to the inside, vied for command matched up with the winner to the outside, gave in when put to the test as the second split was about
 to be posted on the board then steadily backed away. PRESIDENTIAL BIRD slid its way over to the ouverland route midway on the turn and was never
 involved. TOWNIE chased two wide, got spotted three wide at the head of the stretch and gave way.

 Footnotes
 SCARLET GODDESS showed the way from the two path, got put to a drive in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, kicked clear the remainder of the trip
 to the eighth pole, then added to the winning margin, kept to the task at hand. SISELLA prompted the winner from the three path, was slightly wider at the
 top of the lane and proved no match. FORRES LILY took up the chase primarily from the two path, after taking the inside route but for only a spell, that
 being from the top of the turn to its midway point, was put to a drive for the drive and got outfinished. VALIANT SPIRIT two wide and loosely drafting behind
 the top one during the run around the bend, got sent out into path six during the initial portion of the stretch and came up empty. BAHNAHNO got away in an
 awkard manner after appearing to throw its head as the field was sent on its way, departed the backstretch from the two path and never involved.
 UNLIMITED RESOURCE two to three wide on the turn, gave way. BIGKAT AND CAMILLE pursued the front runners from the four path on the turn, got
 driven into path seven heading for midlane to no avail.

 Footnotes
 MISHEGAS remained along the inside route down the backstretch, tipped out into the two path nearing the half mile pole, sat boxed in from the top of the
 turn to the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, had room and was steered out into the four path and into clearance at that station, was put to a hard drive
 taking the five path for entrance into the stretch, bid in earnest once straightened, emerged at the eighth pole as the undisputed leader then remained
 comfortably in the clear. INDYCOTT rode the rail to the quarter pole, got taken to the outside, eventually having altered course into the six path with a
 furlong remaining, rallied for the place. J S BACH was put to some light encouragement establishing control, settled into the two path, showed the way being
 pressed by PAID ADMISSION to the outside, came under heavier pressure once MARRIAGE FEVER arrived on the scene midway on the turn, got set
 down a sixteenth down the road, held out on the front end to upper stretch before being reeled in by the winner, then tired in the final furlong. PRAETEREO
 departed the backstrech from the three path, got put to a drive by the three-eighths pole, moved out into path seven from upper to midlane and came up
 empty. ARE WE NOT MEN prompted the leader from the three path, went about it from between rivals from midpoint on the turn to the upper stretch and
 gave way. MARRIAGE FEVER travelled four wide on the turn, was let out a notch and ranged up to press the issue as the widest of a trio from the
 three-eighths pole to upper stretch, was already under a drive spinning into the lane, tired. PAID ADMISSION hung out five wide on the bend, folded then
 completed the stretch run not asked.

 SEEKING PARADISE tracked the pace just off the inside in range of the leader, got set down continuing just off the inside for home, rallied taking to the
 inside nearing the sixteenth marker as MORE ROYALTY drifted a bit opening up the seam, burst through to take command at the sixteenth marker under
 threat to the outside and dug in gamely being taken out to get a better look at her main threat in the final jumps and held on gamely to prevail. RUMBLE
 DOLL settled three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun four wide at the quarter pole, rallied to offer up a
 good kick surging late but just missed on the wire. ONE LAST SHOT chased four then three wide through the turn, got let out spinning three wide into upper
 stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. ELEGANT SUPERMODEL (GER) forwardly placed just off the inside, got roused spinning from
 the two path at the head of the stretch, weakened in the late stages. MORE ROYALTY showed the way along the inside through solid splits in hand until
 roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in inching away to the eighth pole under growing threat from a quartet in close pursuit, got headed a
 sixteenth from home and weakened in the late going. SWISS RANGE (GB) tracked the pace along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch put to
 encouragement, offered no response.

 Footnotes
 LEAH'S DREAM away without apparent mishap, was put to a hand ride nearly from the start, gradually shifted inward midway on the backstretch, showed
 the way spotted at a slight distance from off the rail, rider still hand urging the mount, got set down at the three-sixteenths marker and responded enough to
 to begin the last eighth holding its largest advantage, held sway. FIRST APPEAL three wide entering the turn, picked up interest being sent to the outside at
 the five-sixteenths pole, wound up approximately five wide a furlong later, gained late but without ever posing a threat. SANDY BELLE three wide on the
 turn, was sent four wide exiting it, got the show. GIANT ENDING chased the pace three to four wide on the turn, got roused by the five-sixteenths marker,
 commenced the stretch towards path five, lacked the needed response. MYSIDEOFTHESTREET saved ground to no avail. TWEET STREET got steaded
 midway on the backstretch as the top one worked its way to the inside, chased the foe from the two path, was slightly wider at the top of the lane and gave
 way.
