 LOVE THAT CHICK outrun early between rivals, angled out advancing into the stretch and edged clear late following a long drive. WISE TRADE prompted
 the pace outside and continued willingly to the finish. TIMELY PLEASURE moved to the front on the turn, led to the final sixteenth but tired. SHE'S A
 MONSTER hustled just off the pace outside and battled to the finish. CEE MAXINE chased inside and began fading on the turn. AGELESS TALES dropped
 far behind and was never in contention. GUN POWDER RED set a clear pace inside to the far turn then gave way through the stretch. POWER BOOKED
 steadied between rivals into the far turn and faded. HELEN'S LAST DANCE broke slowest and stopped abruptly.

 MALANDRINA, wide and just off the pace, challenged for the lead in early stretch then took over near mid stretch then drew off. AUSSIE MIST saved
 ground setting the early pace but was no match. SILVER EXCESS didn't break sharply, raced two wide, moved out then split rivals in stretch but was no
 threat. STROLL ACTION had her her head pointed upward at the break and dwelt then bore out and raced very wide. MERCY dueled for command three
 wide before giving way. BELLA FILOMENA didn't break sharply, saved ground and showed little. SAVANNAH ROXANNA, between rivals vying for
 command, tired.

 RISQUE REBEL alternated for the lead from the four path, drifted out through deep stretch and slowly inched clear. WONDERFULLY TUNED didn't break
 sharply, raced two wide while unhurried, split foes through deep stretch and was gaining. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF, in the three path vying for command,
 drifted out through deep stretch and weakened slightly. ARRECIFE came out and bumped with LITTLE SIETE leaving gate, was in tight on the backstretch,
 went wide, lacked a strong closing kick. LITTLE SIETE came in leaving gate contributing to the bumping with ARRECIFE, was three wide in top flight before
 tiring. BANG THE DRUM, just off the rail and just off the pace, flattened out. MIDNIGHT HARBOR showed little.

 FOUR FREEDOMS dueled outside, took over midway on the turn and drew away under moderate urging. KOOK'S KAT weaved through traffic on the turn
 and in the stretch and was up for the place late. CATBURT stalked the pacesetters three wide and continued willingly. JACK STRAIGHT moved close
 outside in the opening quarter then flattened out in the stretch. PERFECT ICE dueled along the rail to midway on the turn then faltered. LIGHTNING BUZZ
 dropped back early and lacked a rally. CAPT. GRIDER saved ground off the pace and gave way readily. GRAYMOND was jostled from both sides at the
 start then trailed throughout.

 BUD FOX was very wide racing into and rounding the first turn, remained wide settling into the stretch, gradually moved towards the rail on the far turn,
 edged away in early stretch and continued to widen under mild handling. D T GOODIE, two wide early, was left with the rail on far turn, took up chase but
 was no match. YOU'RE NO SAINT, very wide while outrun, passed tiring foes. MBRACE GRACE, widest in top flight, moved in a bit after a half, drifted out
 entering stretch and tired. TO THE VICTOR saved ground and failed to menace. DIRT IN YOUR FACE, widest in second flight, tired. CONQUEST
 BIGLUCK E prompted the pace lapped on winner then stopped.

 JEMROSE trailed through the opening quarter, split foes rallying on the turn, surged in the stretch and was geared down in the late stages.. LUXICHARM
 raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, led in mid-stretch but could not hold off the winner. AGORA bobbled at the break, chased wide and continued
 willingly while no threat. GOBI dropped back inside, steadied near the top of the stretch then made a late gain. COMFORTABLE CAT set a clear pace off
 the inside then proved empty in the final furlong. KITTY'S RIGHT lacked speed and gave way readily. IT'S SHOW TIME was urged close up outside then
 began stopping on the turn.

 match. SWEET CANDY DANCE, very wide throughout, lacked a strong closing kick. LOVE ON FIRE, two wide vying for command, tired. FILIBUSTIN

 Footnotes
 UPANDCOMING set the pace very wide then drew away through the final furlong while kept to her task. RACHEYBULLBAH chased close up between rivals
 and continued willingly while no match for the winner. GRAND BLUE HARBOR vied along the inside then came up empty in the stretch. CAROLE'S
 RAINBOW unruly prior to the start, chased close up outside and tired. SATURDAYS GAME saved ground just off the leaders and gradually faded. NOT IN
 THE MOOD lagged far behind then passed rivals without menacing. COLESLITTLEMONSTER dropped back early and was always outrun. CHICKIE'S
 PLACE chased within striking range then gave way readily. REWRITE THE RULES broke very slowly and was never in contention. PHILJANGLE lacked
 speed and stopped abruptly. HADITUPTOHERE dropped back badly on the turn. J D'S PRIDE broke through the gate prior to the start unseating her rider
 and running off and was ordered a late scratch by the stewards. There was an eight minute delay in the post time for this race.
