 HELLO MISS rushed to the lead along the inside to set the pressured pace, shook off SWEET EXCURSION leaving the turn and widened. SWEET
 EXCURSION chased three wide, was unable to go on with the winner, but fought on to just hold the place. LUSCIOUS LUCY broke slow, was unhurried into
 stride, rallied between horses entering the stretch and was just up to earn the show. VAN'S FLYING BABY was close up, settled off of the pace midway
 through the turn, drifted out entering the lane and faltered in the drive. WITCHWAYTOTHEARGO settled in the second flight and failed to threaten. BEE
 BEE Q showed little.

 Footnotes
 DANCING AVA was unhurried, made a sweeping move six wide, reeled in the leaders nearing the furlong marker and kicked clear. SASSY AND REGAL
 settled in hand, tucked in to save ground, got through and was fully extended to earn the place. WHODATTCAT rushed to the lead, set the pressured pace
 three deep, weakened between runners in the final furlong and settled for the minor award. FOR YU MICHELLE was away in good order, vied for the lead
 off of the inside, shifted out leaving the turn, but flattened during the drive. TAINTED PAINT was unhurried into stride, finished with a belated improvement
 but failed to threaten. BLUE WILLOW was allowed to settle, came five wide but failed to make headway. BOGSIDE failed to respond. ITZPAPALOTL was
 close up three wide through the turn and tired. ASPEN DANCER showed brief foot inside but stopped before going a half.

 Footnotes
 OHIO ROSE pressed the pace along the inside, settled off of the leader on the backstretch, shifted out and re-engaged three wide, struck the front a furlong
 out and edged clear. UMAMI set the pressured pace three deep, opened clear and angled in after a half, was collared nearing the quarter pole, disputed the
 issue to inside the furlong marker but was unable to match strides. THUNDER MAY broke a step slow, moved up five wide, continued on willingly and was
 along for the show. PAPPIAS PLEASURE contended three wide, but lacked a response when called upon. STORMED OFF was allowed to settle, closed
 the gap through the second turn toward the inside, angled out entering the stretch to make a mild bid, but failed to sustain the drive.
 ANGELOFTHEMORNING was allowed to settle, angled in to save ground, but was never a factor. NA' BAC LEIS was forwardly placed four wide through
 the second turn and caved. MISS CHUCKIE H veered out at the start to get away behind his field, was rank to place and wide through the first turn, dropped
 well back and trailed.

 STRAW DOG tracked four wide, drew even leaving the turn, continued on well but was unable to match strides with the winner. BUBBA J was hustled along
 three wide, angled in entering the stretch and finished willingly for the show. CLEANOUT THEOFFICE was allowed to settle, circled seven wide and was
 making up ground. SUPER FRANCHISE was unhurried, finished with a belated improvement, but failed to threaten. THISONESFORUDAD broke a step
 slow, settled inside, got through and passed the tiring ones. IN MY REAR VIEW failed to respond. FEISTY RUBIANO contended along the inside for a half
 and retreated. THREE SOCKS sprinted clear to set the pace off of the inside, was collared between horses and stopped after a half. OHIO CHROME was

 SKY TIME NOW stalked the pace, drew even after a half, shook clear entering the stretch, was kept to task and maintained a diminishing advantage.
 PRETTY GRITTY was allowed to settle, advanced between horses, quickened in the final sixteenth but was unable to bridge the gap. THE RIDGE was
 unhurried into stride, took closer order on the second turn, split rivals and loomed a danger but failed to sustain the drive. THIG AR LATHA broke in
 bumping SAMURAI JEAN at the start, was forwardly placed three deep, drifted out further leaving the second turn and tired. TIZ ALL BIZ was away alertly,
 set a clear pace, was collared after a half, contested the issue to the stretch and retreated. SAMURAI JEAN was bumped and squeezed at the start, settled
 in hand four wide, but came up empty before going six furlongs and dropped out.
