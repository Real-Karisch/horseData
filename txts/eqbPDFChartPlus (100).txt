 Footnotes
 ABUELA LOCA drifted out into the first turn, controlled the pace then drew away eagerly while kept to a brisk hand ride until the final yards. WEE BONNIE
 LASS saved ground throughout and continued well while no match for the winner. FLASHY SIREN urged close up just off the pace and never menaced.
 FLOWERS FROM TONY chased between rivals for half a mile and gave way. GIRL CRUSH was fanned wide into the first turn and never a factor. HERE'S
 KELLY was jostled between rivals into the first turn and retreated. DISCOMANIA fanned extremely wide into first turn and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul
 by the rider of HERE'S KELLY against the rider of GIRL CRUSH for interference into the first turn was dismissed.

 Footnotes
 HEARTY JONES came in after start, raced three wide, fell back after a half, remained wide rallying and came again to just get up. HEAR ME PURR bore
 out into first turn, raced between foes, lugged in taking the lead near furlong grounds, began to edge away and then just failed to last. PRETTY
 VENEZUELA, well placed between foes, was left with the rail and remained a factor to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. LAYLA'S VOYAGE was
 outrun early, raced between foes, was in tight near quarter pole. BREW BY YOU broke slowly, was hustled to save ground just off pace and then weakened.
 CHESSEN, very wide while just off the pace, tired. FEDERICA dueled for command between foes then had little left. TALE OF PROMISE steadied after the
 start then showed little. BLACKBIRDHASSPOKEN, very wide, was no factor. KEYSTONE JONES stalked from the three path then had nothing left.

 Footnotes
 CASTAWAY chased four wide, advanced on the turn, led into the stretch, rallied clear and lasted. AIKEN PREP broke alertly and forced the pace inside
 then continued gamely to the finish. COUNTY CORRECTIONS moved to contention into the far turn then made a gradual gain in the stretch. NEGRITO
 dropped back inside then closed well without menacing. KING DUBLIN prompted the pace outside to the stretch and weakened. DODDSPRIVATELABEL
 urged close up between rivals three wide and proved empty in the stretch. GREED IS GOOD lacked speed, was put to urging on the turn but lacked a
 response. WATCH MY DUST trailed inside, was taken up in the stretch when advancing along rail. MOTHERLAND hustled to the front inside, faltered after
 half a mile.

 Footnotes
 JESSICA KRUPNICK, between rivals early, fell back slightly and eased out near stretch, drifted in slightly while under right handed pressure after taking the
 lead, was straightened under left handed whip and edged away. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF ISABELLA SWIFT, JESSICA
 KRUPNICK WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND. ISABELLA SWIFT three wide, moved closer to the rail while opening a clear lead on the turn,
 relinquished the lead turning for home, was steadied briefly and moved to the outside near sixteenth pole and was no match late. SHE'S STUNNING broke
 slowly and awkwardly, raced well off the rail, split rivals through stretch and closed. BERTRANDA, outside and just off the pace, lacked a strong closing bid.
 RISQUE'S DIAMOND raced extremely wide and passed tiring foes. BURN CONTROL saved ground, faded through deep stretch. NATURAL WARRIOR
 broke slowly, was hustled to be well placed between foes and then faded. TIN N LINT, just off the rail and just off the early pace, tired. VANIDOSA showed
 little. SHE'S HOT WIRED, very wide, dropped back steadily.

 Footnotes
 NOBLE KENT advanced strongly outside on the final turn, quickly took over and drew away under urging before taken in hand final yards. TO THE VICTOR
 lagged far behind, rallied inside and closed well while no threat to the winner. PURIM'S GOLD allowed to settle inside, finished well through the stretch.
 BLUEGRASS DEMON chased within striking range outside then flattened out in the stretch. PICOZZA dropped behind early then passed rivals while no
 factor. BABY CAT inside early, stalked the pacesetters outside, led briefly then faded. BIG DISCOVERY broke awkwardly and lagged far behind and was
 never a factor. NICK'S POSSE broke very slowly and trailed for five furlongs and never menaced. HERE COMES GARY moved closer wide into the final
 turn then gave way. RUBLE dueled along the inside for three quarters and stopped. I AM SO JEALOUS vied outside and was finished by the far turn.
 CURLIN CRUSH urged outside off the pace then gave way readily.
