 Footnotes
 ELOSTORM stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to take command through the second turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task.
 SLOW D allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for the place. IWILLBEFIRST
 set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the second turn, then weakened late and held the show. STEVIE THE CAT well placed and
 outside, angled in through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, could not gain and held a share. J. R.'S GOOD GIRL rated back,
 tracked the pace and faded after a half. BEN AND JIGGY'S broke slightly awkwardly, was never involved.

 Footnotes
 IF YOU BELIEVE chased the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, drove clear and lasted. FUNNY
 SURPRISE well placed and three wide, gained a striking position through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. MAKING
 HISTORY allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed well for the show. LITTLE NELL passed tiring
 rivals for a share. FROSTY ZEN stalked the pace from between rivals and faded through the turn. BUBBE ZENA set the pace on the inside and had no
 stretch rally. PRIMETIME GAL was no factor.

 Footnotes
 LARA never far back, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off in the late going.
 BUSTED HANDLE well placed, looped two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly
 best of the rest. ROARING BELLE stalked the pace on the inside, came through inside of that one into the lane, weakened and held the show. DOUBLE
 THE SILK passed tiring rivals for a share. DARN THAT TRIP set the early pace on the outside and faded in the drive. AGGI'S QUEEN was a brief factor,
 inside.

 Footnotes
 SIX SIDED BLING mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch, took command, then drew off and was
 kept to the task. I WIN stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and could not gain
 the final furlong. THE UNDERSHERIFF set the pace on the inside, shook clear, stayed on when challenged in the lane, weakened late and held the show.
 MARK TWAIN passed tiring rivals for share. INVESTIGATOR rated close up, faded after a half and was vanned off. PERSIAN POET showed little, inside.
