 Footnotes
 CAPTAIN SIDNEY broke outward and bumped JOE CLOCKER, settled in range, chased four-wide into the stretch, had command in the final furlong and
 held sway under a hand ride. BAY OF RUM, bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, angled from five-wide to the second path through the turn, took the lead
 briefly in the vicinity of the eighth pole, was passed but held place. JOE CLOCKER bumped with CAPTAIN SIDNEY and BAY OF RUM leaving the gate,
 was steadied and settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, launched his rally at the top of the stretch but was involved with
 repeated bumping with LAUDERDALE through the straight but got up late for show. LAUDERDALE broke outward and settled off the pace, came three to
 five-wide through the turn, rallied outside and endured the bumping with JOE CLOCKER and was taken in hand at the wire. WESTERN GHOST stalked the
 pace, chased three-wide into the stretch then finished with determination. DANCING QUIETLY forced the pace, reached for the lead mid stretch, failed to
 draw even and gave way grudgingly. WATER POLO RACED IN mid pack, dropped back on the turn, saved ground, encountered traffic in the stretch and
 while never really clear tendered a mild late rally. MR O'PRADO led quickly, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch, yielded a furlong out
 and faded. ATLANTIC CROSSING, in mid pack early, was hustled from the rail on the turn then offered no response in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 PICTURES OF YOU led onto the main track, set a pressured pace, quickened on the turn and drew away then widened through the stretch under light
 handling. WUK UP QUEEN stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, was game but clearly second best. LA VIE
 EN ROSE moved up to press the pace on the backstretch, chased three-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. KEY RED showed brief speed then
 settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn then rallied belatedly. YES IT'S DYNA, in range, chased along the rail late turn but evened
 out in the final 16th. DISTINCT SIGNATURE settled off the pace, raced along the rail and two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but never reached
 contention. BEST DRESSED stalked early, dropped back under a ride on the turn and lacked a rally. MERCURY RISING settled in mid pack, was hustled
 four-wide on the turn then lacked a closing response.

 a reserved pace along the rail, was caught in deep stretch and failed to hold. COURT CENTRAL raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the
 turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out. THALIAS FIRE settled off the pace, was hustled angling from two to four-wide on the turn then rallied
 outside the field. GOLDEN PINEAPPLE raced in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn, chased from the top of the stretch but evened out in the late stages.
 COURT ADJOURED stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide late turn but lacked a closing response. PATMOS broke outward and was steadied, stalked
 the pace, closed along the rail late turn but flattened out in the final furlong. FLAMENCO DANCER, well back early, was hustled from the rail and two-wide
 on the turn but never reached contention. WOLVERINA'S WILLA was pulling along the rail in stalking position o the backstretch, saved ground on the turn,

 Footnotes
 HUSH BUFFY was sent to the early lead, set the pace, dashed clear on the turn then widened through the stretch under a hand ride UNDER LOCK AND
 KEY, off slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide late turn then finished under a determined drive. HOLIDEJAVU, in range, closed
 three-wide on the turn, loomed dangerous at the top of the stretch but the leader got away and she chased to the end. DUBHE, in touch, was hustled
 four-wide on the turn then finished gamely. MOLINARO DEPUTY raced in mid pack, dropped back from between rivals approaching the turn then moved to
 the outside and closed fast four-wide then rallied outside but left too much to do. BID'S KID, in mid pack early, was hustled two-wide from off the pace on
 the turn then posted a mild rally. SWEET RETREAT settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then finished gamely between foes. SPRING
 FORWARD raced from off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then closed a gap in the stretch. ZLATICA, in range, raced two to four-wide through
 the turn but lacked a closing response. SHEZ A TEN I KNOW stalked early, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but evened out mid stretch.
 CANADIAN CLUB EH forced the pace on the backstretch, stalked from the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but was empty and retreated.
 IGOTYURGRASSHOPPER broke inward and was grabbed, moved to the inside, raced in mid pack along the rail but was steadied early turn, continued to
 save ground, closed into the stretch but flattened out.

 Footnotes
 CONQUEROR GALACTUS (IRE) raced in mid pack early, was moving on the leaders while three to four wide on the turn, then bid for the lead at the eighth
 pole and held off a rival stubbornly in the drive to the wire. LEO FROM HEAVEN stalked the early pace setter and pressed that one late on the turn for the
 front, bid for the lead at the eighth pole along with the eventual winner but was out gamed to the wire in a gutsy effort. DOT'S VISION in a mid pack position
 early, ranged up two to four wide late on the turn for home and continued to inch up late in the stretch to gamely get the show spot. WHERE'S ANTHONY
 came out with the early leader and then was allowed to settle in behind the front runners and chase on the rail, was asked for best in the upper stretch but
 could not muster a challenge late and lost the show spot. FORT WISE TREATY was in the middle of the pack for the most part, then angled off the rail at
 the top of the stretch but could not pose a threat late. HEY HOWIE trailed the field until the upper stretch when angled out by the rider and found his best
 stride while widest in the final sixteenth. WAR FACTORY in mid pack into the turn before commencing a two to five wide run to the top of the stretch but his
 rally stalled at the eighth pole. BRACKET CREEP led quickly after the start, was stalked and pressed by a rival around the turn, then was collared just
 outside the eighth pole and faded badly late. HOLYSNAPENEYEBALLS was off the pace while under restraint early, then moved up inside going into the
 turn when steadied and fell back, then had no response when roused by the rider late on the turn and in the stretch.

 ZESTINA raced in mid pack, closed three-wide and lodged a bid late turn, was cleared at the top of the stretch, dug in and rebid mid stretch, gained a brief
 lead but was edged by SCARLET FLUTTER then came back again and led to the wire. SCARLET FLUTTER settled off the pace, closed angling from two to
 four-wide through the turn, challenged a furlong out and gained command but failed to hold off the determined ZESTINA. LINE OF VISION raced from off
 the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then launched a determined drive and was gaining late. LUNAR GARDEN gained a short
 early lead then drew clear, set a reserved pace, was taking pressure late turn and was challenged by ZESTINA and SAFE TO SAY, shook clear at the top of
 the stretch, was joined again mid stretch and gave way. SAFE TO SAY stalked the pace, closed two-wide and bid late turn, was cleared at the top of the
 stretch, launched an all out charge but failed to draw even and gave way. DIXIE MOON raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn, was

 Footnotes
 UNSEEN ANGELS showed early speed, cleared the field to assume control of the early pace, saved ground on the turn, drifted out a bit entering the stretch,
 dueled with BELLE DANSEUSE, kicked on as that foe failed to match strides and held off the rallying BELLA FIGURA. BELLA FIGURA bumped with
 CONQUER THE SKY at the start, was unhurried early, trailed the field on the backstretch, saved ground, began her rally approaching the 1/4 pole and
 closed well along the rail in the stretch. BELLE DANSEUSE stalked the pace while racing on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled two-wide entering
 the stretch, dueled with UNSEEN ANGELS but was outkicked in the late stages. NORTHERN FERN raced at the back early, advanced into midpack, raced
 between foes down the backstretch, was two-wide on the turn and chased down the stretch. MISS FORESTER raced in midpack, was two-wide on the turn,
 entered the stretch racing four-wide and offered a mild rally on the outside. FLASHY PATCH stalked the pace while racing on the outside, was two-wide on
 the turn and flattened out in the stretch. CONQUER THE SKY bumped with BELLA FIGURA at the start, raced in midpack on the outside early, dropped
 back to be at the rear entering the turn, raced from three to two-wide and offered no rally. SHE'S GOT FRIENDS lacked early speed, was asked midway
 around the turn and proved to be empty.
