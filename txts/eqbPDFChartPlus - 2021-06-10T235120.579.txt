 driving. DO YAHWANNA SALSA set the pace racing a few paths off the inside, drifted out a bit nearing the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch drive
 and held to earn the place spot. MR LIGHTNING BOY stalked close up racing two wide, continued between rivals on the far turn, went three wide past the
 quarter pole, bid in upper stretch, then weakened. SMOOTH STROKE raced three wide early, stalked outside, continued three wide on the far turn, then

 Footnotes
 DON'S BEACH stalked the early pacesetter, inherited the lead on the backside, remained clear into the stretch, dug in gamely and was all out hold on.
 LITTLE PAISA got loose prior and ran off, was caught soon after, raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane,
 rallied outside, was gaining late and just missed. HIGH FLYING GUY stalked the early pace, chased on the far turn and weakened in the lane. THE
 CHANCHI raced off the pace inside, lacked a rally and bested the others for the fourth spot. ARNIE THE CARNIE was bumped at the start, raced off the rail,
 off the pace and did not factor. MINERS VICTORY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, steadied slightly to avoid an injured rival at the nine
 sixteenths marker, then was outrun. SEMINOLE CHARLIE set the pace on the inside, was pulled up on the backside and vanned off.
