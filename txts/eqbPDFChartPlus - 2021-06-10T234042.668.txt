 Footnotes
 SAINT IGNATIUS bumped at the start with TIME TRACKER but was unfazed, sat well rated off the pace while on the inside, drifted out for the drive but
 rallied well and edged clear for the win. WOLFINBARGER was fractious in the gate then broke well, tracked the pace while running in the two path then
 popped off a long outside rally. WHO BROKE THE BANK ran towards the rear while going two wide around the turn while unraveling a belated rally.
 VENOMOUS STATE was very reluctant to load but broke well, dueled for the lead on the inside but was rundown by the closers. MAKE ME MONEY dueled
 for the lead on the outside going two wide around the turn then was outfinished. GAME BREAKER broke through the gate while the field was loading but
 was able to stay inside, sat well rated off the pace while on the outside, went two wide around the turn but stopped at the three eighths pole. TIME
 TRACKER bumped with SAINT IGNATIUS at the start then was shuffled back, ran towards the rear then had no response. Before the race, TIME
 TRACKER, SAINT IGNATIUS, WHO BROKE THE BANK, MAKE ME MONEY and GAME BREAKER stood in the gate for about three minutes as

 Footnotes
 DEVILKNOWSMYNAME stalked the pace while on the inside, ran all out through the stretch and edged clear. URBAN BURN had a clear lead in the early
 going but got collared quickly as the field came onto the backstretch, dug in to the challenge and kept the momentum going into the stretch but was
 outfinished. AFORTABLE went two wide around the first turn then was able to get to the inside while he tracked the pace, stayed on the inside into the
 stretch then was all out through the finish. CHASING TWILIGHT vied for the lead while going two wide around the turns, dug in when asked for more but
 was no match. CHUCKMATE stalked the pace between horses while going three wide around the turns then weakened. TOTAL FUTBOL tracked the pace
 on the outside while going three and four wide around the turns then lacked a rally. TO THE STARS went three wide around the first turn while trailing the
 field then passed tired rivals. ANDREW L went five wide around the first turn while sitting well rated off the pace, swung for home in the three path with no
 response. WHISPER TO CURLIN went five wide around the first turn then vied for the lead at the three quarters pole, was through after half a mile, turned
 for home two wide with no response.
