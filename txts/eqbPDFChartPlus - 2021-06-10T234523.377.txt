 under firm encouragement. TURBO SHAFT was rated off the second flight in the opening half, angled to the inside on the far turn and continued with
 interest inside a rival to edge that foe for the place honors late. REGAL SERENADE settled into stride off the inside, shifted out four wide into the lane and
 improved position. RENEWED ENERGY tracked inside foes in the second flight, advanced to lodge a brief bid into upper stretch but flattened out in late
 stages. LEAF BLOWER tracked between foes in second flight, then came up empty racing into upper stretch. OUTRANK pursued the pacesetter along the

 Footnotes
 RESILIENT RICK broke out bumping a rival, was righted to track off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, shifted off the inside to split foes three
 wide in upper stretch and continued with a sustained response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. MONTANA KID, bumped at the start,
 settled along the inside early, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a steady bid inside foes nearest the rail while coming up second best.
 URBAN COOL sped to the fore racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin along the inside to upper stretch but weakened leaving the
 furlong marker. STORMING THE BEACH tracked the leader inside rivals in second flight, shifted out three wide entering the lane but had no final kick. AIM
 TO TEASE settled early, angled out six wide in upper stretch but made no impact. CHAS THE MAN broke readily, tracked just off the pacesetter between
 foes in second flight, was fanned four wide into the stretch and faded. REVOLT settled outside foes early, then continued three wide between foes to the
 lane while lacking a rally. ALWAYS A CATCH tracked the leader three wide in second flight to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. FORT DIXIE,
 caught four wide racing to the backstretch, dropped out early.

 Footnotes
 BRAVE BENNY broke sharply, angled in setting the pace on a comfortable margin racing into the turn, held sway into the stretch and prevailed under
 pressure. CONGRATS GIVEN, off last, settled three deep in the last flight racing to the turn, angled six wide racing into upper stretch and produced his best
 stride to close the gap and just miss. GO BEEJA tracked between foes in second flight, advanced to challenge nearing the lane but had no final kick.
 ROYAL COMMISH tracked off the second flight four wide racing into the turn and made a steady effort in that path to late stages gaining some position.
 UNO MAS MODELO tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight, saved ground on the turn and continued evenly in late stages. INVICTUS tracked
 the leader three deep in second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. ENCHANTED RAMBAM settled between foes in the last flight early,
 shifted out five wide racing into the lane but made no impact. MR. THUNDER ducked out at the start, was settled in the last flight along the rail and proved
 no threat. MY HENRY tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages but retreated early.

 KNIGHTS NATION, reserved while angling inside in early stages, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, shifted out to split foes just off the
 inside in late stages but wrested the advantage in time under firm handling. HIGH ON SUGAR settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, continued
 unhurried to the far turn, angled seven wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to the end. HUSKY CLIPPER, in touch with the pacesetter stalking that
 rival's pace between foes under light reserve, bid between foes racing into upper stretch, exchanged repeated contact with DAR ARE WE HERE racing past
 midstretch, then drifted out into that rival's path late while prevailing for a share. CANDY CARLOS was guided to the inside early tracking just off the first
 flight to the far turn, switched out entering the lane but lacked the needed final kick. SOLAR FLAIR tracked off the second flight between foes, shifted four
 wide into the lane and continued evenly. DAD ARE WE HERE switched outside foes early while maintaining striking distance tracking the pacesetter three
 deep between foes, moved to challenge in that path racing into upper stretch while making some contact with HUSKY CLIPPER nearing midstretch, was
 bumped again by that foe while being carried out and quickly gave way. COZY KITTEN settled between foes in the last flight early and made an effort to
 gain some position along the inside in late stages. CADET CAPTAIN, urged to the lead outside foes racing to the first turn, angled inside once gaining the
 advantage, set the pace to upper stretch and gave way. HE'S DANN GOOD, forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the leaders, was urged to make a
 brief bid in that path entering the far turn, then gave way into upper stretch. ALVEAR settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and soon dropped out.

 Footnotes
 ARMANDO'S STAR broke readily, angled in sharply to join the pace outside a rival, pressed the issue outside that foe into the turn, shifted out once gaining
 the advantage in upper stretch and held the challenge of SUPERSTAR LEO under brisk right handed encouragement. The latter, came through close
 quarters in the opening stages, then shifted out four wide to gain a position just off the first flight, continued to advance three deep nearing upper stretch,
 drifted wide in upper stretch while being roused to challenge but was outkicked. CASHEL ROCK settled outside foes in the last flight early, advanced four
 wide nearing upper stretch, then angled in through the final quarter to bid inside the top pair while prevailing for a share. DR. CLARK, bumped, then
 squeezed between foes just after the start, angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn but lacked the needed final kick. BRIAR'S
 GOLD settled last in early stages, angled outside foes in upper stretch and made some belated progress. SMOKE 'N' GLOAT ducked out at the start
 bumping CAITLINS ROAD, was righted, then urged inside foes to dispute the lead inside rivals racing into the turn, dueled for a half and gave out racing into
 upper stretch. DAKOTA CANDY ducked inwards bumping DR. CLARK in the opening stages, was collected to make brief pursuit of the leaders three wide
 between foes but soon faded. CAITLINS ROAD, bumped from both sides, then squeezed back at the start, settled along the inside and lacked a rally.
 FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF DR. CLARK LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

 Footnotes
 A J'S POSSE broke sharply, angled in to set the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail and was kept to firm encouragement to maintain a safe
 margin to late stages. CHAS TOM, urged to gain a forward placing along the inside, made a brief bid inside the winner entering the stretch, then switched
 outside that rival late to prove best of the others. WAITING ON THUNDER settled along the rail racing into the bend, saved ground to upper stretch and
 made an effort to gain some position inside foes late. SOLANAIR, urged to gain a forward placing between foes prompting the pacesetter into the turn,
 pressed the issue to upper stretch and weakened late. JOCHERO, urged along four wide between foes into the turn, continued evenly in late stages.
 ASCANIUS broke awkwardly, made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide between foes into the turn but soon faded. VAN LIER, caught five wide racing into
 the turn while under pressure to contend, soon retreated. BARTBAALU proved no factor.
