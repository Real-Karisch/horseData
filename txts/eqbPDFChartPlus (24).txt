 RIVER MISS set the pace inside, shook loose again in early stretch and held a clear lead driving. HOPEFUL ANGEL broke slowly, saved ground for six
 furlongs, eased rallying and gained place. VALIANT SPIRIT prompted outside winner, drifted out through stretch and weakened. LAYLA'S VOYAGE lunged
 and broke slowly, saved ground, challenged on the final turn but failed to sustain that bid. TEARS AND ROSES raced wide while just off the pace then tired.

 Footnotes
 UNTO THOU, off slow and outrun early, weaved through traffic on the final turn angled to the outside in early stretch and finished with a flourish to get the
 nod. SNOWFLY also broke slowly, raced outside winner early, angled out into the stretch, took the lead and began to edge away but was unable to last.
 SPEEDY A. P. raced wide while unhurried, challenged near mid stretch but then flattened out. ALAN'S LEGACY, outside and just off the pace, remained a
 factor to deep stretch and then weakened. SIGNATURE HEART rallied very wide on the far turn, took the lead near mid stretch then gave way. SUNSHINE
 WILD saved ground and tired. SALLISAW prompted the pace from the rail then tired. CHAMPAGNE CHUCK, three wide while just off the pace, gave way.
 OFFLEE CLOUDY had speed for a half mile. STARRY MESSENGER set the pace two wide, stopped suddenly.
