 EYES ON ME settled outside, rallied four wide around the turn, took over from the outside leaving the furlong grounds and drew out after five furlongs.
 AMI'S EXCHANGE was never far back, moved to vie two wide between horses on the turn but couldn't stay with the winner in the lane. SANCHO DEL
 PUEBLO steadied in tight between horses soon after the break, was sent to a short lead after going a furlong, stayed inside while making the way into the
 stretch then weakened. MAD DREAMER steadied in tight three wide between horses early on the turn then weakened. C. VICTOR wasn't far back early,
 raced two wide between horses around the turn then tired. COPPERHEAD steadied along the rail midway on the turn and failed to menace. THORN HILL
 CAT was fractious in the gate then broke slowly and was outrun. EASY BREATHING bobbled leaving the gate, recovered to make the early pace then was
 finished before a half.
