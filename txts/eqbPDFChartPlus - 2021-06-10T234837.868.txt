 Footnotes
 REDHOT KATIE raced well off inside, took over, dueled, cleared in the stretch and held sway in the final sixteenth. CANTALOUPE ISLAND unhurried early,
 went to chase with a good finish while well clear of rest at the finish. TURKICANUS FREAK troubled trip from the half to quarter pole, rallied wide for the
 show spot. SETTLE A SCORE bunched up on the backstretch with no late kick in the stretch. HIDDEN STRENGTH speed to duel for a half, gave way
 readily thereafter. TIPSY TIME turned in a dull effort. PRETTY PENNY never far back to the half, failed to fire from that point. MADABOUTHER never
 factored. DORSET DANCER through early, dropped far back. ATALANTA BELLE through after half, dropped back.

 chased the pace early, shifted into the four path in the far turn, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. TESTY KITTEN was unprepared at
 the start and raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane, led the field from the inside in the stretch but yielded late in the drive. HALF OF
 MANHATTAN stalked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. HEART IN HAND set the pace early, was on the
 inside into the lane and faltered in the stretch drive. JINGLE ME THIS was through after a half. AULD CUP was never a threat. ROLLIN SMOKE had early

 on, shifted into the three path in the far turn, made a bid in the stretch, split horses near the eighth pole but hung in the final stages. ARIAN RAE tracked the
 pace early, shifted into the three path in the far turn, led the field shortly down the lane and yielded in the late stages. POSITIVE VIBES was slow at the
 start, trailed the field from the inside, checked while in tight along the inside near the seven sixteenths pole, shifted into the four path entering the lane and
 moved up late. ABSOLUTE LOVE chased the pace early, shifted into the four path in the far turn while making a bid, drifted out and bothered HYDRA'S

 JEANNIE'S BEEPBEEP dueled early on, was off the rail into the lane, inched clear in the stretch, was put under a long drive late and prevailed in the final
 stages. URBAN INSIGHT bobbled at the start, chased the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, was under a long drive in the stretch and was
 outfinished in the final stages. OUR SNOWFLAKE stalked the pace early, shifted into the three path in the turn and flattened out late in the stretch run.
 ADHERETOME dueled early on, was on the inside into the lane and faltered in the stretch drive. INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ tracked the pace early, was off the rail
 into the lane and faded in the stretch. STOLEN BEAUTY was through after a half. MARCIE'S CANDY was never a factor. DEL MAR BABE came out at the
 start and was done early. WHISKARITA showed little.
