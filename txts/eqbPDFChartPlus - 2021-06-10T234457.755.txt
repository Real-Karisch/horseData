 Footnotes
 SMART DUDE vied for lead in initial stages then took command by comfortable margin, continued to lead the way just off the inside entering the lane, came
 under steady encouragement and held clear. TRES HUEVOS vied for lead in initial stages then continued to chase up close in the turn, set down driving two
 to three wide in lane, could not reach eventual winner but produced solid effort throughout. SAL'S JET hustled up along rail in the turn then shifted out
 turning for home, set down driving at head of the lane and finished with good response. WILDCAT SAINT vied for lead in opening stages then continued up
 close behind leader, sent driving into lane then lacked needed kick to move on. RORY got brushed at the start then hustled up along outside racing
 midpack, roused three wide upper stretch then shifted out wider and continued steady even bid. TIME WILL TELL broke in and hit gate at the start, angled
 to rail exiting the turn then roused two to three wide without making late impact. BODHI DOG brushed with rival at the start then hustled up along inside,
 failed to kick on. GODS GREATNESS was sent hard from outside at the start, raced in contention then weakened midway through the turn. YOU ARE
 FLATTER shifted to far outside just after the start, raced very wide leaving the backstretch, continued wide trip to no avail. MOONSTRICKING showed early
 response and raced along rail three furlongs out, could not sustain bid and faded.

 Footnotes
 LAWLESS LADY broke alertly and was content to draft along behind SOMEWHATOPTIMISTIC to the turn, swung four wide approaching the stretch,
 reached the front near the sixteenth-pole, and held off BODY HIGH in the last strides. BODY HIGH was bumped by SOMEWHATOPTIMISTIC into ADIOS
 MIA several strides after the start, made no headway despite being scrubbed on three then four wide on the turn, came five wide with a grinding rally, and
 ran out of time. SOMEWHATOPTIMISTIC came in after the start bumping BODY HIGH into ADIOS MIA, was sent hard for the lead inside, maintained a
 slight advantage to midstretch as LAWLESS LADY challenged, but weakened in the late stages. EMAIL led through the opening strides, chased outside the
 pacesetter two to three wide to the top of the stretch, and had no late kick while moving over to the rail late. ADIOS MIA was bumped by BODY HIGH and
 forced in soon after the start, stayed on the rail throughout and did not menace. BANDIDA RAGS hesitated at the break to spot the field two or three
 lengths, and trailed throughout.

 ADMIRABLE KISS raced three wide through the backstretch tracking early pace, edged up and took narrow lead midway through the turn still unasked,
 roused for more at head of the lane, responded willingly three wide and pulled away. ROGUE PATRIOT sat off pace in early stages then loomed up boldly
 three wide midway through turn, lost the whip leaving the quarter pole, could not move on with eventual winner but continued steady outside bid for second
 best. NEW CHAMPION sped to lead and cleared on top, challenged in the turn and lost the lead to eventual winner, kept on along inside in the lane and
 finished well clear over rest. CAPT. OVERDRIVE came away last at the start, raced four wide through the backstretch then continued outside trip to no
 avail. FIGHT ON FOREVER hustled up at the start and moved up rail to race in close contention, could not keep up pace in the turn, retreated.

 Footnotes
 SHEPUTASPELLONME bumped with PSYCHO GIRL at the start, tucked in nicely behind the leaders, came off the inside approaching the stretch, rallied
 through the lane and caught NICKY'S WARRIOR from the outside to be along in time. BAYLOR raced two wide on the turns, split horses at the top of the
 stretch, and again in midstretch, and finished gamely to get up for second at the wire. NICKY'S WARRIOR pressed the pace outside SOL DAT SUGAR from
 the start, got the best of that rival and came away with the lead in upper stretch, then drifted out after the rider lost the whip past the eighth-pole and
 weakened. OUR AMAZING GRACE trailed after breaking slowly, put in a good rail run around the far turn, split horses a furlong out and finished willingly in
 some traffic toward the inside. PSYCHO GIRL bumped with SHEPUTASPELLON ME at the start, saved ground early, raced three wide on the far turn, and
 gained mildly outside late. SOL DAT SUGAR tugged her way to the backstretch with the lead, responded when challenged from the outside by NICKY'S
 WARRIOR, and fought on to the furlong grounds before giving way. RIGEL'S HALO was keyed up and difficult to handle between horses in early traffic,
 saved ground to late on the far turn, came off the rail at the quarter-pole and lacked a late kick. KITTEN OF THE NILE bumped with TEQUILA N TACOS at
 the start, raced three wide much of the way and posed no threat. SHE'S NO JOKE raced toward the inside and was outrun. TEQUILA N TACOS bumped
 with KITTEN OF THE NILE at the start, moved to contention four wide up the backstretch, and faded through the stretch. BLUE WHALE made little
 headway four to five wide on the far turn, and tired. ESTELLE'S IN TOWN was forwardly placed early three wide, and remained in range to far turn before
 coming up empty.

 Footnotes
 CHARGE CARD got brushed between rivals at the start then settled off top flight racing outside of STAR JUANCHO past the half mile marker, steadily
 inched way up closer then roused three wide at the quarter pole, sent driving into lane, raced on equal terms top stretch, dug in gamely to gain advantage
 then drew away. WHAT'S INSIDE lost some footing at the start then was firmly rated off pace in early stages, let out notch along outside near the quarter
 pole, fanned out top stretch and dug in near the lead but could not kick on with eventual winner, solid effort for second best. STAR JUANCHO vied for lead
 along inside of R SERCRET LIFE in opening stages then edged back and raced off top pair positioned inside of eventual winner leaving the backstretch,
 waited along rail near the quarter pole then came out five wide for the drive, was no late match for top pair but kept on and regained share. FORTUNE
 COOKIE raced off early pace, shifted outside top stretch and continued steady even bid just missing show. JALEN HURTS got brushed back at the start
 then lacked early speed, hustled up along outside at head of the lane, lacked needed response for late impact. R SECRET LIFE got brushed at the start
 then held narrow lead over STAR JUANCHO in opening stages then dueled for lead with SCOTUSCARE, took on added challengers near the quarter pole,
 battled back top stretch then weakened. SCOTUSCARE broke in at the start then continued getting in bit through backstretch, dueled for lead in the turn
 then failed to keep up pace and retreated in final furlong.

 ARCHITECTURAL came out early tightening things up on two rivals to his outside, moved up three wide to go after UNCLE MACE into the turn, reached
 even terms from outside at the top of the lane, finally disposed of the pacesetter in deep stretch, then held off late challenges gamely. VISIONS OF YOU
 bumped with WAHOOWAH at the start, raced close-up inside, steadied in tight lacking room behind UNCLE MACE at the top of the stretch, gained
 clearance in the three-path after straightening away and finished well between horses. WAHOOWAH bumped with VISIONS OF YOU at the start, then
 bumped with MISS PADDY, was outsprinted early two wide, came four wide into the lane and gained rapidly late on the far outside. UNCLE MACE sped to
 the early lead inside, responded when hooked by ARCHITECTURAL turning for home, and battled to deep stretch on the rail before yielding. TWO
 SEVENTY ONE came in after the start bumping MISS PADDY, had his heels clipped by that one soon after, saved ground around the turn, was pinned to
 the fence by SALUTE AND SERVE in upper stretch, found room passing the furlong grounds and finished with good energy in late traffic directly behind the
 winner. DOMENIC bumped with LOVINGRDSIMMAR at the start, steadied in tight between horses early, stayed in range three wide to the stretch and was
 outkicked. SALUTE AND SERVE raced up close two wide between horses on the turn, kept TWO SEVENTY ONE bottled up in upper stretch, then lacked
 the needed response. MISS PADDY was pinched back getting bumped from both sides at the break, clipped heels behind TWO SEVENTY ONE causing
 the rider to lose the left iron, had the rider regain the iron near the turn, and made no headway. STUN raced two then three wide on the turn, and was no
 factor. LOVINGRDSIMMAR bumped with TIZ A FACTOR, then with DOMENIC a stride later after the start, raced two wide and was outrun. G T'S
 GRAEMIE was put in tight quarters early and steadied between horses, and was outrun four wide into the stretch. TIZ A FACTOR bumped with
 LOVINGRDSIMMAR at the start, raced forwardly four wide to the turn, and dropped back steadily after three furlongs. Internal fractions unavailable

 Footnotes
 EMPEROR JOHN bumped with TRIO OF CHAMPIONS at the start, pressed the pace between horses to the turn, drifted wide at the top of the stretch and
 again while driving clear to the eighth-pole, then was hand-ridden the last sixteenth of a mile. ENDURING ARCH was outsprinted to the stretch, rallied
 between horses coming to the sixteenth pole and was along for second while never a threat. STONE MOUNTAIN bumped with DEVILISH MAN at the start,
 prompted the pace from outside, was floated out a bit by EMPEROR JOHN near the three-sixteenths marker, could not keep pace with that one through
 midstretch and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. TRIO OF CHAMPIONS came out running despite bumps from both sides at the start, made the pace
 well off the rail early, gradually moved inward near the turn, could not cope with EMPEROR JOHN turning for home, and tired on the rail. DIXIE MAMBO hit
 the gate, then steadied after breaking outward and bumping TRIO OF CHAMPIONS, and was never in the hunt. DEVILISH MAN bumped with STONE
 MOUNTAIN at the start, showed brief speed while moving inward up the backstretch, dropped back drifting wide off the turn, and was not persevered with in
 the stretch.

 ARCH DADDY was well rated taken off pace and positioned along outside, settled nicely under riders command then swung into action racing wide at head
 of the lane, steadily moved closer inside, kicked by with good response and kept clear under driving finish. BERNAY (IRE) was unhurried at the start moved
 in closer from outside position, raced two path in back going through the backstretch, swung to far outside at head of the lane, lost some ground then
 finished strongly. CULTURE CARRIER raced near the back and saved ground along inside, continued along rail in final turn then raced in traffic at head of
 the lane, maneuvered way through and finished with good kick. ENGLISH ILLUSION stalked along inside then roused for more along rail leaving final turn,
 moved up in striking range then steadied, lost some momentum and evened out. J R 'S HOLIDAY set pressured pace, continued to lead the way into stretch
 then came up empty in final furlong. JAGR was rated in range positioned along outside, continued in close range leaving the backstretch for final time then
 loomed up to threaten in final turn, continued driving at head of the lane then gaveway. SNAG raced near midpack under snug hold, hustled up between
 rivals at the quarter pole then failed to move on in the lane. NILE PRINCE applied pressure to the leader throughout early stages, launched bid to reach
 equal terms with rival in final turn, could not reach top spot then came up tired in the lane. race was hand timed

 Footnotes
 ARCELOR edged closer to the leaders around the turn, came three wide into the lane, caught COQUIVACOA from the outside with a sixteenth of a mile to
 go and drove clear. COQUIVACOA set the pace along the inside, repelled a challenge from MAKING HAVOC on the turn, kept on stubbornly as ARCELOR
 ranged up alongside, and yielded late. PURE BLISS was guided off the inside approaching the turn, rallied outside ARCELOR past the quarter-pole, could
 not kick on with that one and lasted for a share of third. MAKING HAVOC pressed the pace and bid outside COQUIVACOA around the turn, was outmoved
 through upper stretch, then came back on gamely inside PURE BLISS to finish on even terms for the show. MILBRA was forced in and steadied at the start,
 raced two wide around the turn and did not factor. FIORE was forced in at the start, raced three wide and tired. INDOMINUS broke in at the start causing
 crowding, and was outrun while wide. SOLFATARA hopped up at the break and was away behind the field, steadied inside ARCELOR heading into the turn,
 and never reached contention.

 Footnotes
 DAWN LIGHTNING was well rated racing up close along inside, continued along rail then guided out turning for home, roused two path, hustled up to move
 up then by RAHY MOMENTA in final furlong then jumped tracks and came out. RAHY MOMENTA sped to lead at the start then briefly challenged by
 LAGUNA DREAM before shaking away to take back clear command, continued to lead the way into stretch, got outkicked for win by DAWN LIGHTNING
 and secured runner up spot. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN raced off speed in opening stages then steadily moved up closer along rail after entering the turn,
 waited for racing room near the quarter pole then angled out two path and finished well clear over rest. SLATED raced in range along outside in opening
 stages, continued outside bid at head of the lane then began drifting in while tiring in final furlong. NOTHINS FREE bumped with rival at the start then
 chased up close four wide in opening stages, continued in close range then dropped to rail leaving turn, had no kick left in late reserve. REBA'S RIGHT got
 slammed back at the start, lost ground in the field, then hustled up along inside in turn then three wide at head of lane and finished on equal terms with
 APAIXONADA. APAIXONADA raced in range along outside then steadily weakened in the turn. MICROCHIP raced along outside throughout without
 threatening. DUQUESITA DE ALBA lacked speed and failed to rally. LAGUNA DREAM got brushed at the start then hustled up and briefly vied for the lead,
 could not sustain bid through turn, retreated. Race was hand timed
