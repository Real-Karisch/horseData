 Footnotes
 DIVA CHICK was well placed along the three path, moved to challenge on that path nearest the rail into the final turn, battled in the lane to the line and got
 the job done. SPICY LEGS broke sluggishly, five wide up the backstretch, challenged five wide outside rivals on the last turn, battled to the line and missed.
 CHICA ZOOM was unhurried along the two path, continued on that path into the lane and made a mild bid. BLUEGRASS HIP HOP vied for the lead early,
 tracked, dropped back some four wide on the last turn, angled out and weakened. MILLYMILLYBOBILLY away best, set the pace along the three path into
 the backstretch, vied after that from between on the last turn and weakened. SHE MY TRAP QUEEN five wide on the turns and tired. DUE TO A
 MALFUNCTION ON THE TOTE BOARD CONCERNING THE ONE MILE TIME AND FINAL TIME WERE INCORRECT BUT CORRECT ON THE TV
 MONITORS THROUGHOUT.

 Footnotes
 SMART THINKING Away best, set the pace four wide into the backstretch, continued four wide contesting the lead after a half mile, drifted out through the
 late stages under left handed urging bothering AMERICAN ROAD late and outran that one to the line. AMERICAN ROAD Vied five wide after a half mile,
 four wide on the last turn, matched strides in the lane and then was bothered late by the winner and just missed. GUYANA CAT In hand along the three path
 around the turns, angled wide and rallied. FIVE FREEDOMS Broke sluggishly, lagged back, two path on the final bend and failed to take part. FLETCHER
 IS GOLDEN Saved ground on the turns and tired. PATRIOT STAR Was well placed four wide on the turns and tired. A claim of foul was lodged by the rider
 of AMERICAN ROAD against the winner for interference in deep stretch, resulted in the disqualification of SMART THINKING from first to second. DUE TO
 A MALFUNCTION ON THE TOTE BOARD, THE FINAL TIME WAS INCORRECT BUT CORRECT ON ALL TV MONITORS THROUGHOUT.
