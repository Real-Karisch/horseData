 Footnotes
 IMA CAT GENIUS broke out at the start then corrected course and gave chase on the outside, took the turn in the three path, then drove down the stretch
 under light handling and took over in later yards. LET FREEDOM RING broke in and bumped Blue Plaid at the start then gave chase well off the pace on
 the outside, rounded the turn in the three path, then gained down the lane, coming out a path off the heels of Ima Cat Genius, and was quickly closing on
 the winner. BLUE PLAID was bumped at the start by Let Freedom Ring, then chased the pace from the inside, took over near the three-eighths pole and
 rounded the turn on the rail, then dug in gamely down the stretch, was caught in later yards, and leveled off. LIL LINDER gave chase well off the pace
 inside, rounded the turn on the rail, then moved to the outside leaving the turn and flattened out in the stretch. PECK'S BAD BOY rushed up to set the early
 pace on the outside, was caught approaching the three-eighths pole, then dropped back through the turn on the rail and faded; was eased in the final
 sixteenth.

 MORE ABUNDANCE gave chase two wide between horses early, raced around the turn in the four path, drew to near even terms approaching the eighth
 pole and was carried out to the eleven path leaving the turn, then took over past the eighth pole and drew off. TRUE MAGIC battled to the front to set the
 pace inside, drew clear near the three-eighths pole and rounded the turn in the three path, was met at near even terms approaching the eighth pole and
 came out to about the nine path leaving the turn, was caught just past the eighth pole and leveled off. SHAMROCK GREEN hit the gate at the start then
 gave chase on the outside, rounded the turn in the four path, then raced down the stretch and finished evenly. HIGH DREAMER gave chase well back
 toward the inside but eased out through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the four path, then ducked in sharply mid-stretch and finished evenly.
 WILLFUL LIMIT was never a factor. LETS DANCE JACK raced in contention on the outside early, but began fading near the three-eighths pole.

 Footnotes
 SAINTE THERESE steadied between horses leaving the gate then stalked the pace from the two and three paths, challenged approaching the seven
 sixteenths pole, took the nod nearing the five sixteenths, edged clear past the quarter then widened under steady encouragement. CAPE DELIGHT surged
 to the lead and angled in leaving the thirteen sixteenths pole, moved to the rail into the first turn to rate the pace, was pressured nearing the seven
 sixteenths pole, ceded the nod toward the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail into the far turn and proved no match for the winner. MONEY PITCH
 rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths then settled off the pace four wide into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole but
 showed little further in the stretch. STARSHIP SUPERGIRL rated close through the front stretch and raced boxed in through the opening turn, started a bid
 toward the far turn but was hemmed in there as well and had little left in the stretch. ARK OFTHE COVENANT rated close in the three path the opening turn,
 angled to the outside entering the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and had little left after rounding the far turn in the four path.

 GOOD GENES gave chase inside, was boxed in past the three-eighths pole and eased out at the five-sixteenths pole to steadily improve through the turn in
 the five path, drew to near even terms approaching the eighth pole, then drove down the lane under an aggressive hand ride and came up first near the
 sixteenth pole, and widened to the wire. THE GREAT MCHENRY pressured the pace on the outside and took over near the five-sixteenths pole, enjoyed a
 very slim, brief lead before being caught past the five-sixteenths pole, took the turn in the three path and assumed the lead again approaching the eighth
 pole, but was caught near the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. ASP gave chase on the outside and took over past the five-sixteenths pole, rounded the
 turn in the five path, then was caught approaching the eighth pole and leveled off in the stretch. BROKENCALL set a pressured pace inside, was caught
 near the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn on the rail, then raced down the lane nearest the rail and finished evenly. BIG DISTINCTION gave chase
 two wide between horses and raced around the turn in the three path, then flattened out at the finish. BLOGOSPHERE gave chase three wide between
 horses but showed little.

 Footnotes
 CAPTAIN CHAOS exchanged early contact with El Cupido then quickly took control to rate the pace, moved to the rail into the opening turn, was pressured
 toward the five sixteenths pole, drifted leaving the far turn but dug in under steady encouragement, when straightened away, and held on well.
 AMATTEROFTIME settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took aim at the drifting winner in the upper stretch
 but was turned back through later yards. HIGH NOON LUTE raced well back saving ground and appeared off stride early, bid approaching the three eighths
 pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then couldn't gain in the stretch. EL CUPIDO exchanged early contact with Captain Chaos then rated close inside
 through the front stretch, angled to the two path into the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail
 and weakened. AMBITION MISSION became a bit edgy in the gate, settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole but showed little
 response.

 Footnotes
 BADUKE angled in to rate a pressured pace inside, was met at near even terms at the seven-sixteenths pole and engaged in a short duel, rounded both
 turns on the rail and drew off through the far turn, then was tapped twice in the upper stretch and widened through the final sixteenth under an aggressive
 hand ride. GOODBYESEEULATER pressured the pace on the outside, drew to near even terms at the seven-sixteenths pole for a short duel, dropped back
 past the three-eighths pole, then rounded the far turn in the three path and was outfinished. ROCKHOPPER PENGUIN, saving ground into the first turn,
 settled well back inside, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole and took both turns on the rail, then dug in determinedly in the stretch, gaining, to finish
 evenly. SCHLOSSER was pinched back at the start and settled close off the pace on the outside, made a bid past the three-eighths pole and rounded the
 turn in the four path, then moved to the outside leaving the turn and finished widest. ROCKET ROAD settled close off the pace inside, was steadied off the
 inside flank of Baduke moving into the far turn, and never regained momentum. KATMAN QUICK was blocked at the heels of Baduke going into the first turn
 and was never a factor.

 HANDSOME HUNT angled in to stalk the pace three wide, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the head of the lane,
 drifted leaving the far turn but dug in and drew off the final sixteenth. DADO'S DREAM raced boxed at the rail the opening turn and settled off the pace into
 the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and eased out from that point, rounded the far turn in the three path then dug in through the lane to take
 second in late yards. KING OF BLUES rated the pace inside, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, headed at the rail nearing the head of the lane,
 continued close through the upper stretch then flattened stride the final sixteenth. MINI BOLT saved ground well off the pace the opening turn, eased out
 into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the six path and had little left. MAKANA rated close in the four path the
 opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then weakened in the stretch. FIRE ENGINE RED broke in steadying
 and was not a factor. ACCESS TO DENIS stalked the pace two deep while between horses most of the opening turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths
