 IMAGINE IF was rated between foes in the second flight racing to the far turn, moved to challenge three deep nearing upper stretch, took over and drove
 clear. ANGELNAULE, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking off the first flight, advanced to challenge outside foes racing into the far turn, gained
 a brief advantage but proved no match when confronted by the winner. TROLLEY, urged to terms with the first flight three wide prompting the pace, dueled
 between, then inside foes into the far turn and gave way along the inside leaving midstretch. SE FUE, reserved last in the opening stages, passed only tiring
 rivals. LADY BABAKO, urged between foes pressing the pace racing to the backstretch, gave way on the far turn. FIRST EMBRACE, urged to gain a
 forward placing along the inside, tracked just off the leaders into the far turn and steadily faded. FLIRTWITHTHEDEVIL made brief pursuit of the leaders
 along the inside but soon dropped out.

 KISSES FOR SIDNEY, urged to terms pressing the pace three wide in the opening stages, dueled outside a rival into upper stretch and edged forward
 under firm encouragement. WHISKEY LEGEND, forwardly placed along the inside stalking just off the leaders, switched out into upper stretch and proved
 best of the others. ACADEMIC BAY broke out bumping a rival, settled into stride, steadily advanced along the inside into the turn, shifted out four nearing
 midstretch and continued willingly to close the gap. PRINCESS SUNRISE, urged to dispute the pace between foes, then along the inside racing into the
 turn, gave way midstretch. BLINKERSONLETHERIP, off a step slow, was hustled between foes to position in the second flight and continued evenly late.
 NO BLING tracked the leaders along the inside racing into the bend but lacked the needed late response. SUE DANCER, caught five wide racing to the
 turn, offered no rally. CABALLO'S ROSE proved no factor. CUP O' TEA FOR ME, bumped at the start, never menaced. TWISTED BY FATE angled to the
 rail dropping well off the pace and failed to menace. VALENTINE CHRISTIE broke slowly and never menaced. VICTORY TOPPER flashed brief pace four
 wide in pursuit of the leaders but soon gave way.

 Footnotes
 MORE ON TAP showed good speed out of the gate to set the pace on the inside, engaged a prolonged skirmish for the lead on the backstretch, dispatched
 rival past the quarter pole and battled back gamely on the inside to hold off foe in the final yards. VANDERBILT BEACH tracked the pacesetters while
 traveling three wide through the first turn, prompted at the quarter pole under right-handed pressure, improved position in the lane, led briefly but was
 outkicked in the final strides. JAM N ADDY forced the pace on the outside of aforementioned rival, weakened past the quarter pole and held on for a share.
 HIGH SIDE tracked the pace on the inside and failed to menace. BORN FORCE tracked the pace between rival early, angled out three wide far turn and
 failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 HALF A GO GO was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch, then was roused to turn back a rival's
 challenge to go clear late. GENITHELAMBORGHINI, rated just out of striking distance four wide between foes in the opening stages, readily advanced on
 his own courage in that path on the turn, drew on terms with the winner nearing midstretch but couldn't match strides with that rival late. FEISTY TOMBOY
 was guided to the inside early, saved ground racing into the turn and, improved position while no menace to the top pair. TIZ THE STORM, urged to press
 the pace between foes racing into the turn, gave way after a half. DIALMYNUMBER, off slowly, recovered quickly to gain a forward placing three deep
 racing to the turn but gave way racing into upper stretch. DERBY DANCE, rated five deep in the opening stages, offered no rally.
