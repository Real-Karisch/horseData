 Footnotes
 CHELIOS was unhurried early and raced wide, circled into the stretch and took over after five furlongs to win going away in handy fashion. BEAR CLAUSE
 showed speed from the outset then was no match for the winner. SIENA INDIAN broke sharp and showed the way into the final furlong then weakened.
 GITIDONE was forwardly placed then flattened out in the drive. SUNNY PUZZLE lacked a rally. GETUP STAYUP tired from his early effort.
 HOWBOUTTHEMCOWBOYS was through early.

 Footnotes
 DISCOMANIA quickly went to the lead, set the pace racing off the inside rail and was under steady pressure to hod off the challenge of YOU'RE DREAMIN.
 YOU'RE DREAMIN was well placed within easy striking distance, loomed boldly outside the winner through the stretch and lacked the needed closing kick.
 WATEREE moved closer on the far turn then finished best of the others. STAR OF MIDNIGHT prompted the pace, drifted very wide leaving the far turn then
 weakened in the drive. A PRINCESS SHE IS broke a step slowly then failed to threaten. WEE BONNIE LASS lacked a rally. WITH WINGS hopped at the
 start and was carried wide on the far turn. FLASHY SIREN showed little. FLOWERS FROM TONY tired. BLONDY BEACH was through early.

 ANITA LASS chased racing in the five path, was carried wider leaving the turn, took the lead near sixteenth pole and edged away. HURRICANE JOSIE,
 three wide while never far back, fell back in mid stretch, was carried out wider and was along for place. SPRING MISCHIEF set the pace in the four path,
 drifted out on the turn and through stretch and faded. SISTER WENDY gradually angled towards the rail and failed to menace. MISS STAR LO split rivals
 on the turn and through stretch but was no factor. FAIR LADY SADIE avoided geese in the opening furlong, gave way leaving the turn. PHILJANGLE, very
 wide, showed little. PAMPLONA MISS, outrun in the five path, never threatened.

 SEAT OF HONOR took the lead soon after the start, set the pace in four path, shook loose to be clear mid stretch, drifted out badly deep stretch and held
 on. QUALITY ASSET, in the three path, steadied lacking room near quarter pole, continued inside through stretch and closed. SIGHT LINE, just off the rail,
 moved between in stretch, was forced out into SPEAKER JOHN and gained the show spot. SPEAKER JOHN, outside and just off the pace, drifted wider
 into stretch, was bumped in deep stretch. CONQUEST KRONOS prompted the pace outside winner, drifted out under left handed pressure forcing SIGHT
 LINE INTO SPEAKER JOHN then tired. SNOWFLY, wide, never threatened. SKEET SHOT, between foes, failed to menace.
