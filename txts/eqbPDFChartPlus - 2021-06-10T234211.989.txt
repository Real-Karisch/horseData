 ALLURING APPROVAL dueled for a half, shook free entering the stretch and drew clear under stout handling. HIDATSA PARK trailed early on, rallied up
 rail through the stretch for the place in a good effort. LIBERTY FIRE well placed while never far back, mild bid through the stretch but flattened out for show.
 MINE AT LAST vied from two path to the turn but weakened in the stretch run. SILVER STARLIGHT vied from three path to the turn but, weakened in the
 drive. HOLY TEMPLE raced a wide trip while never a threat. PARADE FOR ME dueled inside to the turn but stopped readily thereafter. DESERT MARIA
 never a factor.
