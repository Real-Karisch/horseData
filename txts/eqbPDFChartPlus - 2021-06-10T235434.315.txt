 Footnotes
 ANNOTIS away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch,
 took control entering the final turn while racing one out from the rail, and was all out to prevail from between rivals late, while drifting in slightly approaching
 the wire. SEVEN CHANCES broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside through the
 final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to just miss. LOOKOUT TAYLOR hopped at the start to get away slowly, raced into a stalking trip two
 wide entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive,
 before steadying sharply when put in tight quarters at the rail in deep stretch. SISU unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied smartly two out from
 the rail entering the final turn, and closed with late interest two wide in the drive. LA REVE was off a step slow, but recovered quickly to press the pacesetter
 two wide entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on the leaders while racing two out from
 the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive. ASPIRED tracked the leader three wide entering the first turn, rallied two out from the rail
 entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response late while finishing three out from the rail. PORTO RICAN QUEEN away well and tracked the
 leaders two wide entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact while finishing at the rail in the
 drive. TOO HOT TO HANDLE stalked the leaders three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, but failed to respond when called
 upon. Following the running of this race there was both a stewards inquiry as well as a rider's claim of foul. The rider of LOOKOUT TAYLOR lodged a claim
 of foul against the riders of ANNOTIS and SEVEN CHANCES for alleged interference in mid stretch. After review the stewards the stewards disqualified
 ANNOTIS from first and placed this horse third for causing the interference to LOOKOUT TAYLOR

 ALL UNDER CONTROL broke sharply and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run to the final turn
 while racing just out from the rail, rallied along the inside through the turn, and drew clear in the stretch drive under confident handling. PEACE ARCH away

 the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from
 along the rail in the drive in a solid effort. IGOR settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering he

 BROTHER ROD broke sharply and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run
 down the backstretch, engaged the leader while commencing his bid three wide entering the final turn, and prevailed over a stubborn rival following a stretch
 long battle. IAMA BETTER CAUSE away well and vied for the lead while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace
 from just off the rail in the run down the backstretch, was collared by BROTHER ROD entering the final turn, and just missed following a stretch long battle
 with that rival. CHASE THE MONEY tracked the leader from along the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide through the final turn, and
 closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. TORNIADOR away alertly and tracked the leader three out from the rail through the stretch
 the first time, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive in an even effort. TIMBER KING stalked the early pace
 while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the
 stretch drive. FAMOUS WINNER settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two out from the rail
 entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact while closing two wide in the drive. THREE BERRY hopped at the start to get away poorly, settled
