 SHOT GUN GARY sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace and held FASHION PROSPECT at bay throughout. FASHION PROSPECT
 was bumped at the break, chased the winner while racing five-wide, could not reach that foe in the drive but finished willingly. SIERRA ROMANCE lagged
 early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. MYSTIC WOOD FORCE broke out, settled off the leaders early,
 raced off the rail through the turn and failed to rally. KNOWN DEFENSE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further
 approaching the stretch and did not menace.

 Footnotes
 SALTY MINNOW was away in good order to duel for the lead with CRUSHING CANDY while racing four-wide, disposed of that rival after going six furlongs,
 opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority. UNCLE KIMO was reserved just off the leaders early, raced five-wide through the
 second turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain on the winner late. TIZ JOLIE broke awkwardly, was unhurried early, raced four-wide through the
 second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. CRUSHIN CANDY broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing
 three-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. QUE CHISTOSO raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and lacked
 the needed rally. WOOD MACHINE settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. CLASSY COVE raced off the leaders from the inside
 throughout and did not threaten. ROYAL TALE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. RYAN WALT raced
 five-wide through both turns, lacked early foot and did not offer a bid.
