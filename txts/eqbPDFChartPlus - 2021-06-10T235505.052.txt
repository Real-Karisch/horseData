 leaving the quarter pole then dug in late to hold second. LOVE SOLUTION chased the top two while off the rail, tried to rally in the two path on the second

 CLEAN LIVING was away in good order and contested the pace outside of TOTALLY UPBEAT, dueled three wide to mid turn, edged away to the stretch
 then held under steady urging. SCOTT'S BEST BETH chased the leaders three wide to the stretch, was no threat to the winner but bested the others.
 DIAMANTE APPEAL was also chasing inside SCOTT'S BEST BETH, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. FILINA was outrun to
 the turn, came three wide to the stretch and finished evenly. LITTLE MISS HOTTIE broke about five lengths last and lost any chance. TOTALLY UPBEAT
 hustled to duel inside the winner and off the rail, got outrun leaving the three eighths pole and gave way in the drive. THE HALF MILE FRACTION WAS
 HAND-TIMED.

 DOLE OUT THE DOUGH was on the pace from the outset while in the three path, remained three deep dueling on the second turn then dug in gamely and
 got the nod. GIMME SPACE was outside the winner and four wide on the pace to the stretch, battled determinedly and just missed. AERIAL DECOY was
 chasing to the second turn, got forced out to the five path to the stretch then finished in a mild rally. GABRIEL was outrun to the backstretch, settled to the
 second turn, raced two wide and moved closer to mid stretch but got outfinished in the final sixteenth. KAPALUA BAY stalked the pace to the second turn
 but was forced to circle six wide to the stretch and faded in the final furlong. SHINER'S CODE had no speed and was never a threat.

 Footnotes
 SIENNA hustled to the front, set the pace three deep to the stretch, met the bid from JUST CLASSY in mid stretch, inched away to the sixteenth marker
 then held off that one determinedly. JUST CLASSY stalked the winner to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, pushed up to loom a threat in
 mid stretch, got outrun to the sixteenth marker but was coming on again late. SEIZE THE CHANCE was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned five wide to the
 stretch and closed willingly but too late. MAUI MAGIC pressed the winner two then three wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and could not
 save the show. SNOW PACK chased the pace to the turn, raced four wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. COMMISSIONESS lagged to the
 turn, was seven wide to the stretch and never a factor.

 Footnotes
 DRIZZY was shuffled back leaving the five eighths and shifted widest, raced seven wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily to prevail.
 TITO'S SODA stalked the energetic pace to the turn, swung out from the three path to the five path mid turn, shifted out once in the stretch for room,
 crowded BOOZE CRUISE at the three sixteenths, closed willingly but could not stall the winner. POWER TIMES TWO hustled along to contest the pace,
 was four wide to the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then was outfinished late. NUTTY SIERRA also was used early to dispute the pace, raced three wide to
 the stretch, responded to mid stretch but was weakening late. PLANET NINE was a pace factor inside a four horse spread while off the rail to the stretch,
 remained a threat to mid stretch then tired. BOOZE CRUISE chased the leaders to the turn, was fanned out five then six wide to the stretch, had to check
 when TITO'S SODA shifted out in front of him at the three sixteenths and came up empty late. STARTING LINEUP had no speed, raced three wide on the
 turn but was not a threat in the drive. UNCONTAINABLE flashed good speed inside rivals to the turn but dropped back suddenly to the stretch and gave
 way.
