 SHACKLEFORDS LADY stalked outside the early leader in the four path then surged clear through the final yards. FACTORY OF FAITH wasn't far back,
 came out into the five path on the turn, vied outside the winner through the lane but couldn't keep up late and finished in a dead heat for the place. PISTOL
 ANDIE broke slowly, raced two wide into the stretch, gave her best along the rail into midstretch but lacked the needed closing response and finished even
 for the place. REGAL ANTICIPATION moved to a clear lead just before going a furlong, raced the three path and faltered. VANIDOSA stopped.
