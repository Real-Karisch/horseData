 Footnotes
 KING'S GHOST settled nicely stalking the pacesetter then edged up to challenge NO SWEAT at the quarter pole, heated battle pursued, wanted to savage
 opponent upper stretch although unable to, rivals leaned into each other refusing to back down, had to move out wider when NO SWEAT started drifting out
 in late drive, got head by in final stride. NO SWEAT set the uncontested pace under comfortable fractions, challenged by KING'S GHOST leaving the
 quarter pole, dug in gamely under left handed drive upper stretch, brushed with rival and fought back determinedly from inside, drifted out in late stages and
 denied in final stride. LUNA AZTECA was rated in close contention not far off the leader, moderated pace set on top then launched three wide bid in final
 turn, was no match for pulling away top pair but dug in with good effort to hold share. FAITH N HOPE was unhurried racing in the back near the inside, sent
 driving entering the stretch, moved out wider, dug in but edged out for show. SILVER DIVA stalked along the rail, came under a ride along inside in far turn,
 gaveway in the lane. Run up distance unavailable

 Footnotes
 ARCHVILLAIN raced in tracking position just off the leader, began to move up closer to OFF DUTY still in hand after entering the turn then came under a
 ride to reach equal terms for lead leaving the quarter pole, rival held narrow lead then drove by taking edge and held safe. OFF DUTY quickly cleared the
 lead, continued to lead the way still in hand when ARCHVILLIAN moved up to challenge late in the turn, put to drive racing inside of rival and held slim lead
 then lost edge but continued to fight back til end. KING MAURO was step slow and hustled up to gain closer contention, saved ground along inside tehn
 angled out and launched bid for top pair late in turn, continued solid five wide through the lane clearing the rest. MOONSHINE MARTINI dropped back
 shortly after the start, saved ground along inside then angled out upper stretch to no avail. OVER LIMIT raced widest through the backstretch, carried wider
 entering head of the lane then started to lug in and held straight under left handed urging. DREAMY MARTINI showed response in opening stages then
 dropped back to last and failed to regain along inside in the lane. SAL'S JET chased the pace then drifted wider entering lane, continued to drift out while
 retreating.

 advantage to clear command, continued to hold on frontend then wore down in deep stretch. VISIONS OF YOU raced off the top two leaders then hustled
 up three wide in the turn, kept under a ride along outside with response and produced solid effort. HASTA LA BYEBYE hustled up along inside through the
 turn, came out few paths upper stretch, showed interest but lacked needed response for impact. RUN RITE was sluggish at the start, raced in the back then

 THE MONEY TRAIN stalked near the inside and settled nicely in hand sitting off top pair near three eighths pole, angled out three wide and moved by
 clearing lead with ease near the quarter pole, came under right handed urging in the stretch, drew off to easy score drifting wider late. LUMINARY FLIGHT

 the pace then vied for lead two wide in the turn, was no match when winner took command near the quarter pole, lost place in late drive while besting the
 rest. HANGRY tossed head and slow at the start and continued in the back, sent driving along outside entering the lane then drifted wider and failed to
 move on. AL KHOR raced in range along the outside failed to make impact in the lane. BLUEGRASS ENVY sped to the lead, cleared and angled inside
 then quickly came under pressure from DANCE AROUND, vied along inside in the turn then failed to move on at the quarter pole, came up empty in the
 lane. STARSHIP DANNY showed early response then steadily retreated.
