 HOTTER THAN SINN set the pace while off the rail to the stretch, responded to the pressure in the drive and held stubbornly. CARNIVAL LIGHTS stalked
 the winner to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then finished steadily and gamely got the place. MIDNIGHT GAL was unhurried to the second
 turn, saved ground to the stretch, also was gaining late but missed second. STILL SPINNING prompted the winner three wide early, raced two wide while
 being outkicked on the second turn and weakened in the stretch. BELLE'S COMMAND had no speed, raced three wide throughout and did not rally.

 Footnotes
 ASTRA STAR was unhurried to the half, rallied two then three wide to the stretch, got to terms in upper stretch, dug in determinedly through a long drive and
 got a hard-fought nod. GRAY MADAM pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up three wide to take command, responded when hooked by the winner
 in mid stretch then battled gamely and just missed. STAUD'S SWISH had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then closed
 ground steadily to the line. THAT'S YOUR STORY saved ground throughout but lacked a closing response. TIME FOR A MEMORY set the pace to the
 second turn then tired and stopped in the drive.

 just missed. CLUDE pressed the pace for six furlongs, responded to mid stretch then stayed on to the line. WILLIAM CROTTY set the pace from the rail to
 the stretch, responded to pressure to mid stretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. TOUGH EMBLEM hopped at the start and lost three lengths, trailed to
 the second turn, came two wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. MAGIC MOON stalked the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to
 the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. FOOZER was outsprinted early, settled to the second turn then had nothing to offer in the

 Footnotes
 SKY FOREVER was chasing the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch then dug in determinedly in the final furlong and pushed clear to the line. NO
 MORE TWINKIES set the pace while off the rail to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch but was tiring, could not stall the winner but held the place. LOST
 IN LEXINGTON had no speed, shifted off the rail mid turn, raced two wide to the stretch then closed ground willingly in the drive. FOXY LOVER pressed the
 pace to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. OUR CLEMENTINE tracked the leader two wide to the
 stretch but could not muster the needed late response. WHISK was also chasing to the turn then got fanned out four wide to the stretch and was gaining in
 the late going. REGAL LADY had no speed and was never a factor.

 LITTLE JACK was on the pace from the outset, raced three wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch, was collared by the runnerup but battled gamely
 to the line and got the nod. MANDALA chased the leaders to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied to get to terms with the winner nearing the
 sixteenth pole, stuck a nostril in front leaving that stanchion but hung late lost the nod. MAN FROM LAGOS lagged to the turn, saved ground to the stretch
 then responded, shifted out and finished fast to the line. PEPPERED PRO chased the leaders to the turn, came three wide to the stretch, loomed boldly a
 furlong out but got outfinished late. TUPELO CUSH dueled from the rail to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. SIX VOTES stalked
 the pace two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. NORTH PACIFIC stopped in the stretch, was eased then was vanned off.
