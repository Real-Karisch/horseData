 reached a forward position entering the second turn, responded to duel with the winner but was outnodded. MR EQUILIZER unhurried early from the inside,
 inched closer entering the second turn, altered outside for the drive, responded and was up for the show. LORD REDDING dueled from the inside early,
 battled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn but could not keep pace in the drive. OATH OF OFFICE six wide into the first turn,

 time. JAZZ TALK unhurried early from the outside, advanced through the second turn, came six wide into the drive and closed with a rush for the place.

 eighth pole but could not last. NORTH LIGHT RIDGE outrun early, advanced outside through the second turn, responded and had a late rally. ORTHODOX
 RIVER went evenly. MR. GRACEFUL up close early from the inside, chased the pace up the backstretch but had nothing for the drive. ETHAN'S LANDING

 clear while kept to task. A SONG OF FAITH stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, made a bid but was no match
 while clearly second best. SPICY AFLEET allowed to settle early, advanced inside up the backstretch, responded and was along for the show. CLASSY
 AND RICH forced the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the second turn but had nothing left. DIAMONDS AND OIL pressed the early pace
 inside but could not keep pace. SUMMERS BACK chased the early pace but had no late response. DESTINY'S PORT was pinched back at the start and no
 factor. CARMEN'S PICTURE dueled from the outside and faded. GABBY'S GOT GRACE dueled from the inside early and gave way.
