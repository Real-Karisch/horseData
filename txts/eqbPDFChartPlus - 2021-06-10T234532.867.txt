 STRIKE BOLD had rivals on the outside early on, quickly shook them off and was much the best. LORD BALTIMORE was anxious in the gate then broke
 awkwardly while ducking in, chased the pace between horses and was all out through the finish. ROYAL GEORGE bobbled at the start then bumped with
 MY MAN THIRSTY leaving the gate, ran towards the rear, hugged the rail into the stretch and was able to gain positioning. WIN WISH chased the pace
 down on the inside then lacked the needed rally. WAR EXECUTIVE chased the pace on the outside going three wide around the turn then folded up. MY
 MAN THIRSTY was anxious in the gate them stumbled at the gate, got bumped when coming into stride but stayed in contention until getting pinched back
 at the half then retreated from there. TROY STORY bobbled at the start then was outrun.

 DESERT JEWEL was unhurried outside, angled to the rail midway on the turn, angled out sharply for room entering the final furlong and quickly drew out
 before five furlongs and was under mild urging. MISS TIAGO was slow to settle, stayed out from the inside and made a belated run past tired ones.
 BOHEMIAN BLISS took command at once, raced two wide between rivals and weakened in the drive. JADYN'S G G pressed inside the early leader and
 tired. ABRACADABRA stayed well out from the inside and weakened. SMARTY MADDY was outrun after a slow break. HERE'S THE CALL raced three
 wide with the pace for about a half then stopped.

 NOBLE PRINCE stumbled at the start, recovered quickly and sprinted to the front and was much the best. GOODNEWSWITHATWIST was allowed to
 settled then closed very well down the lane. FRAME chased the leader the whole way, vied for the lead at the quarter pole and was all out in the stretch but
 did not have enough. GRANDPA'S KING ran towards the rear then had a strong late rally. CHURCH MONKEY tracked the pace then lacked a rally.
 MAUZZIE was no factor. LULU HAD A BABY trailed. On March 1, 2017 via Pennsylvania State Horse Racing Commission ruling no 17077PN,
 GOODNEWSWITHATWIST was disqualified and placed last after testing positive for oxycodone.
