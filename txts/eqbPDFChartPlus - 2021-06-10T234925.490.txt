 and inched away late. RADIO SILENCE also pulled then pressed the pace outside a rival, stalked leaving the second turn, re-bid between foes in deep
 stretch and edged a rival for the place. FLY TO MARS had good early speed and set a pressured pace inside, inched away on the second turn, came a bit
 off the rail in the stretch, fought back in deep stretch and was edged for second. HOOTIE pulled under a hold and bumped with a rival then steadied into the
 first turn, stalked between foes, found the rail in the stretch and was outfinished. SOUTH AMERICAIN settled inside then steadied off heels into the first turn,
 chased outside a rival on the backstretch and second turn and lacked the needed rally. BUCKYS PICK was in a good position stalking the pace three deep,
 continued three wide on the second turn and into the stretch and did not rally. FARLEY pulled and bumped into the first turn then steadied in tight early on

 TOUGH BUT NICE sped to the early lead, set the pace well off the rail on the backstretch, angled in a bit off the fence on the turn and into the stretch and
 held on gamely under urging. MAKE IT A TRIPLE stalked outside then five wide into the turn, continued four wide on the bend and three deep into the
 stretch, drifted in some in the drive and surged late outside the winner. LINDANTE broke a bit in the air, chased three deep, angled in on the turn, came out
 in deep stretch and held third. BRADDOCK saved ground stalking the pace, steadied in tight into the turn, came out into the stretch and lacked the needed
 rally. MY MAN CHUCKLES stalked off the rail, went four wide into the turn, angled in between foes into the stretch and did not rally. BOLITAR stumbled at
 the start, stalked between horses then inside on the turn and weakened. GENTRIFIED was away a bit slowly and squeezed back, saved ground off the
 pace and was not a threat. ALL STAR PARADE bobbled and broke out onto a rival, was taken off the inside then chased outside a rival, came a bit wide
 into the stretch and lacked a further response.
