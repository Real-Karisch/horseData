 Footnotes
 SANDSTORM within striking distance after angling toward the inside, shifted out three wide late in the turn, roused for the drive, outside bid nearing the
 furlong marker, kicked well clear while kept to pressure. MONARCHOS PRAYER back off the pace and the inside, came three wide out of the turn, steered
 out widest for the drive, finished willingly to be edged clear for the place. GREEN LAKES away in good order, pressured the leader from the outside into the
 turn, continued to forced the issue through the turn, challenged between horses past the furlong marker, could not match the top two late, saved the show.
 CRESCENT LACE broke alertly, cleared early, continued to set the pace inside, headed late in the turn, gradually weakened through the stretch while
 remaining inside. D'WILD MUFFIN broke slowly, never menaced. WARRIORS SPEAK failed to menace. SHE'S A QUEEN broke to the inside, was finished
 early.

 Footnotes
 WE GIRLS RULE last to leave, trailed into the first turn, made an early move three wide through traffic to take command before a half, set a soft set of
 middle fractions, dueled into the lane, edged clear the final furlong while drifting out a bit. QUICK FIX also broke near the back, recovered to race forwardly
 and outside, four wide in the run up the backstretch, dueled with the winner into the lane, could not match strides the final furlong, held the place. DEEZ
 JITTERBUG set a slow opening quarter, continued in a forward position, evenly paced into the lane, slowly coming back for the place while not a threat to
 the winner. DAGAL void of speed, trailed, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position slightly. FRONTIER HERO within striking distance,
 had little left for the drive.

 Footnotes
 COPPER LADY forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, vied in the turn between foes, dueled into the stretch, steadily drew out in the run to the wire
 while kept to pressure. OPEN FOREST broke alertly, advanced and challenged between rivals and inside the winner turn, dueled with that one into the
 stretch, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. ELODY off a step slow, raced well back off the inside, staged a mild rally to be along for the
 show. OUTOFTHEBALLPARK also off a step slowly, raced back and inside, moved around a stricken foe midway on the turn, improved position slightly up
 the inside. MAMADANCESINTHESKY back off the leaders while toward the inside early turn, steadied slightly behind a stricken rival soon after, went evenly
 through the stretch in lacking a late response. LITTLE TATOR TOT moved up after the start to be clear before a quarter, showed the way into the turn,
 began to give way when headed three furlongs out. CUSTOM PAINT JOB pressed the issue four wide into the turn, appeared to take a bad step and bobble
 with just less than three furlongs remaining unseating her rider, apparent distress, vanned off.

 LE PIN (IRE) broke sharp, soon got clear, set a lively pace toward the inside, continued to lead by daylight into the straight, enough left to hold off the runner
 up late. KING CAKE unhurried for six furlongs, came in the four path and widest into the stretch, steadily getting to the winner late. FREEDOM FACTOR
 within striking distance throughout, lacked a winning response when called on in the drive. POPS LEGACY closest to the winner for a half, gradually
 weakened in the run to the wire. OPPORTUNITY COST settled off the pace, came up empty for the drive. HARDLY SEEN SLIM last away, trailed
 throughout in showing little.

 Footnotes
 JADED ROSE broke alertly, set the pace, was given a bit of a breather in the turn, extended advantage through the stretch under firm handling. JUNO'S
 STARLET bumped at the start, raced back while saving ground, rallied up the inside for the place, no threat to the winner. DR LIZ within striking distance,
 came on the outside for the drive, also proved no match for the winner, not enough for the place late. HALF A MILLION bumped with JUNO'S STARLET at
 the break, recovered to race closest to the winner, crept a bit closer in the turn then could not keep up in the drive, weakened late between foes to lose the
 place and show. SUZIE'S DREAM went one paced throughout in lacking a late kick. GRAND TUNER off a bit slow, never menaced.
 BELIEVEINSOMETHING was finished before a half.

 Footnotes
 GANGES forwardly placed while saving some ground in the first turn, continued to stalk through the second turn, outside bid on the leader nearing the
 furlong grounds, wore that foe down late under steady handling. HE'S A LADY TAMER took command soon after the start, set the pace, rated in the run up
 the backstretch, remained clear into the lane, briefly responded when the winner came alongside with less than a furlong remaining, could not match strides
 late, all out to save the place. A HE'S AN O'PRADO lacked early foot, saved ground through the final turn while continuing well back, angled out for the
 drive, set down and finished well to be getting to the runner up. CAPTAIN TYREE void of early foot while racing outside, four wide through the second bend,
 improved position while not a threat to the top three. ON CYCLE last to leave, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had
 been decided. ORTHODOX RIVER settled in mid pack for a half, tired in the drive. LAMU chased the runner up for five furlongs, stopped far turn, eased
 late, walked off.

 Footnotes
 ASPEN SKY cleared to the inside before a quarter, set the pace, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, maintained a daylight
 advantage through the stretch while being kept to task. ROCKIN RUSTY RUE lacked speed along the inside, asked along in the far turn, continued to save
 ground into the lane, moved out for the drive, closed some of the gap on the winner, clearly second best. SHEDROW COCKTAILS settled off the pace and
 the inside, moved closer in the second turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive and settled for the dead heat for the show. DADDY BILL last to leave,
 completely devoid of any early foot, steered out to be widest for the drive, late interest down the middle of the strip. WHISTLING RANGER back off the early
 pace, managed to improve position a bit into the lane, flattened out the final furlong. PIONEERING NATIVE void of speed, improved toward the inside into
 the stretch, also hung in the late going. FORUM FORM pressured the winner early from the outside, chased up the backstretch then gave way when the real
 running started. SANDANA HEAT four wide in the first turn when with the main pack, tired from those early efforts. CUSTOMIZED forwardly placed early,
 began a steady retreat before a half.

 DIVINE BEAN within striking distance early, fell back a bit in the turn to lose position, angled out a bit for room when straightened for home, outside bid,
 slight drift, duel, game. HAWAIIAN APPEAL also a forward factor early, moved to vie through the turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane, dueled inside
 the winner the final furlong, outkicked late. GENERAL TONE broke out and slowly, raced well back early, came five wide out of the turn when beginning to
 advance, rallied well out in the strip to be in time for the place. SMOOTH COLLIERY settled in mid pack early outside, closer in the turn while racing four
 wide, remained within striking distance past the furlong marker, lacked a late punch. MARDI GRAS MASK back off the pace, in some traffic late backstretch,
 came four wide out of the turn, improved slightly upper stretch, lacked a further response. ONEHOLYLION lacked speed, improved by saving ground into
 the lane, also flattened out in the final furlong. SIR ADVENT pressed the issue early off the inside, put a head in front in the turn, could not last in the drive.
 CALIMOR lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn, lacked a closing bid. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY was finished after a half. BENTONVILLE off a step
 slow, moved up early, faded before a half. TEE'S BLACK IRISH broke alertly, showed the way for three furlongs then stopped.

 Footnotes
 BIG EM C broke out, was straightened and close from the start off the inside, moved to engage the leader in the turn, showed the way into the lane, steadily
 clear. DEBDURITE broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, briefly offered resistance to the winner when that one came alongside in the turn,
 could not keep up in the drive, clearly second best. GATO AMERICANO void of speed for a half, four wide out of the turn, rallied for the show. LUCKY
 DOCTOR off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack early, went evenly through the lane and was not a serious threat. MR. SPANKY veered in start
 bothering and bumping inner rivals, was back early, improved slightly through some traffic down the lane. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
 REGARDING THE START, MR. SPANKY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED TENTH AND LAST. SMOOTH MAN soundly
 bumped by MR. SPANKY at the break, recovered to race forward early then began to fade after a half. RIDE void of speed, remained back, passed tiring
 rivals. BEAU'S LOGIC steadily faded. BAND OF DEMONS also staged a steady retreat. ST. PETE'S CROWN wiped out start, far back, distanced after
 losing contact with the field, walked off.
