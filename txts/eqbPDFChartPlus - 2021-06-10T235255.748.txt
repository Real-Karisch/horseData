 Footnotes
 BOSS MAN established the front and showed the way pulling on the bit a bit early on while under rating in the two path off the cones, jumped well to
 maintain his forward position, had the field bunch up in behind approaching fence five, came under challenge for the initial time nearing fence seven, jumped
 well and was headed nearing the final flight, took up brief residence in behind the new leader FIRST FRIDAY before tipping out into the final turn to engage
 that rival to the outside placed to urging, came again to take back command midway on that turn, edged away under a drive in the stretch through the flat
 getting geared down in the late stages to the finish. DARK GEMINI (IRE) settled in the two path off the cones at the tail of the field, jumped well to keep in
 range of the front patiently handled throughout, jumped well at the final flight and remained on hold until tipped out a path or two from in behind rivals set
 down at the quarter pole, kicked on belatedly through the stretch in the flat to secure the place honors. FIRST FRIDAY a bit washy, tracked two to three
 wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced under coaxing to issue a challenge at fence seven, took over command nearing the final flight and shook away
 briefly before being confronted by BOSS MAN midway on the last turn, got headed for command at that juncture, dug in under a drive through the flat and
 kept on clear of the rest for the show honors. WHITMAN'S POETRY between foes in the two path through the opening bend, jumped well until fence five
 when in tight off a rival landing poorly when put off heels of CANAVERAL as the field bunched up, came under coaxing at fence six and tipped three wide to
 avoid the rivals in front, completed the final two fences without incident but offered no response in the flat. GO GET THE BASIL a bit washy, jumped late at
 the first flight before settling along the inside, bobbled over fence four brushing a good portion of that fence, came under coaxing at the flight seven,
 advanced inside of CANAVERAL and bumped that rival offstride when landing after jumping the final fence, then weakened through the flat. CANAVERAL
 (GB) jumped early at the first fence before settling just off the pace, went three wide through the first turn before tucking to the two path, jumped well to
 maintain his position until the pace began to quicken through the final two fences, got bumped off stride by the aforementioned foe after clearing the final
 jump and tired through to the finish.

 Footnotes
 GIANT ENDING broke well and moved onto the inside route before arriving at the end of the homestretch, was eased into path three early on the
 backstretch, crept up towards the front runners, was the widest of three having a say for the front end during the run around the far turn, got put to a drive,
 as were at her fellow pace participants turning into the stretch, saw the middle member of that trio, that being HEAVEN'S CREATION drift into path three,
 followed suit by shifting slightly wider too, chiseled away at the deficit, struck the top with approximately a sixteenth remaining and shook free, kept to a
 drive. MY GIRL ANNIE broke sharply, cut over to the rail after clearing the others shortly after stepping onto the first turn, showed the way, rated and with
 HEAVEN'S CREATION in accompaniment out in path two, had the eventual winner add herself to the pace picture late on the backstretch, successfully
 fended off the other in-the-money finishers from the top of the second bend to its end, spun into the lane under a drive, was overhauled by GIANT ENDING
 in the general area of the sixteenth marker, had suffici9ent energy left to salvage second. HEAVEN'S CREATION made her way into path two soon after the
 field had been sent on its way, was held in reserve stalking the pacesetter, undertook the task from between rivals beginning from the half mile pole, got set
 down for the drive home, drifted into path three during its bid over the next furlong, failed to sustain it and backed away. BRIDGE OF SIGHS sent over to the
 rail after entering the first turn, vacated the premises as three-quarters pole was being completed, got driven three to four into the lane, made no impact.
 EIGHT MINUTE ELLIE coaxed in the pocket during the initial stages, was called upon at the midway point of turn two, gave way. SAY CIN CIN away a bit
 awkwardly, dove over to the rail, failed to pick it when asked at the three-eighths pole. YOU PROMISE pulling hard on the bit while fighting the pilot, tipped
 into path two a sixteenth into trip on the first turn, remained there chase up the chase, continuing to pull on the bit until the conclusion of the stretch, swung
 into the stretch and had no offering.

 Footnotes
 GHOST GIANT showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead before the quarter-pole,
 shook clear when set down into upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong, switched back to his inside lead late and proved much the best
 under steady urging. CAUSFORCELEBRATION was urged along off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, gained
 on the outside into the final furlong, switched back to his inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the place. BROCKMONINOFF bumped
 soundly with a rival at the start and was turned a bit sideways, was urged along towards the front, went two to three wide on the turn, came under a drive in
 upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and weakened then lost the place while clear for the show. WILD WILLIAM chased the pace from
 third, went around the turn in the four path, pursued the winner under a drive in upper stretch and tired. LA MANCHE broke out and bumped solidly with a
 rival, was urged along in the middle of the field, went around the turn in the three path, spun four wide into the stretch then came under the whip and lacked
 the needed response. UNSULLIED brushed the inside of the gate at the start, settled on the outside, moved in near the half-mile pole, went three then four
 wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ROUGH JUSTICE was hard ridden while chasing the pace, dropped back late on the
 backstretch, lugged out into the turn then checked sharply, rounded that bend in mostly the two path, dropped to the rail into the stretch and came up empty.
 FREUDIAN ANALYST was hustled from the start, dropped back while urged along, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, bumped with
 TAMMANY GIANT while out of contention at the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. BURKIE broke in and was off a step slow, was urged along at the rear on
 the outside, went around the turn in the four to five path, came seven wide into the stretch and also failed to threaten. TAMMANY GIANT kicked with his
 hind left leg just as the gate opened and was off a step slow while last away, raced near the back while ridden along, rounded the turn in the two path,
 swung five wide into the stretch, lugged in between the three-sixteenths pole and the eighth-pole, bumped with FREUDIAN ANALYST while out of
 contention at the sixteenth-pole and also was no factor. ENCHANTED FOREST was hustled from the start, set the pace under pressure, vied inside on the
 turn, lost the lead before the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and gave way. FERRAD'S PARTY broke awkwardly then was
 bumped soundly on both sides and bounced around a bit while squeezed back, immediately bolted to the outside fence, fell well behind and was pulled up
 then vanned off. (Rail at 18 Feet)

 Footnotes
 YOUR ONLY MAN lightly coaxed from the start, raced forwardly placed three wide through the opening bend before settling four then three wide just off the
 pace down the backstretch, began to advance through the far turn coming under a drive nearing the quarter pole, swung four then three wide straightened
 away for home, rallied to take over command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat through the final eighth and held gamely to repel a challenge to the
 finish. ACOUSTIC bumped at the start by TRICKED UP who came outwards under coaxing, raced four then three wide through the first turn before settling
 four wide in mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, swung five then four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild
 kick but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire. TRICKED UP broke out a step under coaxing and bumped the aforementioned foe, raced forwardly placed three
 wide through the first turn settling just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, paused behind a trio of foes at the
 quarter pole and swung just off the inside for home tipping out to the three path straightened away, got clearance and was roused three-sixteenths from
 home, then kept on to secure the show honors. WINGMAN coaxed from the gate, established the front crossing to show the way in hand along the inside
 through the opening bend, settled into a rhythm down the backstretch through sensible splits, remained on hold until the pressure in behind intensified and
 got put to a drive with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside for home before straightening away on the inside when under pressure, yielded
 command at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. IMMUNITY three wide into the first turn, raced three wide in mid pack, came under
 coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position through the drive. GLENNRICHMENT just off the inside in mid
 pack, came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch, came up empty. SOLUBLE (GER) three wide near the rear, came under
 coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, passed tired foes in the stretch. BE COUNTED coaxed from the gate, got taken in hand as
 WINGMAN crossed in front and grew a bit rank under restraint conceding the lead into the first turn, settled two to three wide in aim of that leader coming
 under urging at the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide for home, weakened in the final furlong. ODE TO THE HUNT just off the inside near the rear,
 came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, made no impact. CAMP COURAGE hesitated at the start conceding six to
 seven lengths to the front, raced four then three wide near the rear, came under coaxing three furlongs out, went six wide for home and made no impact.
 TERRIBLE DAY (ARG) coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun just off the inside for home and
 tired. PRETENTIOUS chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, dropped back through the far turn, went six to seven wide for home
 and was eased in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 CATORIA put to a lighthand ride during the opening panel, out-worked several others to establish control, showed the way from path two, tailed by OUR
 CIRCLE OF LOVE three wide, spun into the lane and was ridden out for most of the ensuing furlong, responded when instructed to give more with a tap in
 the area of the right shoulder at the furlong grounds, continued onward with good energy to stave off the second place fnisher. OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE
 pressed the winner three wide, had the rider resort to stronger handling as the half was being completed, finished well, but was unable to reel in the top one.
 SMILE MORE pursued the front runners in midpack from path two, got let out coming up to the head of the stretch, was fed a few shots from the left side
 being maneuvered into path four in midlane, rallied mildly the remainder of the trip to the wire to secure the show. TELL YOUR MAMA put a brisk ride after
 departing the backstretch, raced two to three wide on the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, failed to make an impact. ANAZARA sneaked
 its way into the pocket approaching the conclusion, tracked the front runners, without benefit of cover, cut the corner with clearance along the rail corridor,
 lacked the needed response and backed away. MISS VINEGAR made it over to the rail shortly after the start, went on to get angled five wide from
 five-sixteenths pole to the three-sixteenths marker, made no headway. CARNIVAL LASS three wide midway on the turn, was slightly wider at the top of the
 lane, failed to make her presence felt. IRISH PRINCESS guided over to the rail by the half mile pole, got worked into path five from upper to midlane to no
 avail. GIFTED LADY near the inside on the turn, failed to menace. SHE IS BEDAZZLING set to an abbreviated brisk hand ride after springing from the
 starting gate, travelled three to four wide on the turn, shifted closer to the rail after stepping into the stretch and gave way.

 Footnotes
 YOUR LOVE atatined a prominent position after the start, departed the backstretch from path three, sat perched within striking distance during the first half
 of the run around the bend, crept up thereafter enough so as to loom boldly by the quarter pole, was turned loose spinning into the lane, out-fought a pair of
 stubborn foes to the her inside during the ensuing furlong to take over by a narrow margin, dug in with good determination under good handling to stay in
 the clear. CAIRENN settled into midpack after the start, pursued the front runners, stationed in path two, going about at the task from between opponents,
 was set down a short distance from the end of the bend, swung four wide into the lane and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, flashed strong, but
 belated foot procuring the place. HEAVENLY SCORE bumped lightly with YORKIEPOO at the start, followed by some additional light contact almost
 immediately afterwards, responded to an abbreviated hand ride the rest of the way on the chute to cement herself into a forward position, vied for command
 to the outside of COME DANCING, got roused as the second fraction was being finalized, saw the eventual winner draw up menacingly during the final
 stages of the run around the bend, vied with vigour from the middle of rivals from that juncture to deep stretch, failed to claim the lead and had to settle for
 the show. COME DANCING under some light encouragement securing the lead, got switched over to a more relaxed hold afterwards, cut over to the inside
 route, showed the way, with HEAVENLY SCORE in attendance out in path two, came under heavier pressure when joined by the top one late on the bend,
 got set down spinning into the lane, relinquished before safely through the furlong grounds, remained prominently placed before weakening inside the
 sixteenth marker. IMPASSE took up the chase from path two, was asked to pick it up by the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out into the four path from upper to
 midlane, lacked the needed response. WONDERMENT loosely pocketed, faltered. YORKIEPOO PRINCESS pinched in the shadow of the gate after
 brushing with HEAVENLY SCORE, sat three wide firmly rated, angled five wide into the lane, had no rally. AURA ROSE lagged in the two path on the turn
 while trailing throughout.

 BANANA THIEF was reserved near the back of the field, went three wide early on the turn, angled five wide near the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the
 stretch then moved out a path more, rallied on the outside under a strong hand ride, was put to a right-handed whip while gaining inside the furlong marker,
 closed strongly to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. FRISKY MAGICIAN settled near the back of the field, went
 around the turn in the two to three path while still in reserve, dropped in at the top of the stretch then was roused, rallied along the rail into the final furlong,
 squeezed through inside of UNCLE YOUDGE outside the sixteenth-pole and closed well to just miss while able to get the place. WHATSTOTALKABOUT
 drifted in just after the start, tracked the leading duo on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, came
 under a drive in upper stretch, took the lead outside the furlong marker, led until near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the show.
 ETHAN HUNT was rated under a very strong hold, moved out near the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the three path, shifted five wide while roused
 at the quarter-pole, chased under a strong hand ride into the final furlong then came under a right-handed whip, hesitated between horses near the
 sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked but just earned the last spot in the superfecta. SAMADI SKY was reserved near the back, saved ground on the turn,
 came three wide while roused into the stretch, moved out while gaining under the whip into the final furlong, hesitated between horses near the
 sixteenth-pole and just missed the superfecta. SPEIGHTFUL KITTEN bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, started
 the turn in the two path, angled to the four path near the five-sixteenths, raced behind horses while under urging in the stretch, bobbled inside the
 sixteenth-pole and was also out-kicked. CALLANT was hustled from the start, settled under some urging, raced inside early on the turn, angled to the two
 then three path while roused later on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. UNCLE YOUDGE bumped with a rival at
 the start then was hustled, contested the pace on the inside of DOWSE'S BEACH, vied along the rail on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch,
 battled into the final furlong, dropped back near the sixteenth-pole and weakened. DOWSE'S BEACH bumped with a rival at the start, contested the pace on
 the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. TRIBECCA settled in a
 good position, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and came up empty. Following the
 race, the rider of SAMADI SKY claimed foul against WHATSTOTALKABOUT for alleged interference near the sixteenth-pole. After the stewards' inquiry, no
 change was made to the order of finish. (Rail at 18 Feet)

 DISCREET MISSION prompted the top pair three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, took over
 command straightened away and went clear under a drive to prevail. GO BIG OR GO HOME coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace between foes from the
 two path under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, proved no match for the top one while battling on through to the finish with
 ZENATO to secure the place honors. ZENATO hit the off side stall at the start getting away awkwardly and was hustled to the front, cut the pace under
 pressure from a pair to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and was displaced from command, proved
 no match for the top one, fought on inside the aforementioned foe to the finish but was bested for the place honors. ANALYZE YOUR LUCK broke out at the
 start bumping MONEY LAUNDERING, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and weakened. MONEY

 four wide for home and weakened in the stretch. SMASH WILLIAMS three wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing tipped out five wide at the
 seven-sixteenths floating LAKE PARTY six wide and STREET CAT SAM seven wide through the turn, swung six wide for home and made no impact.

 off the inside for home and proved no menace. LAKE PARTY bumped at the start by ZENATO, chased three wide down the backstretch, got floated six
 wide from the seven-sixteenths through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
