 Footnotes
 ACADEMY BAY stalked from between horses, went for the lead three wide on the bend, angled in some leaving the turn, was put to a drive in the lane,
 moved clear and held sway under steady handling. JACKIE BLU boxed in and looking for room behind the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn,
 threatened outside ACADEMY BAY upper stretch but could only just hold his position late. VACANZA forwardly placed from outside, steadily progressed
 four wide the last three furlongs, came up short but was clearly best of the rest. WARCRAFT contested the pace from between rivals, gained the rail on the
 bend then flattened out for the drive. MUCHO MACHO DAN advanced three wide on the bend but leveled off between rivals in the stretch.
 MISTERBULLTOYOU void of speed, angled out on the turn, came widest into the stretch and had no stretch bid. MIDNIGHT SHINE steadily faded from
 inside. DUJAC displayed early speed from between horses, began to tire leaving the turn and gradually angled out as he faded through the lane.

 Footnotes
 REGALISTIC was kept close from outside, advanced when allowed three wide on the turn, was roused entering the lane, quickly moved clear, was
 somewhat green under the whip then continued to widen command while ridden out. HAMAZINGLY RICH somewhat unbalanced at the break, started a
 chain reaction of bumping toward the outside, quickly recovered, chased from outside, lost ground four wide through the turn but got up for second late.
 YOO HOO'S ROCKET squeezed briefly at the start, progressed five wide through the bend, rallied outside HAMAZINGLY RICH in the lane and was
 narrowly outfinished for the place. VESTED CREEK prompted the pace between horses, went for the lead two wide on the turn, was no match for
 REGALISTIC when set down for the drive and slowly wore down inside the last furlong. OH SO TALL was hard sent to gain the early lead, challenged from
 outside on the turn and began to flatten out the last eighth. REVEREND DON well placed inside, lacked the needed late kick. BANDIT POINT gradually
 angled in on the backstretch, angled out through the bend and improved position without threatening. GOLD STRYKER ZACH advanced to contention after
 a slow start, was steadied behind traffic early in the turn and had no late bid between horses. FORT GIVEN was prominent two or three wide for a half mile
 then began to tire. MAGIC ERASER chased, stayed off the inside, stayed wide taking the bend and came up empty for the stretch run. C H JAY bumped
 with YOO HOO'S ROCKET at the start, lost ground taking the turn, angled in upper stretch and had little to offer. VELOCIDADE was hustled along to be an
 early factor but gave way after a quarter mile.

 Footnotes
 WICKED WEST gradually progressed from outside, was roused two wide on the turn, fanned out to path four entering the stretch, rallied under a steady
 drive and got up inside the last the last sixteenth. STAY SPICY chased from betweenrivals, angled three wide leaving the turn, swung out further for a clear
 path in the lane and rallied belatedly five wide. DRIP BREW broke in stride, moved clear after a quarter mile but gradually wore down deep stretch. AWAY
 TO TOWN without early speed, lost ground four to six wide through the turn, altered out further to stay clear of SIZZLE FACTOR upper stretch then closed
 well. INDIAN TRICK chased from midpack, saved ground on the turn and rallied belatedly two wide through the stretch. FOR ALL THE GRANDS was soon
 well back and only passed between tired ones late. ELIZABETH RULES prompted the pace while toward the outside, was just off the inside on the turn,
 fanned out further into the stretch and flattened. SIZZLE FACTOR hustled up to prompt the pace, drifted out through the bend and steadily yielded from the
 middle of the track in the lane. FLYIN' KATNIP hesitated then swiped the gate as she left it and showed little in a ground-saving trip.

 Footnotes
 BOLD PROPHET shared the early lead in hand between rivals, moved ahead and stayed just off the rail on the second turn, lost the advantage upper
 stretch, gradually drifted out in the late going but edged ahead in the waning yards. POWERFUL ALLY kept close just off the inside, squeezed through two
 wide between rivals midway on the second turn, floated out further into the lane, rallied to gain the lead upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed pressure
 with a furlong to go, was corrected, fought to the wire but had to settle for second best. FLIGHT RISK without early speed, came into contention just off the
 inside on the second turn, swung to the outside for the stretch run, took over third with a furlong left then could only pull clear for the show late.
 REMEMBERING RITA forwardly placed outside, lost considerable ground five wide through the second bend, angled in some in the lane and gradually
 yielded. SUPER DERECHO shared the lead outside BOLD PROPHET for nearly six furlongs then began to tire. SWITHERAL was reluctant to load and was
 never a factor. MONEYMEISTER displayed early speed from inside but began to tire after five furlongs.

 Footnotes
 READY AIM broke alertly, was rated off the early speed, circled rivals five wide through the bend, moved clear upper stretch and continued to open up
 under a mild drive. NEAPOLITAN shared the early lead from off the rail but inside rivals, was no match for READY AIM when set down for the drive but held
 second while all out. LORD TURNEM chased from inside, gradually angled out through the bend, came to the outside for the stretch run, closed well and
 got up for third nearing the wire. ARCHIVAL in the second flight between horses, came four wide in the lane and ran evenly. CHECKER CZECH vied for the
 lead between horses to the lane then lacked the extra needed. THE UNION FOREVER hesitated at the break and was hustled along early, angled out
 through the bend, progressed widest to midstretch then leveled off. THATABOYROY disputed the pace from outside, was four wide leaving the turn then
 flattened out for the stretch run. MOSTLY SUNNY well placed inside, came up empty for the stretch run. TIZATALKER chased from between rivals and had
 no late bid. THE GLORY MUSIC showed little in a wide trip. CASH FOR THE SOUL hesitated then bobbled at the start, recovered to race in contention on
 the backstretch but gave way between horses on the bend.
