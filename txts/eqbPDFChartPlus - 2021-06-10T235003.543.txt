 BAD AND BOUGIE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final
 turn, assumed command entering the stretch, and quickly drew clear while being ridden out in deep stretch. PENDER ISLAND away alertly and raced to the
 lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overtaken entering the stretch,
 and while no match for the winner, battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to prove second best. FOURTOWIN stalked the leader into the backstretch
 while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive. MIA BELIZE tracked the leader into the
 backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon, and finished
 from along the rail in the drive. SILVER AND STARCH unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced three wide into the final turn, but showed little.
 STORMIN JUDE away well and settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, saved ground throughout, but weakened over the final furlong.

 Footnotes
 SOUTHERN CASANOVA stalked the leaders from just off the rail entering the backstretch, pulled himself to the lead midway down the backstretch while
 racing two out from the rail, opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and widened his margin in the drive. GREAT BLAKE away alertly and tracked
 the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, advanced smartly four wide midway down the backstretch, chased the leader three wide
 through the final turn, and while no match for that rival late, battled gamely three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. LIQUID METAL settled off
 the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied smartly two out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to
 get up for a share. STONERIDGE RULER lagged well off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final
 turn, and closed four wide in the drive while improving his position. GOOD AS THEY GET lagged well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail
 entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. SEEKING ASYLUM away well and dueled for
 the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, was overtaken midway to the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, but was outfinished late.
 PAYTON'S BEST broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, was unable to keep up to the leaders in the run to the final
 turn, and was outfinished in the late stages.

 Footnotes
 SANTA FE TRAIL unhurried early while dropping back to trail, advanced from along the inside midway down the backstretch to gain a striking spot
 approaching the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and wore down PARSIMONIOUS to get up in deep stretch. PARSIMONIOUS away well and
 dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, took
 command entering the final turn, but was unable to hold off SANTA FE TRAIL late while proving easily second best. IAMA BETTER CAUSE away alertly
 and stalked the leader one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the
 drive to get up for a share. MOUSSAKA CHEF tracked the leaders two out from the rail through the stretch the first time, loomed a danger three wide
 approaching the final turn, rallied three wide into the final turn, but was unable to sustain his early move through the final furlong. SHERIFF CLARKE vied for
 the lead from along the rail through the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken entering the final turn,
 and outfinished over the final furlong. MY EYE CANDY settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, raced three wide into the final
 turn, but needed more when called upon. INSTANT CASH broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering
 the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late. EL DIAMANTE stalked the leaders into the stretch the
 first time while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

 Footnotes
 SPECULATOR broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail commenced his bid two wide entering the final
 turn, assumed command in mid stretch and drew clear late. CHEF unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and
 closed willingly two out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. SPOKANE'S GEM away well and raced to the lead one out
 from the rail through the stretch the first time, opened a clear advantage in the run down the backstretch, and into the final turn, was overtaken in mid stretch
 by SPECULATOR, and just failed to hold the place. LADY LARUE away alertly and tracked the leader from along the rail entering the stretch the first time,
 held a stalking trip from along the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
 when called upon. RANDOM ACT settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run
 down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid. SANTA CAUSE tracked the leader two wide through the
 stretch the first time, continued to chase the pacesetter in the run down the backstretch, but weakened over the final furlong.
