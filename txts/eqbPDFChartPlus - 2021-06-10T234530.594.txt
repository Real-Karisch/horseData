 Footnotes
 RARE MIX saved ground and was eased back just off the leaders heading to the backstretch, swung out rallying three wide midway around the far turn,
 reached the front straightening away and held off two challengers despite drifting out. BREAK AWAY raced in midpack two wide early, steadied attempting
 to split the leaders on the far turn, altered course outside and had the rider lose the whip turning for home, then closed determinedly under strong hand
 urging widest and could not get up. VOILA LA VICTOIRE (IRE) was three then two wide into the first turn, gained ground moving three wide early on the far
 turn, swung four wide nearing the lane, bid through the final furlong and steadied between the top two at the wire. CAPE MAGIC saved ground on both
 turns, came two wide into the lane and lacked a rally. CELTIC EMBRACE bumped with FISH AND CHIPS at the start and raced in closest attendance to
 that one through a pedestrian first quarter-mile, made her way to a brief lead two wide between horses late on the far turn, then faded through the stretch.
 FISH AND CHIPS got to a clear early lead after bumping with CELTIC EMBRACE at the start, showed the way inside and was finished soon after going six
 furlongs. DIPLOMATIC AFFAIR steadied two wide between horses heading into the first turn, trailed throughout and was not persevered with after losing
 contact with the field.

 Footnotes
 MIZZ TUTU brushed a bit at the start, then raced under a snug hold while wanting to more in opening stages, was nicely rated off the embattled leaders, sat
 comfortable under a confident pilot, gained along the rail at the quarter pole then angled out three wide, raced on near equal footing with EVA LONDON but
 had more in reserve and edged away, well ridden. EVA LONDON raced in hand while matching strides for the early lead, took on added challengers and
 continued unasked through the backstretch, took a narrow lead near the quarter pole then took on the challenge of MIZZ TUTU at the head of the lane,
 fought back heads apart from inside position but lacked a needed kick in reserve to move on. HARPER'S SMILE brushed with rival at the start then moved
 up to join the pace nearing the half mile marker, continued to duel four deep then failed to move on with the top two, remained in contention and continued a
 steady bid to capture show in deep stretch. ELIZABETH'S VOW was rated off the early pace, made a move along the rail leaving the turn, gained ground
 then set sights on the top two leaders, angled three wide, could not reach rivals, battled back for show and could not get by to gain position. BROKEN
 MEADOW vied along the outside of EVA LONDON for the lead in opening stages, took on added challengers and continued to hold position between, failed
 to keep up the pace midway through the turn and weakened through the lane. VANISHING LADY raced just off the top two then moved up to duel three
 wide, continued to fight back between then came up empty approaching the quarter pole and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. TAPICERA made a
 outside move at the half mile marker, could not continue bid shortly after, dropped back, eased by the wire and walked off after the race.

 Footnotes
 GRAN ABARRIO made his way over to the two-path after clearing the field out of the chute, set a controlled pace slightly off the rail and widened through
 the stretch under a drive. NEPHEW HOWARD D chased outside the winner from the outset, was put to an all-out drive on the turn, could not match strides
 and continued on to best the remainder. AMERICAN TZAR stumbled at the start, recovered to chase the pace between horses down the backstretch,
 dropped over to the rail on the turn and could not gain. IL NONNO veered out sharply at the start and was corrected, raced within striking range four wide
 into the turn and went by only tired horses. RANDY SR was slow out of the chute, moved up along the inside under urging down the backstretch, then could
 not keep pace with the leaders around the turn. LUCKISBACK chased three wide and began losing position before reaching the turn. TITO CONTROL
 saved ground and was outrun throughout. BISHI was never involved while two to three wide on the turn.

 Footnotes
 EPIC DRAMA tugged while a bit rank wanting to do more in early stages, continued keen but settled more, took the inside path entering the head of the
 lane, took over the lead from CRACKIN JON, shown the whip but never used and continued while ridden out. CHARLIE THE GREEK tracked up close in
 the backstretch, launched a bid for the top two at the head of the lane, could not reach eventual winner but continued a steady effort to gain place.
 CRACKIN JON was quick to the lead at the start, continued to lead the way, took on the challenge of EPIC DRAMA entering top stretch, could not move on
 with rival but kept along for the runner up spot then lost position in final stages. BOBBY BLUE EYES raced along in range running through the backstretch,
 made a move at the quarter pole, continued driving four wide, flattened in the final furlong then was vanned off after the race. VENCEDOR raced five wide
 near mid-pack in the backstretch, hustled up five wide into the lane, came out wider when put under left handed encouragement then lacked a needed kick
 for late impact. RED AT LAST was away last, saved ground along the inside, took closer order but was not enough to move into late contention. RED
 COTTON showed response racing between foes in compact flight, lost position and continued to fade into the lane. LEDBETTER raced up close in the
 opening quarter, began to weaken three furlongs out and finished far back. ARLEN'S PROSPECT came up empty after the half, dropped far back, eased by
 the wire and walked off after the race.

 Footnotes
 EKLIPSADO argued the early pace inside MASS APPROVAL as the riders of both warily eyed the loose horse to their outside, allowed MASS APPROVAL
 to go clear and was taken outside to stalk that one, was put to a drive late on the far turn and fought his way to the lead, lost the advantage in deep stretch
 but battled back and put his head back in front at the wire. HORNER MAN was outrun early, put in a sustained run along the rail approaching the stretch,
 got through a large opening inside MASS APPROVAL to grab the lead in deep stretch, then drifted out in the last strides and was outgamed. MADROOS
 moved closer to the leaders late on the backstretch, challenged three wide under urging around the turn, remained a factor to upper stretch and flattened
 out. GRAN IDENTIDAD made up some ground three wide coming off the turn and continued evenly through the late stages. MASS APPROVAL cleared off
 from EKLIPSADO for a while down the backstretch but came under pressure through the turn while slightly off the rail, remained prominent to deep stretch
 and weakened. SKY GUY made up some ground through the middle fractions two wide and lacked a late rally. BUSTER ROCKS saved ground within
 striking range for six furlongs and faded. ROYAL ROGUE stumbled badly at the start and unseated his rider, galloped around the course without incident
 and was apprehended past the finish line. AFTER A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE START THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

 Footnotes
 CHARLOTE'S STAR led the way in the first turn and continued to set the pace throughout the backstretch, took on the challenge of SISTINE SISTA at the
 head of the lane, asked for more, continued with willingly response and held firm. SISTINE SISTA raced along the rail and steadied a bit in the first turn,
 continued stalking just off the inside, angled out a path top stretch, headed in pursuit of CHARLOTE'S STAR, raced within striking distance but lacked
 needed kick to get by. BLENHEIM PALACE raced three deep off the pacesetter in early stages, dug in for the top two leaders in upper stretch, lost ground
 on the top pair then dug back in to hold show. ABOVE THE MARK was allowed to settle in early stages, picked up the pace to move closer into range,
 roused three wide top stretch then angled inside, was no match for the top two leaders but continued to dig in, narrowly missing show. WAR BABY was off
 step slow at the start then continued unhurried in the back, swung into action along the outside leaving the far turn, roused four wide in the lane and
 improved psoition. ANGELS SEVEN (IRE) raced up close between rivals in the backstretch, lost position near the quarter pole then steadied, kept on under
 a ride but had nothing in reserve for late stages. BELIEVE IN ANGELS steadied along the rail in opening stages continuing into the early backstretch,
 quickly shifted out and sat in stalking position, came up empty in the far turn and dropped far back in the lane. MO LIGHT settled off the early pace, began
 to pick up the pace along the rail three furlongs out, lacked racing room running behind ANGELS SEVEN, had to be completely taken up, lost all momentum
 and dropped far back.

 Footnotes
 HOLLYWOOD TOMCAT saved ground early, went two to three wide rallying late on the turn, caught SPUNZIG just inside the eighth pole and drove clear
 under good handling. BRADLEY'S SUNSHINE was close-up along the rail through the early going, was shuffled back steadily late on the backstretch and
 around the far turn, got through a small seam two wide into the stretch and finished gamely inside. TIZTHESOUND checked for several strides when put in
 tight quarters between horses two wide on the first turn, rallied through a crowd three wide turning for home, was bothered and altered course inside the
 furlong grounds and was up for third in the final strides. S S ILLUMINATI was a forward factor toward the inside to the stretch, drifted out impeding
 TIZTHESOUND while tiring and lost third to that one at the line. SPUNZIG was headstrong and checked through the first turn in tight quarters, pulled his
 way to the lead well out in the course down the backstretch, remained in front to midstretch and gave way. PEGASUS KITTEN was outrun two wide to the
 far turn, swung out to be five or six wide into the lane and passed rivals late while no threat. LA BOOT ON pressed the pace three wide on the first turn and
 between horses down the backstretch, went two wide around the far turn and faded. ACE OF HEARTS came off the rail around the first turn tightening
 things up on TIZTHESOUND and SPUNZIG, wound up four wide on the far turn and had no response. DIETITIAN MICHELLE was strung out five to six
 wide into the backstretch, remained very wide still within range around the far turn and weakened in the stretch. CATNAPPED was four wide around the first

 Footnotes
 BATTALION RUNNER got brushed between at the start then raced just off BEASLEY, quickly moved up to apply outside pressure to rival, dueled for the
 lead into the lane, took slight edge over aforementioned rival then found more in reserve and moved away. BEASLEY led the way in opening stages then
 quickly came under a challenge from BATTALION RUNNER, dueled along the inside into the lane, battled back along the rail under left handed urging then
 lacked a needed kick to move on late, finished clearly second best. PAINTER'S RAGS was rank and ran up off the heels of BATTALION RUNNER in the
 first turn, continued a bit keen then settled into outside stalking position, came under a ride leaving the far turn, continued a steady effort but was no late
 match for top pair while securing show. LOOKIN AT BLESSING broke out and brushed with rival at the start, remained reserved racing near the back, saved
 ground then shifted out four wide in upper stretch and had mild position improve. SILENT DECREE raced a bit tight along the rail in the early backstretch
 then settled into stalking position, continued in close contention off the top pair, asked for more approaching the quarter pole, lacked needed response to
 move on then steadily faded in the lane. FIRE FOR EFFECT was away last and angled in to save ground in the first turn, continued reserved in the back,
 raced along the outside entering the lane and failed to move on. ARRECIFE broke in and brushed with rival at the start, raced in range running through the
 backstretch then came up empty and dropped far back in the lane.

 Footnotes
 DANCER'S EDGE was three wide off the first turn moving closer to the leaders, remained three wide around the far turn, chased the pacesetter for the
 length of the stretch and got up in the last strides. BLIND RUCKUS was quickly in front to set the pace off the rail, remained clear to deep stretch despite
 drifting out and just failed to last. CARBON DATA was two wide early toward the rear, began to edge closer three wide around the far turn, continued to gain
 on the far outside through deep stretch but could not quite reach the top two. HAWK was two to three wide around the first turn chasing BLIND RUCKUS,
 continued outside that one to the top of the stretch before moving to the rail, and finished evenly. AQUA TEEN raced in midpack two wide on the turns and
 finished with some interest between horses. KABANG saved ground early, was two wide on the far turn and posed no threat. MORE ALEX dwelt and broke
 outward to spot the field about five lengths, raced three wide and gained some ground late without factoring. SONGEUR saved ground throughout and was
 never a factor. SALUTATION was well placed within striking range for a half-mile and faded.

 CHIA GHOST sat back off the quick pace, roused five wide entering the lane, set sights on the lead, dug in gamely from the outside and finished
 determinedly to prevail. GRAN THE MAN raced up close under steady encouragement, cut the corner and roused along the rail, edged by SWAGGER in
 the deep stretch then got outkicked by CHIA GHOST nearing the wire. SWAGGER took the lead after the initial sixteenth, continued quick on top, remained
 the leader in the final furlong then got worn down in deep stretch. MORE MIA raced in pursuit off the leader, continued up close three wide within striking
 distance then yielded in final stages. BANZAI CHARGE was away last at the start and continued in the back, hustled up four wide entering the lane, moved
 closer inside despite left handed urging and improved position. CREAKY CRICKET hustled up through the backstretch, raced in range at the quarter pole
 then failed to sustain needed kick and flattened in the lane. RED CREME raced up close along the outside, could not keep up the quick pace and
 weakened. WHERE'S THE BAY hustled up along the inside after the start, showed initial response then lost ground, continued inside urging into the lane
 but failed to move into late contention.

 Footnotes
 LITTLE SKY was hustled away from the gate to a clear lead, slowed the pace down through the second quarter-mile, maintained a clear advantage on the
 rail into the stretch and held firm despite neglecting to change leads. REDISCOVER tugged his way forward while four wide into the backstretch, went three
 wide into the far turn chasing the leader, had every chance through the stretch but could not get by and was not gaining late. KITTEN'S DILEMMA bumped
 with SAMBROOK EDGE at the start and raced three wide early among a trio chasing the leader, steadied slightly from between horses approaching the far
 turn, was put to a drive soon after and continued evenly unable to gain outside the top two. VINO BLANCO raced on the rail throughout and rallied mildly
 without seriously threatening. FULLBACK FOYE raced within striking range two wide to the stretch and had no final rally. SAMBROOK EDGE bumped with
 KITTEN'S DILEMMA at the start, was far back and two wide early, fanned out five wide into the lane and passed tired horses on the far outside. COLD AZ
 ICE saved ground much of the way, came off the rail two wide midway on the far turn and lacked a response. LOOKIN UP was three wide turning into the
 backstretch, remained well out in the course coming off the far turn and failed to reach contention. ROLL ON TIDE was two wide on the turns, cut the corner
 into the stretch and tired. DAWN PATROL moved closer three wide into the backstretch, remained in range to the far turn while continuing wide and gave
 way.
