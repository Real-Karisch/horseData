 Footnotes
 A. A. AZULA'S ARCH got out to set a clear early pace, was completely unpressured, saved ground throughout, was clear turning into the stretch and drew
 off. MO BIG CAT trailed the field, was unhurried down the backstretch, began to rally along the inside at the 5/16ths pole but was no match for the winner.
 MIDNIGHT FLASH broke inwards, raced in midpack on the inside, commenced a rail bid at the 3/8ths pole, was asked for more late on the turn and evened
 out in the stretch. REAL POINT broke inwards, raced in midpack while two-wide on the opening turn, was three-wide entering the backstretch where she
 advanced to stalk the leader, raced three-wide on the far turn and had no response when she was asked for more. L. A. HOUSE was taken back, raced
 two-wide while near the back on the opening turn, ranged from two to four-wide on the far turn and was never threatened. WILD LUTE tracked the
 pacesetter while racing two-wide, dropped back at the 5/16ths pole and was empty in the stretch. This race was hand timed.

 MARTEN LAKE stalked the pace, raced along the rail and tw-wide on the turn, was blocked in the stretch, a path opened along the rail in the late stages
 and he just got up under a drive. VIRGA raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive and just missed. THREE RING
 CIRCUS set a pressured pace, was joined late turn, shook clear upper stretch but failed to hold in the final yards. FOREST BROTHER broke outward and
 settled off the pace, was hustled angling from two to four-wide on the turn then finished gamely outside. CAT ZAPPER raced in mid pack, was checked in
 tight along the rail at the turn, saved ground to the stretch, was blocked mid stretch then tendered a good late run. OLIVIA'S UNCLE forced the pace, bid
 late turn, dueled, yielded grudgingly upper stretch and tired after a brief chase. CLEVER NOW was pinched back just out of the gate, settled in mid pack,
 came three and four-wide through the turn then evened out in mid stretch. This race was hand timed.

 Footnotes
 THE OTHER BREEZE got away well then settled well off the pace, began to close along the rail mid turn, angled out sharply late turn, was six-wide when
 he straightened away for the drive, made the lead quickly and drew clear under a hand ride. COLEYVILLE raced in mid pack, came in a path early turn,
 continued along the second path to the stretch, split foes upper stretch and lodged his bid but was out kicked. DETROIT STEEL (IRE), in range, closed
 four-wide late turn, led upper stretch, was joined quickly but failed to match strides. UNBOUNDED SPIRIT stalked the pace along the rail, was in tight upper
 stretch then chased in vain once clear. ALACRITOUS raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then evened out mid stretch.
 ATLANTIC CROSSING settled off the pace, was squeezed early turn and checked hard, chased angling from the rail to five-wide, came seven-wide into the
 stretch but failed to menace. GUNNER BEN broke alertly, was joined in a duel, battled two and three-wide on the turn, was passed upper stretch and
 flattened out. SILENT BLAZE settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide late turn but lacked a closing response. STORMY ACTION dueled briefly and was
 taken back to stalk the pacesetter, rebid nearing the turn, vied to the stretch and tired. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUN THROUGH THE TURN
 CONCERNING COLEYVILLE AND ATLANTIC CROSSING LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED. This race was hand-timed.

 Footnotes
 ASK THE BOSS showed brief speed then stalked the pace, closed four-wide and bid late turn, had command at the top of the stretch then widened under a
 drive. STILL IN FASHION moved up the rail to press the pace, bid into the turn, dueled, was passed at the top of the stretch but chased to the end. ADIOS
 MIA raced in mid pack, chased three-wide late turn and finished under a determined drive. WHILEYOUSLEEPING settled off the pace, chased angling from
 the rail to three-wide on the turn then closed with some interest. PIC PRINCESS ZIZI broke outward and settled well off the pace, angled from the rail to
 three-wide on the turn then rallied mildly through the stretch. SHAUNESSY raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but never
 reached contention. DUCHESS OF LYNN, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace.
 RECONSIDERED had a brief early lead, was joined at the turn, dueled, was passed at the top of the stretch and tired. DIAMOND VISION, in range, chased
 hard along the rail on the turn but had no response in the stretch. LOVE AND LAUGHTER also had brief speed, remained in range to the turn and faded,
 then was eased in the stretch, finished the course and walked off.
