 Footnotes
 MY COTTON CANDY stalked the leaders, bid three wide on the turn, rallied outside of ABUTEL in the stretch, battled it out with that rival through the lane
 and edged away late for the win. ABUTEL stalked close up two wide, bid two wide on the turn, took over, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and
 yielded grudgingly. ENGLISH TOFFE ROSE raced off the pace outside a rival, came two wide into the lane, failed to threaten and was well clear for the
 show spot. OBSESSION set the pace, briefly dueled inside on the turn, then faded. MI TIA REGIS raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
