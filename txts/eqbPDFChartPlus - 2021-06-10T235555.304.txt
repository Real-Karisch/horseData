 CONTINENTAL DIVIDE bobbled at the start, angled in and settled inside, swung three deep into the stretch, bid four wide under energetic handling in
 midstretch, drifted in and gained the lead in deep stretch and gamely prevailed under a late left handed crack of the whip. FOSTER BOI chased outside a
 rival, came out leaving the second turn and five wide into the stretch, bid three deep between horses to put a head in front in midstretch, also drifted in and
 continued willingly inside the winner. RINSE AND REPEAT saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch, was in a bit tight off heels in upper
 stretch, came out again and gained the show. UNBRIDLED ETHOS stalked just off the rail then outside a rival, bid three deep leaving the second turn, was
 carried out a bit into the stretch, continued between foes in midstretch and was outfinished. FAST AS CASS pulled along the inside and was in tight into the
 first turn, saved ground stalking the pace, waited some leaving the second turn, continued inside and steadied in tight in midstretch, came out and could not
 summon the needed late kick. MINOSO had speed outside a rival then inched away and angled in on the first turn, dueled inside, came a bit off t he rail into
 the stretch, fought back and drifted inward in midstretch and weakened late. PREACHING TRAINER pulled three deep on the first turn, tugged his way up to
 bid outside a rival and dueled on the backstretch and second turn, was between foes leaving that turn and into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

 GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) veered out sharply at the start to drop back, angled in and saved ground, went between foes leaving the backstretch and on the
 second turn, bid three deep into the stretch to gain the lead, inched away under a left handed crack of the whip while drifting inward in midstretch, then
 kicked clear and lugged in badly despite another left handed crack of the stick in the final sixteenth. SWAMP SOUFFLE bumped at the start, stalked outside
 a rival then bid alongside the pacesetter on the backstretch and second turn, took a brief lead between foes into the stretch, could not match the winner but
 was clearly second best. TIKKUN OLAM broke out and bumped a rival, pulled along the inside and steadied early, saved ground stalking the pace, came
 out into the stretch and gained the show. SYNTHESIS broke a bit slowly, came just off the rail and pulled early, went outside a rival on the backstretch and
 three deep into and on the second turn, fell back and angled in leaving that turn and weakened. CONTAGION squeezed a bit when bumped at the start,
 took the early lead and angled in, set the pace inside then dueled on the backstretch and second turn and into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

 FRIDAY'S AT SHADY tugged his way along four wide between foes into the first turn, angled in and dueled inside, inched away on the backstretch, fought
 back along the rail leaving the second turn and under some left handed urging through the stretch and gamely prevailed. SPECTATOR'S DREAM had
 speed between foes then stalked a bit off the rail or inside, bid outside the winner leaving the second turn and through the stretch and continued willingly but
 could not get by. PALACE SAGE also had speed three deep between foes then stalked outside a rival, continued off the rail on the second turn and
 between horses into the stretch and held third. JONATHANTOQUICK allowed to settle inside then off the rail leaving the backstretch, went three deep into
 and out of the second turn and lacked the needed rally. DERBY STORM had speed inside then stalked just off the rail on the backstretch, split rivals into the
 second turn, angled back to the fence and weakened in the drive. BLUE SKYE JADE reluctant to load, pulled his way along five wide into the first turn then
 angled in and dueled outside the winner, dropped back between foes into the second turn, angled in on that bend, came out into the stretch, gave way and
 was eased through the drive.

 Footnotes
 OCEAN FURY pulled along the inside then stalked from the rail, came a bit off the fence leaving the backstretch, angled three deep into the stretch, bid
 three wide under urging past midstretch, took the lead late and gamely prevailed. AUSSIE FOX hesitated to be away behind the field, settled inside then off
 the rail on the backstretch, angled back to the fence nearing the second turn, cut the corner into the stretch, came out and bid between foes past midstretch
 and continued gamely to the end. BORU took the early lead and set a pressured pace inside, inched away on the first turn, responded when challenged into
 the second turn, edged away again on that bend, came a bit off the rail into the stretch and fought back inside the top pair to the wire. ARMED WALL
 pressed the pace outside a rival then stalked a bit off the fence, re-bid alongside the pacesetter into the second turn then tracked just off the fence on that
 turn and into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. TASTEMAKER chased outside a rival then between foes on the backstretch, went up three deep
 on the second turn and into the stretch and did not rally. INDOCTRINATION (IRE) saved ground chasing the pace throughout and could not offer the
 necessary response. SILENT MUSKETIER three deep on the first turn, chased outside a rival to the stretch and weakened. REFRACTOMETER broke
 outward and slowly, dropped back inside, came out into the stretch and failed to menace.

 MADMAN stalked then pressed the pace three deep, tracked the leaders off the rail into and on the turn, re-bid three wide into the stretch to gain the lead
 and drew clear under some urging and a hold late. ON EASY STREET unhurried off the rail on the backstretch, angled to the inside into the turn,, cut the
 corner into the stretch, split rivals in midstretch and again late to gain the place. ARCARO broke a bit slowly, pulled his way along outside then chased off
 the rail, came four wide into the stretch and edged a rival for the show. SLY bobbled at the start, moved up inside then bid between horses, dueled
 alongside a rival into lane on the turn, put a head in front between foes into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive and was edged for a minor
 award late. PASSING sped to the early lead, set the pace inside then dueled along the rail, fought back leaving the turn and weakened in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 GOLDEN BIRTHDAY chased inside then a bit off the rail, went outside a rival on the second turn and three deep into the stretch and rallied under urging to
 be along in time. JAMMING EDDY angled in and stalked off the rail then bid outside the pacesetter on the second turn to duel for the lead, came out into the
 stretch then came in and bumped that one while taking a short lead in the stretch, dueled for the lead, was bumped by that rival in deep stretch and could
 not hold off the winner. HIT THE SEAM broke out onto a rival, sped to the early lead, set the pace inside, dueled along the rail on the second turn, came out
 into the stretch, was bumped and forced inward in midstretch then drifted out and bumped the runner-up late. FLICFLAC angled in and saved ground
 chasing the pace, continued along the rail in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. JETOVATOR broke slowly, pulled between foes and came in early
 then came out and bumped a rival in the run to the first turn, stalked three deep then outside a rival to the stretch and lacked the necessary late kick. GOOD
 BYE PUTIN off a bit slowly and squeezed some, chased outside a rival then three deep into and on the second turn and four wide into the stretch and could
 not summon the needed response in the drive. DESMOND DOSS angled in and settled outside a rival chasing the pace, came three wide into the stretch
 and lacked the needed rally. UNUSUALLY HANDSOME was bumped and forced out nearing the first turn, angled in and chased outside a rival then a bit off
 the rail, continued inside on the second turn, came out into the stretch and did not rally. GOOCH EXPRESS angled in and saved ground chasing the pace,
 cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a further response. AIR JOCKEY crowded at the start, settled inside then between foes leaving the backstretch,
 came out into the stretch and not a threat. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the early running between JETOVATOR and UNUSUALLY HANDSOME
 but made no change when they ruled the trouble to the latter did not alter the original order of finish. Another inquiry into the stretch run between the second
 and third finishers resulted in no change when the stewards ruled both runners contributed to the contact between them
