 Footnotes
 PUBLIC POLICY broke sharply, showed the way to the lane and held well to the wire. PATRON (GER) pressed along the inside into the turn, stayed inside
 and finished willingly. MY MAJESTY moved up into the turn and chased then needed more. LATE CALLER saved ground, moved just off the inside for the
 drive and lacked the needed late response. LODE THE GOLD up close early, raced in the five path into the lane and lacked the needed stretch bid.
 DUPLICATE COPY stayed outside, was five wide entering the stretch and had no rally. GEORGE'S MAIN MAN had no rally. RED STORM RISING failed to
 menace.

 Footnotes
 PRINCE OF PARIS was never far off the pace, rallied into the turn, awaited room, bid between horses, assumed command near the eighth pole, inched
 away and held well. GINS AND GIGGLES was unhurried early, saved ground, angled out on the turn, bid eight wide, found his best stride late and got up for
 place. THE GREAT CAPER raced close to the pace inside, fell back on the turn, came again and earned show. DEL RIO HARBOR pressed the pace,
 challenged for the lead on the turn, swung five wide, fell back and leveled off. AIKMAN JACK was sent to the front to set the pace to mid stretch, weakened
 and lost position. CABLE JETT showed good early speed while racing inside, fell back, offered a mild bid only and improved position. ALPINE GATHERING
 raced close to the pace, rallied on the second turn to loom a threat, was carried six wide and faltered. WILLING TO TRAVEL lagged while racing outside,
 rallied into the second turn to loom a threat, swung seven wide and gave way. SOCRATICAL raced outside in an even effort and did not threaten.
