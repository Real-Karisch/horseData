 Footnotes
 TICKLE BUNNY was forced three wide and settled in the second flight as the outer most of three abreast along the backstretch before widening margin and
 finishing in hand well clear of all rivals. SOON TO B saved ground while stalking through the opening half before splitting foes at top of stretch and kicking
 away from the rest of field while proving to be no match for runaway winner. CONFUSED gave chase to frontrunning trio from between horses, angled out to
 five wide in the second bend but was no match for top pair in final furlong. TESUQUE was unhurried early and trailed the field through the first two calls
 before responding well to urging near the three eighths pole and closing the gap on front runners to improve placing. SUITS ME lost ground to frontrunners
 through the opening turn by travelling widest of all rivals and passed tiring foes in homestretch. BEWITCHY rushed to share early command from between
 rivals through the opening half and was unable to sustain the bid in closing stages while fading rapidly. JUSTABOUTRIGHT flashed early speed as the inner
 most rival of three abreast, was on the lead in concert with WILD PROSPECT along the backstretch but was used up and retreat in the homestretch. WILD
 PROSPECT was well rated through the opening half from a three wide pose before tiring in the final turn and failing to produce a closing bid.

 WELDER rushed from outset to establish a ground saving stance, assumed command after a quarter mile and strided away from field just missing the track
 record. TIZ ALLUPTOME NOW flashed immediate speed as the outer most rival of three abreast along the backstretch, maintained that path through the
 bend and was well rated at top of lane but proved no match for tough winner in final furlong. D' RAPPER gave chase to frontrunning trio down the
 backstretch, swung to four wide through the bend, was not far out of it at upper stretch but lacked a rally in closing strides. FAST BREAKIN CASH came
 away alertly and gained early command from between WELDER and TIZ ALLUPTOME NOW through the opening half but failed to sustain that bid in the
 homestretch. KING OF THE COURT trailed from outset and was no factor as the widest of all rivals.

 Footnotes
 LADY APPLE broke in tandem with all rivals and travelled four wide through the opening half, exchanging command with other frontrunners then entered the
 homestretch in concert with GOLD STANDARD and proved best in the lengthy stretch duel. GOLD STANDARD was very well rated between rivals through
 the first bend, led between calls along the backstretch, was two wide at top of lane before being outdueled in final furlong. CLASSIC FIT hustled from outset
 to preserve a ground saving stance, had the slightest of leads through the opening bend and exchanged command along the backstretch but was unable to
 match strides with the top pair in homestretch. SHE'S SHINEY rated close up and trekked three wide through the opening quarter despite stumbling at the
 break, gained command near the halfway point, and faded in crucial stages.
