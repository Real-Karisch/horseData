 Footnotes
 MAJESTIC HEIST raced in midpack, closed three-wide late turn, launched an all out stretch drive and got up late under steady pressure. BAKERSFIELD
 was nearest to the leader on the backstretch, closed gradually on the turn, took command upper stretch but failed to hold the winner safe in the late stages.
 NEIL'S DIAMOND raced off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished all out. CLEVER NOW, away slowly, settled off the pace,
 was steadied behind rivals midturn, angled three-wide, lugged in through the stretch but showed late energy. D'S DOUBLE EAGLE raced off the pace, was
 hustled two-wide on the turn then finished gamely to no avail. MIGHTY GENE sprinted clear quickly, set the pace, was tiring upper stretch and was passed,
 faded under urging, fell 70 yards out and eventually walked off. LOWI VENE settled in midpack along the rail, was hustled on the turn, fell over the fallen
 horse in the late stages and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE SPILL CONCERNING MIGHTY GENE AND LOWI VENE IN THE STRETCH
 LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

 TREETOP SINGER broke outward and bumped XICA, set a pressured pace, dueled from mid turn with SINFUL PLEASURES, turned that one back
 approaching the top of the stretch, was engaged by GIOVANNA PONTI, dueled through the stretch and prevailed under a drive. TYPICALLY, in range,
 stalked the leader on the turn, launched her rally along the rail at the top of the stretch, finished fast but just missed. GIOVANNA PONTI forced the issue,
 bid four-wide late turn, dueled gamely but was outfinished. XICA, bumped at the start, raced in midpack, chased three-wide into the stretch and was gaining
 late from the outside. CONQUEST BAD GIRL stalked the pace in hand, closed three to five-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. SINFUL
 PLEASURES bore out at the outset, forced the pace, tendered a brief bid midturn then chased through the stretch. ASK THE BOSS was bothered by
 SINFUL PLEASURES at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled on the turn but never reached contention.

 chased into the stretch and finished gamely. SWEET ESCAPE settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then closed a gap through the stretch.

 DAN THE TIN MAN raced in midpack, closed four-wide late turn, rallied outside and got by late under a drive. AZIMUT pressed the pace, took command
 early turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch then failed to contain the winner late. KITTEN CANDY raced in midpack, was hustled two and three-wide on
 the turn then finished under a determined drive. SPEEDY FOX settled in midpack, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and
 finished gamely. PHIL IN THE BLANK was sent to the early lead, was joined by SPLENDID GLORY at the turn, bested that one quickly but was headed by
 AZIMUT, chased to the late stages and evened out. DIXIE WHISTLER, bumped with SPLENDID GLORY at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled
 three-wide on the turn then finished with good energy between foes. GO GREELEY settled in midpack, was steadied in traffic at the turn, chased two to
 four-wide then finished gamely in vain. SPLENDID GLORY bumped with DIXIE WHISTLER at the start, moved quickly up the rail to bid into the turn, dueled
 briefly and backed away.
