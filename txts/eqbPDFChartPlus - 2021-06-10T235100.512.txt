 GRASS RUNNER sped clear and angled over to the inside, padded lead around the turn, never challenged in the lane and won easy. BUCKY GOLDSTEIN
 settled off the pace, saved ground along the rail, rallied and bested the rest. FAST LANE LARRY chased from the inside, two wide on the turn, never
 produced a bid and was edged for the place. SUNDAY PULPIT showed no early speed, traveled two wide and improved position. JALISCO THREE chased
 outside a rival, three wide into the lane and weakened through the final furlong. LOVE YOUR LIFE raced off the rail, lugged out on the turn and proved no
 menace.

 GIO'S GOLD broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, set a pressured pace between rivals, held the advantage inside of T'S PLACE through the turn,
 dug in through the lane and held off foe in the final sixteenth. T'S PLACE pressed three deep early, challenged from the outside around the turn and through
 the lane but couldn't get by the winner. SUMMER BUDDHA unhurried in the beginning, raced two wide through the turn, never found the needed late kick
 but was along for the show. TROJAN THE WILDCAT showed speed along the inside, chased the top pair to the lane and weakened. HEDOESITINSTYLE
 traveled along the inside to the lane and proved no menace. MORE SUN bumped at the start, raced off the rail, four wide into the stretch and failed to
 threaten.

 Footnotes
 CHANGING KARMA dueled outside a rival, two wide on the turn, cleared that one but received another challenge from ADROSA SKY, dug in late and held
 well under right-handed urging. ADROSA SKY chased from the inside, angled three wide, closed but lacked the needed late punch. TAKE CITY BY STORM
 stumbled leaving, dueled from the inside into and around the turn, failed to match strides into the lane and weakened. GUTSY STREAK angled in early on
 the backstretch, stalked the top pair, angled four wide on the turn, asked and never responded. WHERE'S BUBBA showed no early speed, angled out on
 the turn and proved no menace. MR. ZIPPERS took the tun three wide and was never a factor. Due to a timer malfunction there was no quarter fraction for
 race four.
