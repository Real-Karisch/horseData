 into the lane and was up for the place late. REAL WINDY stalked the early leaders racing three or four wide to bid straightening out of the second turn,
 continued to late in the far turn and could not sustain the run. JAMES THE MARVEL stalked the pace in good position while saving ground but lacked a final
 closing run. BOSS HOGG WHO prompted the early pace from outside the winner and weakened into the lane. SIGNIFICAT was not a threat racing wide.

 Footnotes
 YOUNG HOMIE made the running inside DRAMA COACH and slowly edged clear in the lane under steady handling. RETROFIT was three to four wide just
 off the leaders and narrowly gained the place late. DRAMA COACH forced the issue from outside the winner through the turn and could not save position
 late. DOUG was just off the leaders out from the rail to midway of the turn, moved inside and had aim turning for home but could not produce the needed
 late rally. BREAK FREE was outrun. TYLER BIGO stumbled badly a jump out of the gate and unseated his rider then chased the field through the course
 with no mishaps while riderless.

 FALLING ASHES was not long in moving clear and establishing position inside, took command heading up the backstretch and widened while kept to task
 through the lane. ACTIVE MERRY steadied slightly entering the first turn, settled three wide and was able to gain the place late. TEA AT NOON chased the
 winner throughout and weakened to lose the place late. CHALK LINE lacked a rally racing three wide. SHESAFIREBALL hesitated at the break to get away
 last and was never a factor racing four and five wide. SHESAHAWK was always well back racing four wide. SPARKLES chased the pace from four wide
 and tired.

 C O LITTLEJOE hesitated at the break but quickly recovered to stalk the leaders from four wide, bid through the far turn to show in front turning for home
 and edged away under steady handling. REIGN ON prompted the pace from outside WATCH OUT to the far turn, dropped back while floating six wide into
 the lane and rallied clear for the place but could not go with the winner. WATCH OUT made the pace from along the inside and had nothing left in the drive.
 PRINCE OF SHAW hesitated at the break then came out suddenly into the first turn and moved up three wide through the far turn while not a threat.
 BOCKSCAR ENOLAGAY tracked the leaders in good position three or four wide to the far turn and weakened. IMABUSHWACKER was packed out as a
 rival got out into the first turn then failed to threaten while three or four wide. KIOWA COUNTY followed the early pace two or three wide and tired early.
 WHISKEY CHICK was always back.

 Footnotes
 SPELL WINDER showed speed inside ALBERDAWN but settled and angled outside that one leaving the first turn, forced the issue from outside that one to
 bid and edge clear into the lane then kept safe late from a shrinking margin. COWBOY'S MARY L settled back off the pace while angled four wide in the first
 turn, rallied through the far turn and slowly closed on the winner late. ALBERDAWN gained a short lead outside the winner early, continued from inside that
 one heading up the backstretch and came up empty nearing the lane. NORTHERN ROCK tracked the leaders from three wide for nearly a half and
 weakened. LADYBUG'S HOLIDAY saved ground and failed to mount a bid. MIRACULOUS CRYSTAL followed the pace from four wide and tired.

 Footnotes
 MY LADY J was inside a four-way duel on the lead, edged clear into the lane and slowly widened under steady handling. HOLIDAY CLOVER was on the
 outside of a four horse duel on the lead in the turn then could not go with the winner in the lane. Q. T. KAT dueled from between rivals through the turn and
 weakened into the lane. ONE AFLEET STAR was behind the dueling leaders while three or four wide and had no rally. HEROWINSTHESPOILS improved
 position along the inside while not a threat. AUTOMATIC LADY was not a factor and floated seven wide into the lane. AIRIETTE was between horses in the
 four-way duel and took up from tight quarters, checked off stride and dropped back.

 OSAGE WARRIOR was on the pace inside NO WAY OUT throughout, kicked well clear into the lane then kept that one safe late under steady handling. NO
 WAY OUT prompted the pace from outside the winner throughout, dropped back nearing the lane then rallied back late but could not run down the winner.
 GIANT RESULTS settled back off the pace while saving ground early, angled out four wide heading up the backstretch to rally through the far turn then
 gained the show but could not threaten the top pair. NEW TESTAMENT stalked the leaders from two or three wide to the far turn, moved inside while
 nearest the top pair and weakened into the lane. LOOSEHORSE LARRY tracked the pace set by the top pair from four wide and tired.
 HOTTERTHANAPISTOL was always back. ALEX saved ground and tired.
