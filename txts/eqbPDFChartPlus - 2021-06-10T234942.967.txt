 Footnotes
 ARABELLA BELLA was closest pursuer off the clear leader through backstretch then closed the gap in the turn, cleared on top at furlong marker then held
 gamely under pressure. FROZEN HANNAH was allowed to settle in early stages then picked up pace late backstretch, took closer order still unleashed in
 final turn, came under strong handling entering top stretch, roused forward into striking distance but could not get by. SHE'S RIGHT AGAIN rated through
 the backstretch, gained position in far turn then under strong ride turning for home, kept under steady urging, advanced into close contention then yielded
 late. TRILBY was unhurried through the backstretch, set down five wide for the drive, moved into close range then finished evenly. NIKKI'S CAUSE was
 reserved racing in or near the back, produced wide bid with response in the lane but needed more for late impact. MI CUAIMA sped to the lead in opening
 stages then widen to clear advantage on top, continued to lead the way into stretch then collared by eventual winner and had nothing left in late reserve.
 RUN BLONDIE RUN rated off the clear pacesetter, saved ground then quickly retreated mid-way through far turn.

 I'M CARDINAL applied pace pressure to TEN BANDS in opening stages, moved up inside at three eighths pole and dueled for lead at quarter pole, took
 slim lead upper stretch, kept under strong handling and shook free late. TEN BANDS set a pressured pace then got out a path near three eighths pole and
 dueled outside of I'M CARDINAL, rival took slim lead upper stretch, kept on gamely with ears pinned back but could not match rival late. SWAGGER raced
 in range tracking early pace, under a ride along inside at quarter pole then came out wider in stretch and closed on place. QUICK CONNECT forwardly
 placed chasing the pace then gaveway in stretch. GNARLY hustled up then came out wider near three eighths pole, driving five wide in stretch but lacked
 needed kick for impact. HONOLULU EXPRESS raced off the early pace, driving into stretch but failed to kick on. HARRY'S GONE GRAY raced in the back
 and failed to gain threatening position. STREET GIANT hustled up along inside then steadied mid-way through the turn and failed to move on.
