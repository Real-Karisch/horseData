 finished gamely to prevail. THE CODE IS GRAY moved to the front along the inside on the turn and drew clear, raced off the rail turning for home, moved
 back inward and responded willingly in the drive but was overtaken nearing the wire. WASSUP BRO vied early then chased, drifted out turning for home,
 continued to chase and finished willingly. RAISE THE GAMBLE broke in bumping a rival, raced near the rail into the stretch and was gaining well late.
 DELUX PREMIER saved ground and lacked the needed rally. JUNE AND JOHNNY raced wide into the lane and lacked a stretch bid. SHAKLSTER vied
