 Footnotes
 ALY'S OUTLAW under a strong hold early, saved inside, settled in striking distance through the backstretch, was put to a drive at the head of the stretch
 and was along in time. BLACKSTAR quickly went to the front to show the way, responded to challenge from KODIAK KING and was caught late. KODIAK
 KING stalked the pace from the three path, lodged a mild bid at the quarter pole and was outkicked. GOT TWENTY broke slow, trailed the field, shifted wide
 into the backstretch and lacked a late kick. AL'S HARLEY failed to threaten. MAXIMUS PRIME hustled away and tired early. ** STEWARDS INQUIRY- The
 stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving GOT TWENTY, after review it was deemed that GOT TWENTY did receive a fair start and
 made no change.

 and failed to threaten. MAIDEN VOYAGE lacked a serious bid. SASSY CANDY hurried away, drifted out in the turn carrying out BEST IN SPIRIT out and

 ABERDEEN TIME lacked early speed and showed some mild interest late. NOTHING PERSONAL failed to threaten. HIGH IMPACT stalked the
 pacesetters, responded to handling approaching the stretch and rallied late to narrowly earn second. SHEEP RIVER BEAR reserved off the pacesetters,
 advanced inside quickly, shifted out at the top of the stretch and won driving. CHEEKY PURCHASE set a pressed pace, disposed of outside rival, jumped
 tire tracks midstretch and was bested late. SILENT COMMAND pressed from outside, was unable to match strides with CHEEKY PURCHASE and tired.
 TEEMANS DREAM slow to stride, raced four-wide in the first turn and tired early. SILVER CHARGER forwardly placed, dropped back and passed tiring
 rival.

 PRIVATE MONEY GAME vied inside, contended the pace through the backside, repelled challenge from LANGARA won driving. COOLIDGE reserved off
 the pacesetters, waited for running room into the far turn on the rail and closed late. HEMLOCK CHANNEL unhurried early, launched an all out bid racing
 three to four-wide in the final turn, moved up menacingly but was not good enough. ROYAL WARRIOR trailed early, rallied four to five-wide at the top of the
 stretch and closed under mild urging. LANGARA contested the early pace from between rivals entering the backstretch and weakened late. SIR BRONX
 fanned three-wide in the first turn, settled off the pace and lacked a response when asked. KILLIN ME SMALLS fanned five-wide, stalked the pace from the
 three path and stopped. BLUE DANCER forwardly placed in the four path, was done early and eased.
