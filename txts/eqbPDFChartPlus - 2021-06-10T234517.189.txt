 lane, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and rallied on the rail. LARRYANDPEARLSLUCY set the pace on the inside, steadied at the five and a half furlong
 marker, then vied between rivals and faded. LOOK IT LINDA tracked early on the inside, moved up on the rail to contest the pace on the backside, dueled
