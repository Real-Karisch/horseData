 TIMELESS TREASURE , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, gained the lead between horses inside the sixteenth pole, drifted out late and
 drove clear. ONE TWO THREE GO circled the turn three wide, reached a striking position in mid stretch then hung. FRIESING WATERS sprinted to the
 early lead, set the pace along the rail and weakened the final sixteenth of a mile. GO AMANDA lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn,
 angled to the four path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. SECUENCIA saved ground on the turn and retreated through the stretch. TREASURE
 TIME , shuffled back leaving the backstretch, was two wide on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor.

 NO REFUNDS , fractious pre race, came away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders while outside a foe, shifted out past the five sixteenths, cruised up
 five wide to take over in upper stretch, moved clear under three or four right handed taps and moved away while steadily hand ridden the final sixteenth.
 BAYTOWN LINDY rushed up between rivals to take the early lead, dueled two wide and to the inside of a rival around the turn, ceded command near the
 three sixteenths but continued willingly to be clear of the rest. JAGGER BABY , forwardly placed in the two path and to the inside of the winner, had her rider
 briefly lose the left iron nearing the four and a half furlong marker, shifted out under urging in upper stretch but lacked a bid. ROSSBY stumbled at the break,
 saved ground off the pace, moved up a bit past mid stretch then flattened out late. HI HI HOLLY failed to menace. HOLIDAY BID vied three to four wide
 outside BAYTOWN LINDY and gave way in mid stretch. ELYSIUM , outrun early, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide but failed to kick on
 through the drive.

 Footnotes
 INGADORE cleared early, dictated the pace under a light hold and towards the inside, moved away leaving the three eighths pole, entered the lane off the
 rail under a drive, wandered outward from left handed rousing in mid stretch and clearly proved best. JUNCTION stalked inside, edged closer nearing the far
 turn, angled out under pressure and chased the winner into the lane, faded in the final sixty yards but managed to hold on to the place. EARNED IT drafted
 in early and settled off the pace while in the clear, advanced to the inside of a rival leaving the five sixteenths and continued with some interest to gain. RIDE
 THIS TRAIN lagged off the pace, moved up between runners in mid stretch and kept on with some late action. RED AT LAST saved ground without
 threatening. HOWYAFORMONEY was lightly steadied at the break, moved up around the first turn then was taken four wide, chased to the far turn and
 faded. THROW THE DEUCE was acting up as the gates sprung, broke last then was used wide to reach contention, chased three wide into the far turn, was
 under a drive past the three eighths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way. MR. STIPA chased the early pace two wide and faltered.

 Footnotes
 TRAPPER'S DELIGHT bumped with FREEDOM STORM soon after the start, stalked the duel, eased out three wide leaving the turn, took command
 approaching the eighth pole and drew out under urging. CAPTAIN TRIPS , three wide leaving the turn, rallied. TAPITONTHESIDE , fractious going into the
 starting gate, disputed the pace two wide and gave way the final furlong. QUICKHATCH saved ground on the turn, eased out for the drive and failed to rally.
 EIGHTY BUCKS , checked in close quarters near the half mile pole, may have bounced off the inner rail entering the turn, remained inside horses and failed
 to rally. GREAT NATION , very wide turning for home, was not a factor. HERMANS GOLD lacked speed, was near the inner rail in mid stretch then altered
 course from behind a rival near the sixteenth pole. FREEDOM STORM showed speed along the rail, disputed the pace to the stretch then gave way.

 BABY BOSS broke sharply and established command, set a rated pace in the two path, handled some outside pressure, spurted away after being shaken
 up in upper stretch then steadily widened while under a moderate hand ride. ASSAIL , away alertly, prompted the pace three wide outside the winner,
 moved at that one nearing the quarter pole, failed to match strides leaving the three sixteenths but kept trying to the line and saved the place. PHANTOM
 SHOT , between runners near the half mile marker, angled in and moved up in upper stretch, chased past the furlong grounds and flattened out late. SILLY
 SISTER had a five wide trip but kept on with some interest. ROBIN'S DESTINY dropped off the early pace, was under a ride two to three wide in upper
 stretch but failed to muster up a decent kick. ELEVATED VISION stalked the pace four wide outside rivals, failed to kick on under pressure past the quarter
 pole and gave way. MARGIE'S MONEY broke a step slow, saved ground advancing to the far turn, pursued to upper stretch and faded.

 DESTINY OVER FATE had speed inside rivals then steadied along when rank past the seven eighths, relaxed and stalked leaving the three quarter pole,
 steadied again near the half mile marker, held a forward position saving ground past the three eighths, eased out for room heading towards the quarter pole,
 closed in under repeated right handed encouragement, forged ahead of GOLDEN GALA leaving the sixteenth pole and held firm. GOLDEN GALA advanced
 outside rivals to take command around the first turn, set a slow pace two wide, handled outside pressure leaving the five eighths pole, shook clear when
 coaxed along past the five sixteenths, shifted in close to the rail in upper stretch, dug in when confronted and kept on gamely to the line. PAT'S NO FOOL
 had an equipment adjustment pre race, broke a bit slowly, angled out to be three to four wide, moved up between runners into the far turn, swung five wide
 approaching the stretch and churned on. MARVELOUS MARTINA , taken to rate while not far back, edged up between rivals around the final turn, loomed
 into the lane but failed to seriously kick on. RIGHTEOUS RUBY , four to five wide, shifted in around the final turn and failed to menace. WEEKEND FLYER
 forced the issue three wide outside the leader, failed to match strides leaving the three eighths, checked when in close after six furlongs, faded and failed to
 recover.

 Footnotes
 DAT DARES GOLD , under urging three deep mid way on the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, gained outside the leader in the drive and was up
 late. MY CHESA CHARM sprinted to the early lead, drifted wide turning for home and weakened. BIG MOMMA , well back when rank at the break, raced
 two wide on the turn, remained in the two path in the stretch and rallied late. SPLENDOR GAL circled the turn four wide, angled to the six path near the
 eighth pole and passed tired foes. GIVEN ACHANCE , angled in leaving the backstretch, raced along the inner rail and failed to rally. POLARIZATION
 chased the pace and faltered. MS. PICADILLY stopped and was eased the final furlong.
