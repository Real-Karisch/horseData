 a Jockey's Objection and review by the Stewards' there was no change. WATCH MY STEAM stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering
 the turn, responded but could not reach the winner. GENTLEMEN'S GIRL dueled from the inside early, was steadied entering the turn, remained forward for
 the drive but could only hold the show. KARSLYN chased the early pace from the inside, made a bid entering the drive and finished well but too late. TAX

 WARRIOR was no threat. INDIAN BAYOU was never close. PEACH BABY dueled from the outside and gave way.

 clear. SPARKLING RED JET dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn but was no match for the
 winner while clearly second best. RACY unhurried early from the outside, advanced through the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive and
 closed with a rush for the show. MRS. MCGILLICUDDY forced the early pace inside, remained forward but had nothing left. SAWYERS GRAY GIRL dueled
 from the outside and tired. EXCITABLE GIRL flashed early speed and faded. PALMETTOVOWMENOT chased the early pace inside and gave way.
