 SOUTHWESTERN HOPE stalked, bid between foes taking the lead past the five-sixteenths, kicked clear in the final furlong. TARGARYCAT forced four
 wide on the turn coming five deep out of that bend, gained the place. TATANKA TRACKS switched off the inside while bringing up the rear, went in the four
 path on the turn, came into the stretch six wide and gained late. QUANTICO JOE chased in the two to three path through the turn into the stretch and had
 no late kick. ALMOST A STORM bid outside foes three to four wide on the turn but could not sustain the effort. THE GREAT DOME was urged clear, gave
 way.

 UNFOLDED MAGIC was just a bit fractious in the gate, quickly went to the front to dictate terms, drew away with mild hand urging in upper stretch and was
 ridden out. WESTLEY pursued the winner three to four wide, was no match but held the place. FREE MUSIC chased the winner mostly two to three wide
 and needed more. FIRST PLACE went four to five wide on the turn mid-pack and finished up mildly. WILLY TELL HIM saved ground but lacked the needed
 late kick. EMBELLISHING BOB stumbled at the start. MOOSEWOOD failed to threaten.

 settled early, advanced on the winner on the far turn, proved no match and just saved the place from. DYNABEAVER , who raced wide throughout, was
 gaining late but missed second. AFRICAN FIGHTER raced evenly and made no bid. CLASSIC GENT was unhurried early, improved position. JUNKERS
 tracked the winner along the rail, faded. A CEE DOO CEE dropped back, faded. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

 Footnotes
 BAD RABBIT settled last but one, advanced inside foes on the far turn, came out four wide leaving that bend but then shifted in for room, struck the lead
 seventy yards out and edged by. TRUST THE VAN stalked four wide early, advanced three wide into the far turn taking a narrow lead three furlongs out,
 edged clear into upper stretch, was reeled in late. AZTEC EMPEROR eased back and shifted in about three wide into the first turn, tracked mid-pack well off
 the inside up the backstretch, encouraged four then five wide on the far turn, was best of the rest. SPECIAL EXCESS saved ground settling into stride well
 back in the early going, switched out up the backstretch, came four wide past the quarter pole, improved. JEDI WARRIOR vied first outside then between
 runners, weakened. GERDA'S GONE was forwardly-positioned between rivals into the first turn then dropped back to track those from off the inside, ran
 evenly. DISCLOSED trailed early, passed some foes inside in the stretch but was never near enough to threaten. RAMBLIN TOUCH chased the leaders,
 weakened after five furlongs. CITY LIGHTS WHO vied inside, gave way in the stretch and faded. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION POSTED OPENING
 QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS INCORRECT.

 Footnotes
 STORMIN FAST forced the pace inside, drew off under a drive. JEWEL OF NAVARONE shifted in to save ground through the turn, steadied in tight near
 the quarter pole, secured and held the place. ESTEEMED was a bit reluctant to load, settled wide in the back half, swung seven deep, rallied. BINGHAM'S
 FLASH vied outside the winner, weakened. DRINKIN FIRE WATER settled in the clear behind the top trio early, went four wide on the turn, drifted out a bit
 in the stretch while lacking the needed late kick. MAIL MAN M G caught outside foes four to five wide through the turn mid-division, came into the stretch six
 deep, altered inside the aforementioned drifting foe. THE LAST FEAT was bumped at the break, raced well back early, swung seven wide and ran on mildly.
 SKIP BO broke outwardly just a bit, came out for the drive and improved. MR CHARLIE KING bumped the outside rival at the start, was in range off the
 inside early but came up empty. SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER chased going three to four wide between runners on the turn and was empty for the drive. LA
 RAE'S DANCE failed to threaten. DIABOLICAL TURN tracked the leading pair three wide early, dropped back and faded.
