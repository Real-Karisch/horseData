 SWEETHEART settled towards the rear, hit stride turning for home, closed willingly proving second best. POINTS DIALED IN tracked running towards the
 inside, mildly bid from mid stretch securing third place in last jumps. GO CATRINA GO broke alertly, dueled with the winner to the quarter pole, tired mid
 stretch and was edged out of third place. ALYSSA ROCKS stalked around the turn racing four wide, began to weaken inside the eighth pole proving no late
 threat. CLEARLY DREAMIN was soon outrun, never involved. HAZEL MEADOW flashed brief foot, gave way entering the stretch, was pulled up and rider
 dismounted and vanned off.

 Footnotes
 DUDE COWBOY raced up close along the rail, was hemmed in at the eighth pole and steadied briefly altering course, once clear quickly accelerated and
 drew off under hand urging. AVA'S PARKER broke well taking control, proved no match for DUDE COWBOY inside the eighth pole but was easily second
 best. COWBOY HARVEST pressed down the backside, began to chase from upper stretch, was no late threat but gamely saved third place. NORM lagged
 behind down the backstretch, gained momentum top of the lane, bid late narrowly missing third place. RASCALS RUNNING pressed the leader to the
 quarter pole, was all done and gave way in mid stretch, spent. SOFT MIX faded mid turn racing wide, offered little.

 Footnotes
 STARLIGHT ANGEL rushed to the top, led traveling in the two path, was kept to task late holding sway. SWEET PLEBE settled early, roused coming with a
 four wide bid at the quarter pole, could not make up ground on the winner while holding second place in a good try. SPACE ANGEL lacked early foot racing
 towards the rear, rallied coming five wide top of the lane, finished willingly picking up third place. LAUGHINATSTARS raced up close from the start, gave
 chase running inside, lacked late kick and tired late missing a minor award. CAN'TTALKRIGHTNOW stalked to the quarter pole running three wide, began
 to tire in mid stretch, no late factor. EXPLOSIVE KITTEN broke well runnign up close to mid turn, began to tire leaving the quarter pole, used up. QUEEN'S
 HAVEN settled towards the rear traveling mid track, roused to no avail, showed little. SEVEN DAY JAYE was soon outrun, trailed throughout showing little.
