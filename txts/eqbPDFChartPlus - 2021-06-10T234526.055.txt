 Footnotes
 TITANIUM opened clear to dictate terms, was well handled and safely led throughout. C ISLANDSURPRISE settled saving ground, got through every step,
 was making up ground on the winner but was all out to earn the place. PRINCESS DROSSIE settled along the inside at the tail of the field, took closer order
 with a half mile to run, shifted out and split horses entering the stretch, churned on well but settled for the minor award. IT'S THE TRUTH pulled three wide,
 was nearest the pace under a tug, came four wide but lacked a response when called upon. MAKE IT MARIA was allowed to settle and failed to make
 headway. TURN TO REALITY was through after a half.

 Footnotes
 AUNTIE'S THE ONE attended the pace along the inside, was put in tight near the seven-sixteenths pole, was bottled up in traffic through the second turn,
 shifted out and split rivals entering the stretch and wore down MARLINSPIKE in the final strides. MARLINSPIKE tracked three wide, forged command
 leaving the second turn, shook clear and kept on well but was unable to resist the winner. MOONLIT GARDEN stumbled at the start, pulled to contention
 between horses, was jostled between horses nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, fought on and loomed large leaving the second turn, but flattened during
 the drive and settled for the minor award. LITTLE CODE was unhurried, finished with a belated improvement, but failed to threaten. GULL ISLAND set the
 pressured pace along the inside, was headed leaving the second turn and gave way readily. SPICE DROP pressed the pace between horses, was bumped
 with seven-sixteenths to run, came up empty shortly after and retreated. KAI NALU contended five wide, came in bumping MOONLIT GARDEN nearing the
 seven-sixteenths, came up empty thereafter and dropped out. PER STEWARDS RULING AUNTIE'S THE ONE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND
 DEEMED UNPLACED.

 Footnotes
 CIARAN was unhurried off of the inside, took closer order five wide through the turn, angled out seven wide entering the stretch, engulfed the leader inside
 the furlong marker and quickly drew clear. JUST BE FRANK set the pressured pace three wide, opened clear and angled in on the turn, widened into the
 stretch, was unable to go on with the winner and was all out to just hold the place. PETE MARWICK settled saving ground, worked his way to the outside on
 the turn, came five wide and continued on well to earn the show. GREAT SKY broke slow and was bumped at the start, settled toward the inside, got
 through and ranged into striking distance, but flattened during the drive and faded. GREELEY CAN WIN stalked the pace, came four wide to make his bid,
 but weakened during the drive. PAPA CALIENTE contended off of the inside through the turn and tired. CAUSE TO ACTION settled off of the inside and
 failed to respond. BOOTS vied for the lead along the inside for a half and faded. MEILLEUR bumped with GREAT SKY at the start, was unhurried, drifted
 out on the turn and was never a factor. BLACK STETSON broke slow, rushed up five wide, but stopped after a half.

 ground, waited in traffic leaving the second turn, got through and finished willingly to earn the place. MAHVELOUS KITTEN stalked the pace four wide,
 moved with winner through the second turn, but weakened slightly during the drive and settled for the show. SAVOUR THE MOMENT was forwardly placed
 along the inside, shifted out leaving the second turn, but flattened between runners. KABELLA was allowed to settle, looped up five wide to make a mild bid
 but failed to sustain the drive. MISS KATIE BUG settled between horses, came five wide but failed to seriously threaten. PRAIRIE CITIZEN settled saving
 ground, steadied in traffic near the five-sixteenths pole, shifted out but went evenly. HAYNESFEST broke slow, moved up five wide, but faltered entering the

 unhurried, came three wide, checked hard between horses inside the three-sixteenths pole and came up empty thereafter. MO CHARA opened clear to set

 four wide, tucked in on the turn, came three wide and kicked on well to earn the place. TIZ TOO MUCH vied for the lead along the inside, was unable to go
 on with the winner, weakened further in the drive and settled for the show spot. TIZ THAT saved ground to some avail. STREET LIMIT failed to respond.
 ALL DAY TRIP disputed the pace two wide for a half and stopped.
