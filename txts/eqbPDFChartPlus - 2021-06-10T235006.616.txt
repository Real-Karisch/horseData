 D'WILDCAT SUNSHINE , rated well off the duel, circled the turn four wide, closed steadily outside foes and was up late. MARIE FROM PARIE hugged the
 inner rail, disputed the pace, opened a clear lead in mid stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. CHEROKEE FIRE stalked the
 duel, moved up three wide leaving the turn, took aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. OH SO LOVELY , along the inner rail entering the turn,
 eased out approaching the stretch, angled to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. DANCE OR STROLL saved ground on the turn and
 failed to be a factor. MARKET MONEY , sent to contention soon after the break, dueled outside MARIE FROM PARIE to the stretch then tired and retreated.

 left hand urging near the sixteenth pole and was kept to pressure in the drive. PAST PERFECT bobbled slightly at the break, raced three wide between
 horses on the turn, angled to the four path approaching the stretch and rallied. KNOCK OUT KID , snugly in hand along the rail entering the turn, saved
 ground around the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch and finished willingly. COME ON CALLIE , three wide on the turn, chased the pace and
 weakened. HAIL THE QUEEN , four deep on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and was not a factor. PARTY ON BOURBON raced along the inner rail
 much of the trip and was not a factor. ELYSIUM was outrun. SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE raced forwardly between horses leaving the backstretch and gave way in

 THE GREAT PROVIDER , rank when breaking awkwardly, rushed up between horses soon after the start, was challenged by AWESOME STANDARD
 entering the stretch and was under brisk urging in the drive. TURBIN circled the turn three wide and rallied. AWESOME STANDARD bid for the lead outside
 the winner entering the stretch and failed to sustain the move. HUMBOLT STREET stumbled leaving the starting gate, swung four deep entering the stretch
 and finished evenly. TENS WILD saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and was no threat. HUSH HUSH HENNY , unhurried
 down the backstretch, was not a factor. PROFESSOR ZOOM hugged the inner rail in the stretch and failed to rally. FIFTIES MUSIC chased the pace and
 gave way. YOUNG DUDE saved ground on the turn and gave way.

 ACCUSING prompted the early pace, dropped back between horses on the turn, raced in the three path in the stretch, aggressively split horses near the
 eighth pole then swept past DOWN IN THE HOLLER inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear. HIGH FLYING GUY , three wide entering the stretch, floated
 to the five path in upper stretch, advanced to the eighth pole then flattened out. DOWN IN THE HOLLER stalked the early pace, advanced four deep to take
 the lead turning for home and weakened late. PRAISE THE MOON , two wide entering the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, moved up a bit to the
 eighth pole then finished evenly. CHOCOMOUNT showed speed, saved ground on the turn and weakened. SOMEDREAMSCOMETRUE , along the rail
 around the turn, eased out to the two path for the drive and was steadied in tight quarters approaching the eighth pole. QUEST OF GLORY , three wide on
 the turn, drifted to the four path entering the stretch and faltered.

 HAYNE'S FEVER , six deep entering the first turn, advanced four wide leaving the far turn, gained the lead entering the stretch, opened a clear advantage
 in mid stretch and lasted under brisk urging. KIERLAND lacked speed, hugged the inner rail leaving the far turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch
 and rallied outside the winner. PATRIOT SAINT raced along the inner rail, challenged for the lead mid way on the far turn, again challenged for the lead
 approaching the eighth pole and faded late. MUCHO MAS GRANDE saved ground the far turn, angled to the five path turning for home and failed to be a
 threat. THE GREAT LOUDINI stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced four wide the first turn, advanced in the three path between horses on the far turn
