 back a bit on the turn, swung seven wide entering the stretch, closed once straightened and got up for place. REDNECK STRANGER pressed the pace, fell
 back on the turn, finished evenly and held safely for show. BAG MAN veered out at the start, raced outside early and lacked a bid. HUMID pressed the pace
 inside, fell back on the turn and faded through the stretch. MOSCOW SUMMIT was void of early speed, saved ground, got through along the rail on the turn
 and lacked a response. RED NECK KID was reluctant to load, raced outside, showed speed to the turn, fell back, went eight wide at the top of the stretch
 and stopped. The rider of REDNECK STRANGER claimed foul against the rider of CHASENSUMMERSTORMS for alleged interference on the turn. No
 change was made.

 KISS MY HENNESSY a bit reluctant to load, vied early, was checked on the turn dropping back then finished well while proving to be best. COZY BAR
 steadied on the turn in traffic, raced in the five path into the lane and finished willingly. REALLY BOPPIN between rivals early, pressed three deep turning for
 home and earned the show. MAYS OR MANTLE vied between rivals and weakened late. WILDCAT PARTY vied for command inside and also weakened
 late. MAXIMUM MAXIMUM raced just off the inside turning for home and lacked the needed bid. MY LITTLE TWEETY five wide into the turn, chased from
 the outside, raced in the four path entering the stretch and tired. HIGH ON FINAL was along the inside and checked on the turn dropping back.

 ROYAL PRIVACY broke in some then hustled early, set the pace and edged away through the final furlong. ESTIQAA saved ground on the turn, raced just
 off the inside into the lane and finished gamely while earning the place. REASONABLE PRIDE bid four wide on the turn, challenged for the lead three deep
 passing the quarter pole then needed more while being caught at the wire for the place. JILAS MIRACLE never far back and five wide into the stretch,
 needed more in the drive. DESERT MYSTERY three wide on the turn, raced between rivals turning for home while pressing the issue and weakened in the
 drive. BAROQUE in close at the start, lacked a rally. SON OF A ROYAL pressed early, saved ground and weakened through the lane. WINGS OF THE
 WIND saved ground and had no bid.

 close to the pace, went five wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed late response. SLAM A COCKTAIL raced in the back, offered a mild bid only and
