 Footnotes
 SLOVAK POWER vied for the lead two wide into the turn, continued with a short lead into the lane, slowly extended the advantage straightening in the lane,
 cleared outside the eighth pole and widened late. SEMINOLE JUSTICE was three wide through the turn when in close proximity, came into the lane from
 the four path, remained closest to the winner inside the eighth pole then could not gain and settled for second best. STARCASM was in the four path
 through the turn and into the lane, had aim on the top ones after straightening then could not gain further while best of the rest. MR ABERNATHY was in the
 two path through the turn, dropped to the inside into the lane then lacked a closing response. MILLION DOLLAR RED was off with a slight hop, raced well
 back through the turn while in the two path, angled widest for the drive and showed some interest far too late. PEBBLE'S REBEL vied for the lead along the
 inside through the turn, could not keep up into the lane then faded through the lane along the rail. DABITONME was never a factor while along the inside.
 MY MAN BECKETT was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and was done soon after. TIZA BIG INDIAN was off
 with a slight hop, raced far back while near the inside.

 Footnotes
 ZAMBIAN was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three to four path through the turn, split rivals while four wide entering the lane, quickly
 gained the lead, cleared then widened to the wire. MORNING STRIDE was unhurried while off the inside, raced from the two to the four path through the far
 turn, came into the lane six wide with momentum, looked as if might circle the field, chased the winner through the final eighth then battled back to recapture
 the place spot at the wire. ANOTHER was in the two path when tracking the leaders through the turn, came into the lane two wide, had aim on the top one
 straightening into the lane, could not make up ground on that one while edging up to the place spot inside the eighth pole then lost that position at the wire.
 MARZO tracked the pace along the inside through both turns and into the lane, was a threat outside the eighth pole then weakened. GO NAVY GO pressed
 the pace two wide into the lane then gave way. BIZERK was in the three path through the far turn and tired after turning into the lane. KEARNY COUNTY
 raced in the three path through the far turn when in mid-pack then was empty after straightening into the lane. BOLD PROPHET set the pace while under
 pressure and near the inside through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.
