 Footnotes
 STRONG BREEZE got bumped back at the start, moved up to track the top pair racing between rivals, continued in hand at the quarter pole, angled inside
 top stretch, quickly took command then held on in final strides over late charging runner up. DYNAMIC DANCER was slightly bumped at the start then
 continued up close three wide in second flight, fanned five wide entering top stretch, set sights on STRONG BREEZE, kicked in and was getting to the rival
 in final strides. STONE HEART raced off the early speed, circled up five to six wide entering top stretch, kept on with response and steadily advanced to
 gain show. DUEL AT DUSK raced on top under pressure then began to match strides along the inside of GRAY RANSOM, could not hold top spot when
 STRONG BREEZE kicked in top stretch, kept along but had no kick left in reserve. CAPE APACHE raced off the early speed, hustled up for response
 heading into the lane, lacked racing room and altered course in final sixteenth. GRAY RANSOM got bumped outward at the start, pressed then dueled for
 the lead racing along the outside of DUEL AT DUSK, could not keep up pace upper stretch and gaveway. NOBLE DAVE got bumped at the start then
 continued rated back off the pace, saved ground and moved into the lane near the inside, urged two to three wide showing mild response, raced in traffic
 then steadied nearing the wire. FIFTY EIGHT O G broke out and caused chain reaction of bumping, hustled up along the rail, reached midrange then
 steadily weakened in the lane.

 Footnotes
 HUNDRED YEAR STORM was well placed tracking the early leaders inside, came two wide into the lane, split horses in upper stretch and moved back to
 the rail overtaking MEGALIN CANDY, and held off FLASHY VAL while all out. FLASHY VAL raced two to three wide in midpack around the turn, swung four
 wide turning for home and finished well outside the winner to wind up just short. SOUTHERN N' SASSY ducked in at the start and was corrected after lightly
 brushing with the eventual winner, lagged well back to late on the turn, found her best stride along the rail in the stretch and was inching closer to the top
 two near the wire. MEGALIN CANDY dueled outside HAILING for three furlongs, got the best of that one into the stretch but weakened in the last eighth.
 TABLE OF ELEMENTS was positioned within easy striking range two to three wide around the turn but lacked a sufficient late response. MYRTLE ALLEN
 was outsprinted three to four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. TRUE TEMPTATION was off a step slow and lacked speed while saving ground
 throughout. CATASAURUS was four to five wide on the turn and didn't corner particularly well as she steadily lost ground. HAILING dueled for the lead
 along the inside and was finished in the stretch.

 ICONO steadily advanced position along the rail after the opening quarter, continued in range, lacked racing room through the turn, steadied then waited,
 tipped out four wide, quickly moved up to top pair, dug in and kicked clear. ENDURING ARCH was allowed to settle in opening quarter then moved up
 closer to front end, continued to rate two wide leaving the backstretch, urged to pick up the pace at the quarter pole then roused five wide at head of the
 lane, made slight contact with eventual winner, moved out couple paths then dug in and produced solid finish. THUNDER BUDDIES broke out at the start
 then moved up between rivals to challenge for the lead, continued to battle along the inside of PRINCE OF ENGLAND in the final furlong but lacked needed
 kick to move on with ICONO. PRINCE OF ENGLAND vied along the outside in opening stages then was taken under a hold to race just off top pair, moved
 back up to match strides midway through the turn, continued to battle along the outside then between when ICONIC moved up to challenge, had no kick left
 in reserve for deep stretch. COLORINCOLONEL raced off the early pace, hustled up along the outside approaching top stretch then drifted out wide while
 under right handed encouragement. KNIGHT ERRANT vied for the lead racing along the inside of rivals, continued to battle back running through the turn,
 could not match strides top stretch and gaveway. GET DOWN NICK got bumped between at the start, continued unhurried racing in the back, moved to the
 outside upper stretch then continued to drift out while offering no late run.

 right-handed a couple times. FRONTIER MARKET saved ground throughout while close behind the winner, stayed on the rail through the stretch and
 finished well to draw away from ALPHA TEAM for the place spot. ALPHA TEAM was hard-held early while tugging a bit just outside ALSAAL heading to the
 clubhouse turn, kept that one in his sights down the backstretch, came under urging with a quarter-mile remaining and was outfinished by the top two.
 TRAVIS COUNTY saved ground around both turns, moved up a bit into the lane and continued on evenly while never a threat. MR CHAPLIN raced two
 wide on the turns, came three wide into the stretch and finished evenly. SECOND STREET was on the rail early, went two wide around the far turn and was
 never involved. SALUTATION chased three wide, was put to a drive on the far turn and steadily gave way.

 Footnotes
 KISS THE CROWN tracked the top pair and continued patiently in hand at the quarter pole, shifted out three to four wide top stretch, continued driving to the
 lead, dug in along the outside of INDOMINUS then moved away. INDOMINUS pressed in opening stages then began to duel for the lead, continued to
 match strides racing along the outside of FULFILLED FANTASY into the lane, took on late challenge of KISS THE CROWN, dug back in stubbornly but
 could not move on in deep stretch. BISTRO MONCUR broke out and bumped with rival at the start, continued in or near the back, roused three wide top
 stretch, finished with good response and continued gaining to the wire. FULFILLED FANTASY broke sharp on top to take commanding lead, quickly came
 under pressure from INDOMINUS, dueled along the inside of rival running through the turn, cut the corner entering stretch, briefly regained the edge then
 fought back into late drive, could not move on with top pair but fought back for share then lost show in final strides. PIRA raced between rivals in the second
 flight, edged back from between approaching top stretch, shifted out five wide a furlong out, continued with response and narrowly missed show. TALITHA
 KOUM hustled up along the rail in early stages, cut the corner entering the lane, made mild two to three wide move then lacked needed kick to move on.
 MEETING FRANCIS sat off the early speed, came under a ride racing along the outside, brushed rival mid-stretch, kept on and finished evenly. STARSHIP
 REINA advanced after opening stages to race along outside in the second flight, continued driving in contention entering the lane then flattened late.
 AUGUST LILLY stumbled shortly after the start, continued off the early speed, showed response while rousing along the outside entering the upper stretch,
 continued six wide bid then got bumped a bit and failed to move on. QUICK AVALANCHE raced in early contention then got in tight between, steadied back
 then failed to regain.

 Footnotes
 SADIE BE GOOD was fractious in the gate waiting for the rest of the field to load, yet broke alertly and was quickly clear, saved ground gradually widening
 the lead into the stretch under some urging and remained well clear under a mild hand ride late. LOXLEY was hustled a bit to stay close early inside,
 remained on the rail through the stretch while finishing well and galloped out strongly past the wire. NOTHIN BUT TROUBLE broke a step slow, saved
 ground early and into the turn, came two wide into the lane on the way to being taken further out, and strode through the final furlong a bit greenly on the
 wrong lead. ITHINKITS MONDAY chased outside the winner to the stretch and gave way through the last furlong. PARTY TARDE was three to four wide on
 the turn, and wider still while being outsprinted into the lane. NOVEMBERTOREMEMBER chased between horses early, went three wide into the turn while
 losing ground, drifted wide turning for home and was not persevered with while clearly spent. FASHION FACTOR raced toward the inside and showed no
 speed.

 Footnotes
 MISTY BALLERINA sat just off the early pacesetter then edged up approaching the quarter pole to challenge CAN YOU SEE ME for the lead, dueled along
 the outside of rival in upper stretch then took command and kept clear. CAN'TCATCHTHERAXX slightly hopped at the start then raced in range along the
 outside, roused three wide upper stretch, moved up off the eventual winner and kept on under steady urging to finish second best. ATLANTIC GUSTO
 bumped the gate at the start then sat off the early speed, picked up the pace along the outside at the quarter pole, began to drift out while continuing to gain
 to the wire. MISTY SPIRIT raced off the early pace while saving ground along the inside, moved out and around pulling up rival midway through the turn,
 moved out couple paths upper stretch and continued steady three wide bid to gain minor share. CAN YOU SEE ME moved up to take the lead steps after
 the start, held narrow margin then edged away to clear lead, came under challenge from eventual winner midway through the turn, fought back then failed to
 move on and gaveway a furlong out. BEYOND DETECTION was strongly urged from the gate and moved up close from outside post, quickly lost ground on
 top pair, continued inside bid then steadily weakened into the lane. ICY'S SURPRISE raced off the pace, entered top stretch three wide under a drive and
 failed to move into threatening range. LA BLONDY steadied at the start when outside rival moved in, continued reserved in back along the outside through
 the backstretch then lacked a needed rally in the lane. STOP THE DRAMA raced near the back, kept along the outside in the turn and failed to move into
 contention. CANDU CAIT raced in early contention along the inside then was quickly pulled up midway through the turn and vanned off after the race.

 Footnotes
 IZZY THE WARRIOR chased four wide while losing a bit of ground on the turn, kept to his task after being straightened away for the stretch run and was
 along late outside. LOOKIN FOR A KISS lost some ground while along the rail into the turn, moved closer while still on the fence coming to upper stretch,
 split horses late and just missed. LEX VEGAS was hustled along from the rail to duel for the lead with TOWN POLICY, shook that one off approaching the
 stretch, but shortened stride late after neglecting to change leads. EXPRESS JET was slow away from the gate and outsprinted two wide into the turn, was
 taken well out in the track in the lane and offered a belated run while no threat, then unseated his rider galloping back and ran off for a furlong or so before
 being apprehended. MAJESTIC SLEW eyed the duelers three wide into the turn with dead aim, remained in contention to the furlong marker, but faltered
 while racing a bit erratically the last sixteenth. TOWN POLICY battled for the lead outside LEX VEGAS, could not keep pace with that rival late on the turn
 and faded. UNCLE JERRY trailed throughout inside.

 Footnotes
 CLASSIC ROCK broke sharp from the outside post and quickly moved up to the lead, continued under a snug hold with MY FRIEND applying early
 pressure from the inside, moved away from rival without asking then steadily widened advantage on top, posted quick early fractions and continued on top
 in hand approaching top stretch, felt rivals closing in, shook the reins then came under right handed encouragement and continued on top. BEASLEY raced
 in range running through the backstretch, commenced three wide bid rounding out the turn, continued driving while gaining on eventual winner but could not
 get to rival in time and settled for second best. UNION BRASS was rated off the early pace while positioned three to four wide off the inside, picked up the
 pace in the turn, came under strong right handed urging top stretch, continued with steady response and secured show. SPEEDMEISTER bobbled at the
 start then continued settled back near the inside, entered top stretch two wide then shifted to outside and gained position. ARRECIFE raced in the back
 while saving ground along the rail, cut the corner entering the lane, moved out couple paths then finished with response and gained position. MY FRIEND
 applied early pressure to outside running CLASSIC ROCK, could not keep up quick pace with rival but remained in contention, continued in pursuit along
 the outside in upper stretch then evened out. TALE OF SILENCE raced off the early pace, tapped on the shoulder leaving the backstretch, moved up into
 contention, roused between rivals at the quarter pole, kept on upper stretch then flattened out. LOOKIN AT BLESSING stumbled at the start then continued
 near the back three to four wide off the inside, hustled up entering the lane then lacked a needed rally for impact. ALUM raced in early contention then came
 up empty after the half.

 Footnotes
 VENOM GIRL was forwardly placed pressing the pace three wide, challenged outside LUCKY BELLA turning for home and drew clear late after a struggle.
 LUCKY BELLA was away in good order to vie for the lead toward the inside, came into the stretch in the two-path with VENOM GIRL right alongside, and
 battled gamely to deep stretch to remain clear of the others. BATTLE TALE raced in midpack early, gradually came off the inside to be four wide into the
 lane and finished willingly. INFILTRADA raced well back for six furlongs, swung out four wide into the stretch and rallied mildly past tired horses. LITTLE
 CATON raced on the rail within range for six furlongs and had no further response. HY RAPID LADY pressed the pace outside LUCKY BELLA for six
 furlongs and tired. REIGN IT IN moved closer to the leaders four wide on the turn and tired badly. B L'S WAGON was within striking distance four wide into
 the turn and dropped back. JUST COZ was three wide on the turn, moved inside for the drive and couldn't gain. VINYARDNINA began dropping back into
 the turn and was done soon afterward. SUMMERTIME MUSIC couldn't keep pace leaving the backstretch. CATIRA ROCK was up close between horses,
 pulled up after going wrong on the backstretch and was vanned off.
