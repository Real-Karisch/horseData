 KAIJU set a pressured pace along the inside, bore out under left hand whip through late stretch and held stubbornly. EL PISTOLERO bobbled slightly
 leaving the gate, pressed outside the winner throughout but wasn't quite enough. OWIN I AM came out into HANDSOME BOY leaving the gate then came
 in on RUMFIRE, bumped with RUMFIRE midway on the backstretch, had position in the three path but lacked the needed closing. RUMFIRE was bumped
 just after the break, raced two wide and outfinished tired ones. HANDSOME BOY was bumped after the break then again midway on the backstretch, raced
 the four path around the turn and weakened. SPIRITS LEGACY broke in the air then tired inside.

 I SCREAM SUNDAY wasn't far back inside early, steadied while lacking room behind the leaders approaching the lane, angled outside in early stretch then
 rallied to the front in deep stretch. BARN DUTY broke in the air, pressed outside the early leader, moved two wide to command entering the stretch and
 gave way late. MAGGIE LAINE made the pace along the rail to the stretch then continued with good courage once displaced. FROSTY GIRL raced the
 three path around the turn then continued evenly between rivals in the lane. MY FAVORITE CITY advanced outside early, raced three wide around the turn
 then weakened. SOBEIT SYLVIA was no factor inside. TIZA WEIGELIA stumbled leaving the gate then reared up a bit, circled widest into the stretch but
 couldn't gain.
