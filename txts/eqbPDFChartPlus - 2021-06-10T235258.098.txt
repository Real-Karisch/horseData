 READY TO FIGHT came out of the gate awkwardly, settled to chase the pace inside, began to rally near the seven sixteenths marker, hugged the rail to the
 quarter pole, swung three wide and continued to advance, and cleared in the final fifty yards. PLAYRAWAN pressed the pace while in the three path on the
 turn, struck the front from near the three eighths marker, carried the lead past the sixteenth pole but just failed to last. TACO GRANDE broke outwards
 bumping FLIGHT MISSION in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the five path on the turn, began to rally near the five sixteenths marker,
 fanned into the stretch in the seven path, improved under a drive late but proved no match for the top two. AGGRO CRAG (IRE) tracked the pace inside
 early, raced in the five path on the turn, and ran evenly in the lane. HAMMERS THIRSTY broke sharp, led while saving ground into the turn, was headed
 near the three eighths marker, and weakened inside down the lane. MISCHIEF N VALUE chased near the rear early, dropped to the rail near the three
 eighths marker, but offered no rally. FLIGHT MISSION was bumped by TACO GRANDE in the opening strides, chased two wide after some early urging,
 took the turn in the six path, and came up empty in the lane.

 ARTIC VORTEX tracked off the leading pair, raced three wide into the turn, bid in earnest near the seven sixteenths, led from the five sixteenths mark, and
 went well clear while kept to the task. VALID OFFER chased in the four path on the turn, launched a rally from the three eighths marker, and ran on a clear
 second best. LADY DOZER settled at the rear, raced in the three path on the turn, swung into the six path in the lane, and improved on the far outside.
 SANILAC was sent early, stalked the leader, pressed the pace in the two path on the turn, had no answer to ARTIC VORTEX nearing the five sixteenths
 marker, kept on into the stretch but flattened out. DUNDALK BAY broke sharply but settled near the rear, raced in the five path on the turn, brought up the
 rear into the lane but passed tiring horses late. CHANCEYMEETINUHERE was sent to the lead along the inside, took pressure from SANILAC, was headed
 by both that foe and ARTIC VORTEX near the five sixteenths, and weakened inside. APPOLLOS BABY GIRL chased midpack inside, saved ground

 DESIERTO showed early foot, settled to stalk the pace, made a bid and took the lead in the three path at the half mile pole, held command from there and
 was safe under a drive. BRUISE chased the early pace inside, angled off the rail at the three eighths to launch a three wide bid, and ran on well in the lane
 while no match for the winner. SPANISH COYOTE broke inward bumping GRAN DUQUE, chased the pace, made a three-wide bid on the turn, and ran
 evenly late. HANNITY tracked the pace while saving ground, but lacked the needed rally late. PHOENIX BOUND sent to a clear lead inside, was headed at
 the half mile mark, and faded. TRUMPIFIED settled at the rear of the field, saved ground through the second turn, and passed tiring horses. GRAN DUQUE
 was bumped by SPANISH COYOTE in the opening strides, settled near the rear, raced in the four path on the second turn, and never factored. ALPHA

 raced in the three path on the turn, maintained her advantage gamely into the lane, and kicked away under a drive in the final furlong while drifting out.
 ROYAL CITY was reluctant to load and anxious in the gate, broke outwardly to lightly bump DAYIN DEAUVILLE in the opening strides, tracked the early
 pace three wide, stalked in the four path on the turn, and ran on well to clear the rest of the field though she could not pass the winner.
 MILLIONDOLLARHIWAY settled near the rear early, made a bid from the three eighths mark while in the three path, fanned into the stretch in the seven
 path, and rallied while no match for the top two. EILEEN EVELYN settled inside, raced in the three path on the turn while improving position mildly, came
 into the stretch three wide, and ran along mildly. POSH RULER chased inside, saved ground through the turn, came off the rail to evade a fading horse near
 the five sixteenths, and ran evenly late. TIME FOR PARADING trailed in the four path around the turn, and passed tiring horses late. DAYIN DEAUVILLE
 was bumped lightly by ROYAL CITY in the opening strides, chased the pace two wide early, raced in the six path on the turn, and did not rally. B N A
