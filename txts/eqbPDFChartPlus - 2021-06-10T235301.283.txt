 never far back with a late run outside for show. BARELY SHACK chased to turn, dueled to deep stretch, garnered a short lead but weakened in the drive.
 WHERE EAGLES FLY good position to stretch, lacked late response in the drive. SCARLET WINE raced wide into the stretch while no menace. J R
 THUNDER close up outside but lacked late response when needed. TWICE ON SUNDAY raced wide into the stretch, no late gain. KID ORY sprinted clear

 and failed to menace. SAIL WEST had a terrible start, rushed outside with a mild middle move but finished poorly in the stretch while lugging in. SLICK RED
