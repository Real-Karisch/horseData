 the pace leaving the backstretch then shifted out at head of the lane, set down for the drive and finished with good energy. DINO DUDE held slim lead in
 first turn then set pressured pace through the backstretch, shook off HALF GREY and dueled for lead with FAMILY JUSTICE, continued to battle back
 gamely then got outkicked by eventual winner deep stretch and lost place in final stride. FAMILY JUSTICE pressed early pace then edged back briefly,

 Footnotes
 DANCING NOELLE pressed the pace outside INDIAN MYTH, wrested command nearing the quarter-pole, rapidly pulled clear through upper stretch, was
 roused left-handed twice past the furlong marker, and was hand-ridden the last 70 yards. ZARABANDA came three wide off the turn, and finished willingly to
 overtake INDIAN MYTH for the runner-up spot in deep stretch. INDIAN MYTH hustled up to the lead after bobbling at the start, was hounded by DANCING
 NOELLE for nearly a half-mile, proved no match turning for home, and lost the place late. WEST COAST MISS was slow into stride, moved toward the rail
 heading to the turn, swung back out four wide by the top of the lane, and could not gain. MAGNATO GO lost her footing at the start, chased the leaders to
 the turn but could not keep up with five-sixteenths remaining.

 Footnotes
 GALILEO'S AFFAIR bumped bit with RUN GAL RUN steps after the start then settled and saved ground along inside, angled out and picked up pace three
 furlongs out, swept by ROCKET QUEEN leaving quarter pole then drew off easily and geared down late. UP THE ROAD was unhurried and raced in the
 back, came under ride along rail going through the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but dug in and gain runner up spot. BLACKWYNN hit the gate
 at the start then raced off early pace positioned along outside, came under ride three wide in the turn, showed response then kept on three deep at eighth
 pole, lost runner up and secured share. JUBILANT was rated in range racing four to five wide through the backstretch, sent driving five wide into lane then
 drifted out wider and lacked needed kick for late impact. ROCKET QUEEN quickly cleared the lead and angled inside to save ground, set the uncontested
 pace throughout the backstretch then was no match when eventual winner moved by leaving the quarter pole, kept along trying to hold share but came up
 empty in final furlong. TINCA'S BIRD was nearest pursuer of leader running through the backstretch then failed to keep up pace in turn, retreated and
 finished wide in the lane. RUN GAL RUN bumped with eventual winner just after the start then raced in early contention before dropping far back.

 Footnotes
 CREATIVE TALENT sprinted clear soon after the start, widened the advantage as the rider took a peek back late on the turn, continued to draw out under a
 drive through the furlong grounds, and was hand-ridden late. DREAMING OF ACA raced two wide into the turn, cut over to the rail at the three-eighths pole,
 and edged away from the rest of the field through the drive. KABUKI chased three wide around the turn, could not keep pace with the winner approaching
 the lane, and kept on evenly. E Z'S MISTRESS lacked speed early inside, came three wide off the turn and posed no threat. MISS STALWART broke open
 the gate and unseated her rider prior to the start, came away in good order, chased the winner two wide under a drive through the turn, and tired. STAR

 Footnotes
 MIDNIGHTONBROADWAY vied for the lead coming out of the chute then contested pace racing along outside of SHOOTIST, took clear command still
 unasked midway through far turn, roused for more at head of the lane, responded willingly and drew off under. SHOOTIST vied for lead coming out of the
 chute, continued under pressure holding slim lead over MIDNIGHTONBROADWAY throughout the backstretch, could not move on with rival midway
 through turn, kept along and just lasted for runner up spot. LITTLE SKY was rated four wide through the backstretch, showed response when asked running
 along rail in the turn, moved off inside and kept under ride, just missed place. EL CHAVAL raced five to six wide off early pace, came out wider leaving the
 backstretch, continued wide into drive and showed some late interest to improve position. SANAD was restless at break and came away step slow then got
 pinched back, hustled up and raced up close three wide just off top pair, came under ride but lost ground on top pair in turn, raced along outside without
 threatening in lane. TRAFFIC EXPRESS got brushed at the start then raced four wide in contention, continued hustled up through far turn then failed to kick
 on in the lane. WILD FORCE raced off the pace then dropped far back, eased to wire and walked off after the race. CIRCLE CITY was never involved,
 eased to wire and walked off after race. EYE OF THE LION raced in contention then quickly pulled up in turn, vanned off after race.

 Footnotes
 CHANGEWILLDOYAGOOD was bumped by BARNEY REBEL at the start, cleared to the inside with the lead soon after, rated along comfortably setting
 measured fractions, was roused to extend the margin through upper stretch, and turned back GLOBAL ENTRY through the closing yards. GLOBAL ENTRY
 broke out at the start bumping BARNEY REBEL into CHANGEWILLDOYAGOOD, settled off the early pace two wide, gradually shifted to higher gears three
 wide around the far turn and into the stretch, closed steadily and came up just short. WHAT POWER broke outward at the start, chased after the pacesetter
 two wide, ran on willingly between horses through deep stretch, but was outkicked. KABANG was forced out at the start, settled well off the leaders two wide
 for six furlongs, began moving three wide late on the turn, shifted to the four-path for the drive and slowly narrowed the gap on the far outside. BARNEY
 REBEL (IRE) was bumped between horses at the start, saved ground throughout and lacked a final surge. TWO STEP TIME reared at the start and was off
 slowly, moved off the rail to the two-path on the far turn, and could not reach contention. BIRD HUMOR lacked speed, fanned wide coming off the far turn
 and remained outrun.

 Footnotes
 SILVER DEFENSE was bumped between horses at the start, split foes aggressively up the backstretch, got to the turn in the clear three wide, caught
 TOWN POLICY at the quarter-pole and drew off under a drive. RANGER IN PARADISE saved ground to the stretch, moved off the rail a furlong out, and
 ran down TOWN POLICY for second. TOWN POLICY broke out bumping SILVER DEFENSE at the start, dueled inside SMALL FORTUNE early, could not
 go with SILVER DEFENSE coming off the turn, and lost second late. EKHLAAS raced two wide for nearly a half-mile, came three wide for the drive and did
 not menace. SMALL FORTUNE bumped with SILVER DEFENSE at the start, dueled outside TOWN POLICY early, then weakened between horses after a
 half-mile. IZZY THE WARRIOR raced three wide and was always outrun. MY FRIEND raced wide and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 NO SWEAT led into the first turn, then yielded and opted to stalk inside entering the backstretch, was put to pressure moving off the rail nearing the
 quarter-pole, found her best stride three wide into upper stretch, caught WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT from the outside and drove clear. PRINCESS VICTORIA
 settled in the middle of the field two wide early, cut the corner turning for home, shifted off the fence and was up late for second. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT
 hustled up four then three wide into the first turn to go after NO SWEAT, came away with the lead and moved inside for the backstretch run, drifted off the
 rail leaving the far turn, yielded to the winner, then lost the place late. MY COUSIN MARTHA trailed for six furlongs, raced three then two wide around the
 far turn, and improved position while never a factor. DEVILISH ROMANCE raced three to four wide throughout, and dropped back after six furlongs.
 COLORINCOLONEL moved inside after a two-wide run around the first turn, and did not reach contention. DRIVER'S GIRL stumbled at the start, was
 guided off the inside to force the pace three wide heading to the backstretch, and remained prominent to the far turn before dropping back.

 STROLL ACTION contested the early pace then took command still unasked at the quarter pole, came under a ride and continued with good response to
 hold clear. PRETTY SHEA D was rated five wide just off early pace, hustled up in the turn then made solid run for eventual winner, could not get to rival
 then finished well clear over rest. SECOND ILLUSION got pushed in and off slow at the start, lacked early speed then hustled up two to three wide in the
 turn, gained and secured share in the lane. SPECIAL COUNSEL vied for early lead with eventual winner, could not move on with rival three furlongs out
 then faded in the lane. HURRICANE ROBERTA raced off early pace near the inside, moved outside in the turn then floated out very wide losing ground,
 passed tiring foes in the lane. BEST OF ENEMIES chased pace along rail, cut the corner and kept under drive along rail upper stretch then faded.
 CHRISTIANITY raced in range three path between rivals at half mile marker then failed to keep pace in turn, retreated. TOTAL TREASURE showed
 response racing five wide running through the backstretch then failed to move on in the turn. CHANTILLY LILLY chased two wide at half mile marker,
 continued driving two to three wide in the then turn then dropped back in the lane. ITSJUSTNOTYOURDAY briefly loose before loading, bolted at the start,
 continued wide far back, straightened out in lane to no avail. RED SAILS hustled up along outside, failed to respond. HINDI drifted in at the start and trailed.
