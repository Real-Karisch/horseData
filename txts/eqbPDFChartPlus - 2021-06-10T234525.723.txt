 Footnotes
 RB HOT DATE chased the early pace under strong urging, made an outside bid at the half-mile pole, vied in the three path on the turn, dueled with the
 runner-up in the stretch and prevailed under strong urging. BURNING CHARM set the pace under some urging, raced near the inside on the turn, dueled
 with the winner in the stretch and missed while clear for the place. CR ARDIENTE was urged along off the pace, moved in late on the backstretch, rounded
 the turn in the two path and lacked the needed kick while best of the rest. CHNDAKASEXPRESS was urged along off the pace, dropped back in the four
 path on the turn and came up empty. WMA SPECIAL ROSE rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. RICH CRAFT broke out at the start, saved
 ground near the back and never reached contention. MY THUNDER BOLT was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and was no factor.
 SPOOK AA pressed the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, came up empty on the turn and stopped. MBA DESERT SAWDUST went three to four
 wide on the turn and was outrun.
