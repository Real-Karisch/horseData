 YOU'LL BE LUCKY was well placed off the leader to the second turn, rallied two wide and pushed up to draw even in mid stretch then continued to respond
 and edged clear. SON OF THE SOUTH broke alertly but was outsprinted, stalked to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch then came on
 late for the place. LIL AWECIM hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then went evenly and was outkicked for
 the place. DEFENSE MINISTER got outsprinted for a half mile, was fanned four wide on the second turn and lacked the needed late response. DARE TO
 BELIEVE had no speed and was not a threat.

 Footnotes
 SHE BEGAN AGAIN was outrun to the turn, advanced two wide to the stretch then rallied when set down, caught THE LAST RULE leaving the furlong
 grounds and edged away driving. THE LAST RULE broke clean, set the pace off the the rail to the stretch, responded to pressure to mid stretch then could
 not stall the winner. JESSTASTIC pressed the pace to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and just saved the show.
 COLONEL DEERING was rank in the early stages and hard to place, raced inside horses in traffic to the turn then was trying to get out, steadied hard at the
 five sixteenths to avoid heels, was two wide to the stretch then showed some interest late. MARIE'S MYSTERE had no speed, circled rivals five wide to the
 stretch but could not threaten late. OVATION chased the pace to the turn, came four wide to the stretch and weakened. THAT'S MY GAL was outsprinted to
 the turn and never a threat.

 Footnotes
 INVERTIGO was content to race in the rear of the pack to the second turn, responded when roused into the second turn had to swing out five then six deep
 into the stretch, rallied when set down, did not switch leads in the drive but closed best to prevail. DIZZY DANCER settled mid pack to the second turn,
 saved ground to the stretch, loomed a threat inside to mid stretch then was outkicked for the win but gamely saved the place. RAINBOW NORTH was sent
 for speed and set the pace in the two path to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then finished evenly and could not hold second. CAROLINA ISLAND was
 settled to the half, rallied three wide on the second turn, pushed up to engage the leader in mid stretch but lost his punch in the late stages. GURNICK had
 no speed, raced just inside the winner to the second turn then did not offer the needed late response. TRIBAL AGAIN chased the pace to the second turn,
 was caught out four then five wide to the stretch and weakened. MIMIS BIG BOY pressed the pace for six furlongs while three wide but tired in the drive.
 WHOA BOY stalked the pace to the second turn then gave out.
