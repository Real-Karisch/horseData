 Footnotes
 MY DARK SECRET was restless in the gate,tracked three wide between rivals through the first turn, was under a tight hold down the backstretch, made a
 three wide bid for the lead outside the dueling leaders at the five-sixteenths pole, then prevailed through the stretch duel. PATTI PATTI PATTI dueled two
 wide down the backstretch and inched a slight lead into the far turn, received a challenge and was headed by an outer rival at the quarter pole, dug in for the
 stretch duel between rivals, but was bested. NYMUE'S TREASURE dueled along the inside before being headed by her dueling rival into the far turn, fought
 on gamely to the wire, but gave way late. MALEFICENT QUEEN trailed to upper stretch while saving ground and made a mild inside rally in the stretch.
 MAGNETIC SPOT gain ground in the four path through the first turn, sat in range while three wide down the backstretch, but got outmoved by the eventual
 winner at the three-eighths pole and was flat through the lane. MORTY rated in the pocket but weakened around the far turn.

 Footnotes
 DANCE THE DAY AWAY raced far back early on, but made a three wide advance starting at the five furlong marker, sustained her rally through the turn,
 went four wide into the lane and reached the lead at the sixteenth pole before drawing off in the final stages. YANKEE ROSE broke very sharply and quickly
 cleared away from her rivals, maintained her clear advantage through the turn, but was headed inside the eighth pole and subsequently gave way.
 GRAVEYARD SHIFT was scrubbed on early while racing in midpack along the inside, then retreated into the turn before, receiving a hard drive at the
 five-sixteenths pole, then found her stride and rallied along the rail through the stretch for show. HASSLE trailed early, raced five to three wide through the
 turn, shifted to the five path into the lane and grinded along while on her left lead. EXTRAVAGANT LASS chased the pace setter two wide, but made no
 headway and weakened through the lane. GENNY GENNY stalked three wide, but weakened in upper stretch while on her left lead TOO SHORT dropped
 her rider in the post parade, then broke well, but was readily outpaced.

 YELLAH was outsprinted in the early stages as the leaders sprinted away, gained ground into the turn and split rivals at the three-eighths pole, angled three
 wide outside of the leaders at the furlong marker, kept on and got up late. MERRIE GOGO tracked her stablemate from the two path, bid against her at the
 five-sixteenths pole, led into the lane and put her inner rival away in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer rival inside final sixteenth. FANCY KELLY cut
 the pace along the inside, but was headed at the five-sixteenths pole before giving way and weakening inside the final eighth. LOVELY LADY LINDA was
 bumped after the start, then advanced to a striking position into the turn, but weakened at the five-sixteenths pole. LIEBCHEN had a tardy start, then saved
 ground to no avail. NUTNBUTAROXSTAR stalked three wide early on, but was outpaced to the turn, and steadily faded thereafter.

 Footnotes
 PRODUCER vied two wide between horses, but took up in tight quarters around the first turn, then angled out and forged a lead at the five furlongs marker,
 maintained a clear advantage through the far turn and kicked further away in upper stretch. ST. RONANS tracked along the inside, then split rivals at the six
 furlongs pole and bid at the half mile pole, stayed in range to the quarter pole, but was no match for the leader in upper stretch. TROCKETTE raced far
 back, saved ground both turns and made an inside rally through the far turn, but never threatened the winner. JENNYSREGALMAN stalked four wide
 through the first turn, was put to a drive and the nine-sixteenths pole, then stayed on, but was no menace. BOASTFUL BOY vied along the inside, but was
 outpaced into the far turn and faded. SPECTACULARXCHANGE dwelt at the start, lagged well behind the field and passed tired rivals in the lane. TOLL
 GUARD was never involved. SKELETON KEY set the pace in the two path, got headed at the five-furlong marker and faded thereafter.

 Footnotes
 TRIGZ broke well and quickly cleared, maintained an uncontested lead through the far turn and widened his margin through deep stretch. WARRANT
 OFFICER was reluctant to load, chased along the inside, forged place as MOMMA'S PRIDE drifted out at the quarter pole and proved second best. BIG
 LEMON trailed to the turn, made an inside gain through the turn and a rail rally in the stretch while running greenly on her left lead. MOMMA'S PRIDE
 chased two wide, drifted three to four wide into the lane, then weakened on his left lead in upper stretch before drifting in at the eighth pole. TRY TRY
 AGAIN reared in the gate, then raced far back, saved ground and was no factor. CARUSO broke in and hit the gate, then faltered to last into the turn and
 never contended.

 BIG LEGACY broke on top, took back early to track the pace setters four to three wide, was roused and bid strongly at the quarter pole, then kicked away in
 upper stretch. BEAUKATI took back between horses to track from off the pace, went five wide into the lane and rallied for place. SWAMP RULER had a
 tardy start, went six wide into the lane, trailed to deep stretch and passed tired rivals. E Z MOON dueled three to two wide, recieved bid to his outside at the
 quarter pole, was swiftly outkicked by that rival while between horses and weakened thereafter. HOW'S MY BUD stalked up close along the ins, raced in the
 pocket through the turn, but lost position as the leader tired in front of him, then swung four wide into the lane and came up empty. WILDCAT LITE dueled
 along the inside, was driven and got headed at the quarter pole, then subsequently tired.
