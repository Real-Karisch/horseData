 Footnotes
 THEGRAYSPIDER close up early from the inside, inched closer up the backstretch, altered outside entering the second turn, dueled through the second
 turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole and steadily drew clear while lightly roused. HALO'S MAJESTY well placed from the inside, advanced through
 the second turn, altered outside for the drive, responded but could only gain the place. MISS AVA CLAIRE chased the early pace from the outside, steadily
 advanced up the backstretch, responded when sat down for the drive and rallied late for the show. MONARCHOS PRAYER broke sharp from between foes,
 quickly gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, dueled with the winner through the second turn but had nothing for the drive. OUT LATE
 could only pass tired ones. HOT AND READY was no factor. WESTEX chased the early pace and tired. TRINTRIN was finished after going a half.
