 Footnotes
 ROBUSTO stalked the pace, came through the turn along the rail then two-wide, chased into the stretch, rallied determinedly and was up late under a drive.
 TRUE DAT raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, rallied outside and just missed. WOLF RIDGE pulled to the early lead, set a
 pressured pace from the rail, moved clear on the turn but was caught in deep stretch. DYNAMIC FORCE settled at the back of the pack, closed along the
 rail through the turn, launched an all out drive and gained steadily to the end. MEET CUTE, at the rear early, closed five then four-wide on the turn but
 leveled out in the final 16th. KRPAN forced the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished evenly. SYNERGIZED
 forced the early pace, dropped back three and four-wide through the turn then lacked a closing response. BLESSED TWO, in mid pack early, was hustled
 four and five-wide on the turn from the back of the pack and had no response in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 BELLS OF WAR was three wide contesting the lead early, allowed a rival up the rail to take command into the turn, put that one away as they turned for
 home and sprinted clear at the furlong pole, only the margin of victory in doubt late. EMPIRE ANGEL was brushed by a rival at the start,dueled between
 early, took back to stalk late backstretch, came out in upper stretch and closed willingly but the winner was long gone. WIDE AWAKE was along the rail
 being hard held early, stayed in range until angling out by the furlong pole and did just enough running late to hang on to the show spot. MEET MICHELLE
 missed the break losing about four lengths, stayed inside and moved up gradually to reach midpack on the turn, then continued to close ground willingly to
 the wire. LEA RO was off the pace and attempting to move up when steadied midway on the turn, then angled out from inside in upper stretch and closed
 widest to finish in okay fashion. SHES THE NORTH was in mid pack in range while two wide on the turn, no rally forthcoming down the stretch while running
 in place. JUMPING JILL FLASH rushed up inside to set a pressured pace late backstretch and around the turn, was headed as they approached the top of
 the stretch and backed up from that point to the wire. YOURS TRULY was squeezed back and taken up hard early, trailed the field until passing a couple
 tired foes in the stretch while widest. HOLY SELENA was off the pace, came three to four wide on the turn while trying to rally but never reached contention,
 failing to change leads the entire stretch. DEARFUTUREHUSBAND broke out at the start brushing a rival, was in range three wide on the turn but began to
 fall back at the quarter pole and retreated through the pack.

 COOLER MIKE raced in mid pack, closed on the backstretch, seeing the run away leader drifting out on the far turn the pair quickened and battled for the
 lead. COOLER MIKE drove clear in the final furlong and held rivals safe under steady pressure. THOR'S ROCKET raced in mid pack, was hustled in striking
 range while four-wide on the final turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. ROYAL LASER settled in mid pack, saved ground
 while stalking the pace on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely between rivals. MAGICAL MAN stalked the pace in hand, closed on the
 backstretch, dueled through the turn, yielded in the final furlong and gave way grudgingly. DUN DRUM rated off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide
 on the far turn then chased through the stretch. SPLIT MY PANTS settled off the pace, closed along the rail on the far turn, chased into the stretch but failed
 to menace. ESKIMINZIN took the early lead with ease, set the pace but began to run off approaching the backstretch, continued until drifting into the far
 turn, ran six to eight wide on the turn, was eased up at the top of the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

 Footnotes
 MARCH OF DREAMS trailed the field into the far turn, circled the field three to four wide and made the front as they turned for home, sprinting clear by the
 furlong marker and held that advantage to the wire. MAGIC RIVER was bumped by a rival at the start, chased an open length leader into the backstretch,
 closed the gap to stalk and bid for the front early on the far turn, had a brief lead outside the quarter pole but was immediately tackled by the winner, then
 held the place spot gamely late. ROYAL WEDDING got an inside trip, closed up the rail in behind a quartet of leaders at the quarter pole, dropped back in
 upper stretch but angled out at the furlong pole and finished willingly. SHE'S A TRUE FOX settled in midpack, in the two path behind a wall of horses at the
 quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch and passed a couple of tired foes late with a steady rally. CORTADO BAY broke out at the start and bumped a rival,
 was headstrong and hard to control on an open length lead into the backstretch, headed midway on the far turn and retreated down the lane. POST TO
 POST was three wide throughout, advanced to make it three in a line midway on the far turn, started to drop back as the field turned for home and retreated
 down the lane.

 Footnotes
 BROADWAY BONNIE broke outward and settled in mid pack, closed two-wide and along the rail late turn, rallied determinedly and was up in the final yards
 under a drive. COPPER FOX broke inward and bumped FAT N BITTER, had command early on the turn, set the pace, drew away upper stretch but was
 caught near the wire. FOREST HALO was bumped by FAT N BITTER and in turn bumped SAN NICOLA STORM, gained position in striking range, closed
 three-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. SAN NICOLA STORM was bumped and pinched back at the outset then settled off the pace,
 angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied between rivals. BELLA FIGURA stalked the pace from the rail, was shuffled back along the rail
 when CRY UNCLE was taken back in front of her, then closed mildly through the stretch. CRY UNCLE sprinted clear onto the main track, set the pace, was
 taken back sharply when COPPER FOX went by her, was hustled late turn, then finished evenly. SUGATI stumbled leaving the gate then settled in mid
 pack, was hustled three to five-wide through the turn but never reached contention. WESTLODGE INTRIGUE raced in mid pack, closed four-wide on the
 turn but evened out in the final furlong. FAT N BITTER was bumped by COPPER FOX and passed it on to FOREST HALO initiating the domino effect,
 raced in mid pack, dropped back at the turn, was hustled two to four-wide then flattened out in the stretch.
