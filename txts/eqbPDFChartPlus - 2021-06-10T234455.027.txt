 AQUAPHOBIA settled outside in the three path, began a rally into the far turn, vied outside the leaders into the final furlong and was going away at the end.
 STAR CONTENDER stalked two wide outside the early leader, took over in early stretch but couldn't contain the winner. SUGAR BUZZ was content to lag,
 saved ground into the stretch while rallying, angled to the outside and finished fastest. HOLIDAY TOUCH wasn't far back along the inside, came out in the
 lane but lacked the needed closing. CALL FIRST was hustled to the front, remained in comment along the inside into the stretch then weakened.
 BOWMAN'S BEAST was unhurried inside, moved closer into the stretch but couldn't gain in the lane. RAGING MARKET was outrun. HIRSCHBEIN faded
 inside. WINNING SHOT stopped.
