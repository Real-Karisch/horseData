 ONE PUTT PAR pressed the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide to get to terms into the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch but was all out to hold
 GOLD FINGA safe. GOLD FINGA was never far away to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted inside the winner, rallied determinedly
 and just missed. LIFE NO PAROLE was outrun to the half, saved ground to the stretch but could not make any headway in the drive. FORCE OF TEN had
 no speed, settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then also failed to offer a late response. CALL YOUR BLUFF hustled to the front, set the
 pace to the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and tired. LITTLE MISS HOTTIE was chasing to the second turn but gave way through the stretch.

 Footnotes
 PASSION FOR PAPA was on the pace outside the runnerup, raced three wide to the stretch, rallied through the final furlong and was a game winner.
 TUESDAYS SUPERNOVA had good speed, dueled two wide to the stretch, battled the winner late but was nipped. CATS CONTESSA got outsprinted
 early, circled four wide to the stretch then finished in a rally but was too late. STICKER SHOCK chased the pace off the rail to the stretch then could not
 make an impact late. FANCY COOKIE had no speed, raced three wide into the turn then swung out five wide into the stretch but lacked a closing response.
 ALOHA SPIRIT had no speed and was never a threat. TAYLOR'S ROSE tracked the pace to the turn, came three wide to the stretch then weakened. SO
 HERES THE THING had speed to the turn then saved ground but gave way through the drive.

 Footnotes
 WARRENS LIL MARGIE was quickest, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then kicked away to mid stretch under urging and held driving. AMERICAN
 PEGASUS was outsprinted to the backstretch, pushed closer inside rivals leaving half, raced three wide to the stretch then closed steadily to get the place.
 TANNED MISTRESS tracked the pace to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch, was not a threat to the winner and got nabbed for second. KNOLL
 had no speed, settled to the turn, saved ground to the stretch and could only pick off rivals. CLARA'S DREAM was also settled to the turn, bid three then
 four wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. LOVELY LIONESS prompted the pace two wide to the stretch then got outkicked by the
 winner and weakened. PRETTY SURPRISE checked off heels on the first turn, tracked to the half then saved ground to no avail. LAST MINUTE trailed
 throughout.
