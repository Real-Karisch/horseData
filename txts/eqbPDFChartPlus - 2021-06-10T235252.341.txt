 Footnotes
 INSPEIGHTOF stalked the pacesetter from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole, drove past and was
 wrapped up late. ETHEL G was away alertly to gain the lead at once, continued on a clear advantage into the lane then could not hold the winner safe while
 keeping on and finished clearly second best. SKIP'S SONG was along the inside through the turn and into the lane, could not gain on the top ones and was
 under strong handling to gain the minor share late. SWEET ARITHMETIC was in the three path through the turn, swung into the lane from the five path, was
 under a drive through the lane and lost the show spot late. SKY DIETY raced near the rail through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and
 lacked a closing bid. SUNSET PAULA JO chased the pace from the three or four path through the turn then weakened in the drive. MARCHENWALD was
 in the four path through the turn and was never a factor.
