 Footnotes
 HARD TO BE HUMBLE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits under pressure from FORTUNE FOUND to the
 outside, tucked to the inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, edged away under a
 drive to the finish holding well to the wire. COMPLEX SYSTEM got bumped at the start by THIS ILLDEFEND who broke inwards, then got bumped solidly by
 WORLDLINK who broke outwards, chased three wide down the backstretch from just off the pace before tucking to the two path into the turn, got mildly
 shuffled as FORTUNE FOUND began to back up in front three furlongs out and took to the inside near the five-sixteenths bobbling along the rail, angled out
 five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. DEGAS brushed the off side stall at the start and came under coaxing, chased
 just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and ran on to secure the
 show honors. THIS ILL DEFEND broke in at the start bumping COMPLEX SYSTEM, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung
 four wide for home and kept on for the last major share. U S ARMY CORPS coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from three
 furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish. CENTURION three then two wide in pursuit from near the
 rear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. WITHERSPOON hustled from the gate,
 chased along the inside down the backstretch before taking to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide
 into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. WORLDLINK broke out at the start bumping COMPLEX SYSTEM solidly, chased five paths off the
 inside until tucked to the two path into the turn, came under a ride three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.
 FORTUNE FOUND pressed the pace three then two wide lightly coaxed along, got shaken off inside the three-eighths and faded through the latter portion
 of the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

 Footnotes
 PECATONICA tucked along the rail approaching the end of the homestretch, was rated along keeping an eye on the front runners, lost the pocket to ALLEY
 TO CALVARY at the three-eighths pole, patiently drafted behind that foe, saw that one inch its way back to the outside late on the second bend, got cued up
 cutting the corner into the stretch, launched a successful rail rally, wresting away the advantage in the general area of the sixteenth pole, edged away then
 dug in late to preserve the decision. HIT A PROVISIONAL had the pilot grab hold after taking an awkward initial step, got maneuvered into the two path
 once onto the main course, sat there reserve, tipped into the three path by the top of turn two, angled out six wide from upper to midlane for running room,
 straightened away and had a good finish down the center to procure the place. MORELIKELYTHANNOT stalked the pace primarily from the two path for the
 opening three-quarters, was called upon for more after the third fraction had been finalized, shifted four wide stepping into the lane, clawed its way into
 contention, failed to claim the top but stayed on well to nail down the show. AUGUSTA MOON raced three wide on the cluibhouse bend, crept up to press
 the pace once onto the backstretch, took over by the far turn, was put to a drive for the drive home, got collared with about a sixteenth go then weakened.
 ALLEY TO CALVARY within range two wide, sneaked into the pocket at the three-eighths pole, bided its time making its way to the end of the second bend,
 inched back to the outside coming up to the quarter pole, was in traffic chasing the ones to catch from the top of the lane until the sixteenth pole, flashed
 some interest when clear belatedly. MARGIE MUSIC swung safely six wide onto the main course after completing the short run on the chute leading up to it,
 went about the first turn three wide, was one path farther off the inside on the subsequent one, got moved out six wide from upper to midlne, rallied mildly.
 CRATER RIM off the inside throughout, raced three wide on the far turn tipped out into path five for entrance into the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch.
 STAR SWEPT failed to menace off a ground-saving journey. APPRECIATE rated along the inside early, went in the two path on the far turn, angled five
 wide for the drive home, had no rally. UNABRIDGED (IRE) pursued the pace two wide and gave way. POSITIVE SKEW strung out three wide on both turns,
 folded. STONEWALKER disputed the pace from the inside for six furlongs and faltered.

 Footnotes
 COMMUNICATOR coaxed from the gate, dueled six then five paths off the inside with SPICE ROAD to his direct inside while lightly coaxed along, tucked
 three wide into the turn, steadily began to shake off his main pace rival when placed to further coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three then two wide
 straightened away into upper stretch, took to the inside at the three-sixteenths and drew off to the finish. KID BOURBON five paths off the inside early on
 down the backstretch, tucked three wide at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch,
 proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best. SPICE ROAD dueled to the inside of COMMUNICATOR five then four
 wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, steadily began to be shaken off and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
 spun just off the inside for home, tired in the drive while along for the show honors. ROAD HOME four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
 seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and made no impact. HAIL MICHIGAN chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch,
 tucked four wide through the turn getting put to coaxing three furlongs out, went five wide for home and tired. CORCORAN coaxed from the gate, chased
 just off the inside until tipped four wide through the turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch, folded, and was eased through the final furlong.

 PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC was patiently ridden keeping an eye on the contested pace, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, swung into action by
 swinging out seven wide after heading into the stretch, kicked into its best and closed the gap, charged by the duelers leaving the sixteenth pole and edged
 away. MO DIDDLEY got rated along the inside while vying for control, was driven three wide into the lane, taking the nemesis along for an abbreviated ride,
 saw its stable mate go by with approximately a sixteenth remaining, won the battle for second. SUDDEN SURPRISE prompted MO DIDDLEY from path two,
 was induced by that opponent into coming a couple of paths farther off the inside into the stretch, went down the lane engaged in a spirited tussle, fell short
 of place honors. JEWEL CAN DISCO forwardly placed three wide on the turn, lacked a solid closing punch. JOE'S SMOKIN GUN stepped onto the turn
 from path three, commenced the stretch one wider, had no rally. WHAT A CATCH underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, got sent out six wide from
 upper to midlane, had no offering. CANDID DESIRE departed the backstretch from the two path, came into the lane three wide, never made its presence
 felt. O SHEA CAN U SEE the trailer during the initial stages, rode the rail from the top of the bend to the five-sixteenths marker, went into the stretch, lacked
 a rally then was protected and allowed to fade away from the eighth pole onward. SUMMER BOURBON hung out five wide on the turn, gave way. FLEET
 WARRIOR made it over to the rail on the backstretch, came to a halt as the half was being completed, was pulled up after being eased, then was vanned
 off.

 VALMONT got bumped at the start by PREFERRED OUTCOME who broke outwards and in turn brushed THREE OUTLAWS, tracked the pace under a
 rating hold from a loose pocket patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch in behind the leader, tipped to the two path a furlong from
 home, rallied to engage the top tussling briefly before taking command seventy yards from home, then dug in under late threat to hold on at the wire.
 THREE OUTLAWS brushed at the start by the aforementioned foe due to pressure from PREFERRED OUTCOME, chased just off the inside from near the
 rear until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, advanced through the latter portion of the turn and got set down spinning three to four wide into upper
 stretch, followed the winner a furlong out before tipping out a sixteenth from home offering up a good finish surging late but ultimately missed at the end.
 BROCKMONINOFF coaxed from the gate, crossed to show the way just off the inside in hand through swift splits, got roused taking the inside route into
 upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught seventy yards from home by a pair while clear for the show
 honors. COOLBOY five then four wide down the backstretch forwardly placed, tucked three wide through the turn advancing and placed to coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch offering a bid from there to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. WILD WILLIAM bobbled
 at the start recovered outwards under hustling and was bumped by ELENZEE who broke inwards, chased along the inside from mid pack under coaxing
 from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. PREFERRED OUTCOME broke out at the start
 bumping VALMONT into THREE OUTLAWS, chased along the inside from near the rear put to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled three to four wide
 into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. ELENZEE veered in at the start forcing BYDAWNSEARLYLIGHT to steady and squeezing that rival and CRACK
 SHOT back against pressure inside from WILD WILLIAM, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for
 home and offered no response. ALPHASTEST hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide in aim of the front early on, got coaxed along at the
 three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. STARRY MESSENGER chased two to three wide under coaxing from
 three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. Following a shoe repair in the paddock, JACK THE CAT chased four then three wide
 under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. CRACK SHOT got bumped and pinched between foes at the start,
 chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

 wide for home and made no impact. Please note JACK THE CAT ran for purse money only.

 MYAWAYA stalked NEW YORK SUPREME towards the three path, got roused spinning into the stretch, began the final furlong seemingly having been
 shaken off, fought onward, wore down the leader steadily in the final sixteenth and got the job done in the last jump. NEW YORK SUPREME cut over into
 the two path after establishing the top in short order, showed the way on a loosely-contested advantage, got turned loose upon striking the three-sixteenths
 marker, extended its advantage out to its mostest by the beginning of the final furlong, saw the winner chop away at it late until ultimately reeled in right at
 the end. PRINCESS COREY took up the chase from the two path, inched over to the inside route for a respite midway on the turn, angled back to the
 outside and into path three for the drive home, failed to make any headway en route for the show. BANKERS DAUGHTER underwent a four wide for most
 of the way leading up to the top of the lane, made no headway in the final furlong. SILVER BANK three wide on the turn, had no closing punch for the last
 eighth. CAZILDA FORTYTALES saved ground to the end of the bend, failed to fire appreciably after being spotted in the two path at the head of the stretch.
 BELLA INVASION raced two wide on the turn, between rivals for a good portion of that trip, was ridden into path three for entrance into the lane, made no
 impact. LUCKY LIZZIE rode the rail to the quarter pole, moved out into the two path early during the stretch drive, came up empty. CARPE AMORINA in the

 NETWORK EFFECT five wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
 poke a head in front a furlong out, dug in knocking heads to the finish with the runner up and prevailed gamely on the wire. AIRTOUCH three wide in closest
 pursuit of the leader, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, advanced to take command swinging four then three wide into upper stretch, dug in
 under threat and was headed a furlong out, fought back gamely inside but was ultimately held to the finish while well clear of the rest. DARK STORM two to
 three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors in the
 final jumps. AURELIUS MAXIMUS bumped at the start by I LOVE JAXSON who broke inwards, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under a
 ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. GIO D'ORO established the front and
 showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under light coaxing into the far turn before being asked for more with five-sixteenths to run as AIRTOUCH
 advanced outside, yielded the front spinning just off the inside for home, weakened in the stretch. ALLURED four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
 three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and weakened. I LOVE JAXSON broke in at the start bumping AURELIUS MAXIMUS, chased just off
 the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, got coaxed along with seven-sixteenths to run, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 OUR SUPER NOVA took up position two wide in midpack after the start, patiently kept watch on the front runners during the run around the bend, angled
 four wide into the stretch and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, hitched up to FAIR REGIS at the conclusion of the run through the furlong grounds,
 out-dueled that opponent during the sixteenth that followed and edged away. FAIR REGIS vied for command to the outside of CARRERA CAT, going about
 the task mostly from path two, was in hand heading that rival approaching the quarter pole, went onward a little farther and was switched over to stronger
 handling, got pounced upon by the winner soon afterwards, proved no match, weakened leaving the sixteenth marker, narrrowly salvaged the place. MY
 ROXY GIRL tracked the pace from the pocket, came under a ride by the five-sixteenths pole, spun into the stretch, ventured onward, missed out on second.
 ESPRESSO SHOT was set to a brisk hand ride along the chute to get going, tipped into the two path, got re-roused midpoint on the turn, moved out five
 wide for the drive home, mustered up a mild response to take the last major check. KID IS FROSTY along the outside throughout, was sighted pullling on
 the bit during the initial stages, pursued the pacesetter from path three on the turn, was about as wide entering the stretch, kept pace for a little longer then
 gave way. BLUEGRASS JAMBOREE remained towards the back of the pack after the field had been sent on its way, travelled two to three wide on the turn,
 was fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, lacked the necessary response. CARRERA CAT off alertly, retained the
 advantage, cut over to the rail, showed the way, pressed by the top one from the outside, got displaced by that foe approaching the quarter pole, remained
 prominently placed for a little while longer before faltering. PURRAGEOUS DYNA saved ground until the end of the bend, tipped into path three stepping
 onto the top of the lane, had no offering.

 under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied getting herded a bit out by MISS J MCKAY nearing the eighth pole,
 offered up a good finish to collar that rival a sixteenth from home, then dug in gamely to prevail on the wire. MISS J MCKAY broke in at the start bumping A
 FREUD OF MAMA in concert with the aforementioned foe, came under hustling briefly after the start and chased three then four wide coming under coaxing
 at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied shying out under a near sided stick before being corrected near the eighth pole, took brief
 command inside that station before being headed a sixteenth from home, battled on inside but was ultimately bested at the end while clear for the place
 honors. KARAK coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide from just off the pace placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung four to five wide
 into upper stretch, rallied to get on near even terms a furlong out, took brief command inside that station before being overtaken by the top pair, flattened out
 in the late stages while safe for the show honors. ENOLA GAY settled just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, got coaxed along three furlongs from
 home, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LUCREZIA coaxed from the gate, raced four wide in closest aim of the leader
 down the backstretch before tucking three then two wide into the turn, advanced through that bend on the leader under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
 took over the front spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a trio and was displaced a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages.
 A FREUD OF MAMA got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way and conceded three lengths to the front, chased four wide under
 coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. VIOLENT POINT two to three wide in pursuit down the
 backstretch, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. BAYERLY

 pole, yielded the front just before spinning from the two path into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 BRAY got set up along the inside route well before arriving at the end of the homestretch, was patiently ridden keeping track of the front runners from
 midpack for the opening three-quarters, picked up interest springing from the five-sixteenths marker, slipped to the outside and into path two by the start of
 the drive home, narrowed in, altered course into path five in midlane, kicked into his best with about a sixteenth remaining, wrested away the advantge with
 three jumps or so to spare and edged away. BOLD GEM attained a forward positon, prompted LOADED JOE from the two path two, stepped into the stretch
 then challenged in earnest coming up to the three-sixteenths marker, fought its way by a stubborn opponent to grab a narrow lead, relinquished to the
 winner late but managed to save second. MONKEYSEEMONKEYDO took up positon in the pocket in short order, was rated along for the opening six
 furlongs keeping an eye on the front runners, got cued up angling to the outside from the five-sixteenths pole, completed the maneuver towards path three
 by the head of the stretch, finished with willingness to secure the show. LOADED JOE grabbed the advantage shortly after the start, cut over to the inside,
 showed the way, rated and with the second place finisher in attendance from the outside, ventured onward under the same set up all the way to the quarter
 pole, was called upon for more heading home, went at it in a fierce tussle from that juncture with BOLD GEM before weakening in the last sixteenth. SANDY
 LANE KITTEN in range two to three wide, lacked a solid closing punch. HURRICANE ANDREW remained along the inside route after the start, was in
 midpack in pursuit of the pace, cut the corner into the stretch, made no headway. LOOKIN AT ROSES settled into the two path after making contact with left
 side of the starting gate, underwent a two wide journey for most of the way to the quarter pole, got sent out five wide for the drive, came up empty. PALLAS
 ATHENE off the inside, travelled three wide on the far turn, came under a ride as three-quarters was being reeled off, angled about six wide into the lane,
 made no impact. ROLLER ROLLS ON took the inside route, was asked for some run on the second bend, tipped out towards path two at the head of the
 stretch, had no offering. NOBLE NEBRASKAN guided over to the rail after stumbling badly at the start, was on hold waiting briefly behind the winner coming
 up to the quarter pole, settled in upper stretch and was put to a drive, failed to fire appreciably. FOTI two wide on each end, failed to menace. SEEDISKID
 near the inside until the quarter pole, was never in it.
