 Footnotes
 SICILIA CONNIE bobbled at the start, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, gained a
 short lead, then drew off and was kept to the task. SARATOGA BY DESIGN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the lane, then
 stayed on when challenged into the stretch, could not threaten the winner and held the place. KATERI EMPIRE well placed, moved up while angling out
 through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. OFFLEE IRISH mid pack, saved ground through the second turn,
 came through inside of rivals into the stretch and held a share. CARIBBEAN GIRL showed little. FLORIA TOSCA was never involved.
