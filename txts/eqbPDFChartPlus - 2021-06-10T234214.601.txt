 into the four path in the turn, loomed large down the lane while making a bid but flattened out late in the drive. PERFECT PARADISE set the pace early,
 was on the inside into the lane and faltered in the stretch run. STINA pressed the pace early, inched ahead nearing the lane while off the rail and gave way

 stages. TIZAGHERA was back early on, shifted into the four path in the turn, came out down the lane and bothered a foe, was up for place in the final
 stages while no match for the winner. CAMPAIGN SPY was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, shifted into the three path in the turn and moved up
 in the stretch run. GRAND ROYALE broke slowly from the gate and raced back early on, shifted into the three path in the turn and improved position in the
 stretch drive. NEWCOMER stalked the pace early, shifted into the four path in the turn and faded down the lane. GRAYSSHOOTINGSTAR chased the pace
 early, shifted into the three path in the turn and was empty in the stretch run. CLIPBOARD MONEY set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and
 gave way in the stretch. RELEASED broke slowly and was done early. AGENT BOND veered out at the start and was bothered in the stretch run.
