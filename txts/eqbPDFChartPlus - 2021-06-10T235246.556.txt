 Footnotes
 WATSON set a well reserved pace inside, was asked midway on the far turn but finished mostly of his own initiative. OUR CHARITABLE raced off the pace
 inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then dueled through the stretch for second. SAMADI BLUE settled off the
 early pace off the rail, drifted into the second turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the
 four path then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. STOCK BROKER settled off the early pace about the three path and was carried out into the
 second turn, entered the backstretch toward the outside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little more.
 STROLLANOTHERTIME settled off the pace off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole then faded approaching the far turn. ROCKAROUND raced well
 off the pace inside.

 Footnotes
 MOONLIT NIGHT stalked the pace from the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took over three wide just past the quarter, raced clear mid
 turn then dug in under determined stretch handling to hold off PROVIDENCE R V F who, settled close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
 the far turn off the rail, angled four wide entering the stretch, dueled to striking position mid-stretch but was outfinished the final sixteenth. THORN OF ROSE
 HILL settled back toward the inside and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path
 and passed some rivals down the lane. SUAVE JUAN was shut off at the start then saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the half mile pole, raced off the
 rail on the far turn and showed little more. BLACK STEEL broke through the gate prior the start then veered out leaving the gate, raced with the pace two
 deep, challenged into the backstretch, raced at even terms to the quarter pole, remained a close factor through the far turn then weakened. PREACHER
 GRAND was not a factor. ORIOLES MAGIC rated a slim lead inside, dug in to the challenge of Black Steel through the backstretch, was headed past the
 quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened. Due to an equipment malfunction, this race was hand timed.

 HIGH FIBER took the lead three wide at the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear toward the quarter and held well under steady handling. FIBERTOWN raced
 well off the early pace saving ground, bid into the turn, steadily improved in the three path and dug in to take second the final yards. MAJESTIC SEAS
 engaged in close early chase inside but dropped back toward the quarter pole and was outfinished for second the final yards. SAGEBRUSH became
 fractious in the gate and unseated his rider, picked up the chase toward the inside leaving the chute, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little more.
 NAZCA MYSTERY chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn in the three path and proved empty down the lane. FROSTY'S MAJESTY was hustled
 along with a brief early lead then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, drifted a bit toward the head of the lane then flattened stride.
