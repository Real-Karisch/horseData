 early, raced evenly on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. CLASSY VISION was off the pace, closed the gap on the
 far turn and from the five path through the stretch was up for show. DIAMOND BREW stalked the leader from the inside but lost ground on the far turn and
 had no impact. COURT TIME tracked the early leaders and was a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was empty.

 turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. PRINCESSA FIONA broke poorly and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 SENT FROM HEAVEN was hustled early, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. STREET CAT SAM
 tracked the leaders from the outside and was roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. PRIMARY
 SURPLUS was in range and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. CRIME WAVE was off slow, had a mild
 gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. POINTMAN was in touch and saved ground on the turn but was no real
 threat. UNCLE LOU broke poorly and had a mild gain on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch was all out. TRAVOLTA was off the pace,
 trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. ALERT KITTEN forced the pace and was a factor on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.
