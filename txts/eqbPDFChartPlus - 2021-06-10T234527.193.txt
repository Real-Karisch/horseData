 JILL MADDEN sped to the early lead, set all the pace along the inside, kicked away on the second turn and drew off under a couple left handed cracks of
 the whip and a long hold late. ZANAB three deep into the first turn, stalked off the rail or outside a rival, went between horses on the second turn and three
 wide into the stretch and held the place. HONOR MAKER broke out a bit, pulled and steadied into the first turn, tugged his way along off the rail into the
 backstretch to chase the pace, angled in entering the stretch, lacked room off heels in midstretch, came out a bit past the eighth pole and split horses late
 for third. SASSY ASHLEY close up stalking the winner a bit off the rail, continued between foes leaving the second turn and through the stretch and was
 edged for the show. PATTIN FOR A DANCE bobbled at the start, angled in leaving the first turn and chased inside, continued along the rail on the second

 Footnotes
 MADELYN'S WILD MAX stalked between foes then inside on the turn, came out past the eighth pole, bid under urging to gain the lead a sixteenth out and
 won clear. STONEYS MR CRUISER had good early speed and dueled inside, inched away in the stretch, could not hold off the winner but was clearly
 second best. GOLDEN ATLANTIC dueled outside the runner-up, stalked outside the winner in midstretch and held third. BRAVE JULIAN saved ground
 chasing the pace, steadied in tight into the turn, continued along the rail in the stretch and lacked the needed late kick but shared fourth. NAGYS PIGGY
 BANK stalked outside a rival then three deep on the turn and into the stretch and weakened. HAWK'S EYES (BRZ) settled outside then off the rail, came
 four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. ROYAL F J steadied in tight just after the start, settled off the rail then outside a rival on the turn and
 three wide into the stretch and did not rally. CUPID'S BEAU stalked outside then four wide on the turn and into the stretch and weakened. WARREN'S
 COLE settled off the rail then a bit off the fence on the turn and was not a threat. AJAC stalked off the rail then between horses into the turn, dropped back a
 bit off the fence leaving the turn and weakened.
