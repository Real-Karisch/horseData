 YAKOV stalked the pace on the outside going three and four wide around the turn then uncorked a long rally down the stretch. GREY GATOR got pinched
 back at the start but went up and stalked the pace, stayed on the inside the whole way, angled out at the three sixteenths pole looking for running room but
 did not have enough. BLOW THE WHISTLE stalked the pace between horses going around the turns in the two or three paths, finished with a good effort.
 JACK O LIAM vied for the lead on the outside going two and three wide around the turns, took control of the lead at the three eighths pole and held it into
 the stretch but gave way at the three sixteenths pole. RARE ART had a clear lead as the field rounded the first turn, dug in when he was collared at the
 three quarters pole and stayed towards the front into the stretch but was no match. DEACON FURR bumped at the start with GREY GATOR then trailed the
 field, went two wide turning for home and was able to pass a tired rival. POPSRACER bumped with GREY GATOR at the start but shook it off and went up
 to the front, vied for the lead while going two wide around the turns but was through at the half mile pole.

 SPOTTY ZEALOUS set a pressured pace while on the inside, edged clear at the three eighths pole and was ridden out from there. MUCHACHO DUDE
 chased the pace while going three wide around the turn, rallied when asked for more but it was not enough. IGNOTUS was quick into stride but settled to
 stalk the pace, went two wide around the turn, ran all out through the stretch but it was not enough. ENCRYPT had a sluggish start then ran towards the
 rear and had no rally. WE WILBURN YOU tracked the pace between horses going two wide around the turn then lacked a rally. BIG PLATINUM tracked the
 pace going three wide then had no response. TRANSCENDENT was reluctant to load but broke well, went three wide around the turn but was no factor.
