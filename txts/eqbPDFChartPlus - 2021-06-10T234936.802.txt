 weakened off top trio in the lane. GRAN KING OF KINGS saved ground throughout without gaining threatening position. PEACE ACCORD was off step
 slow at the start, hustled up along outside going through turn but failed to gain close contention. SALINGER raced off pace then along outside entering lane,

 TIPSY KITTEN was taken in hand at the start, secured rail position in first turn, settled nicely while rated in early stages, picked up pace between rivals in far
 turn, guided up and by three wide upper stretch, pulled away while ridden out, shown whip, never used and finished going away. MAI TY ONE ON was
 taken under snug hold in opening stages, continued unhurried near the back along outside, patiently widen in far turn, cut corner gaining ground entering
 lane, well ridden, split foes in late drive and dug in for place. WITHOUT REMORSE bumped bit between rivals at the start, continued rated off pace, slightly
 steady approaching three eighths pole, set down driving three to four wide in the lane, yielded late and just missed runner up spot. SMART RETURN
 hopped at the start then continued in or near the back, remained unasked then set down driving outside in the lane, gained late racing wide but too late for
 serious impact. BOLD ANIMAUX was briefly fractious in the gate, stalked up close then waited for racing room at the quarter pole, put to drive then flattened
 in lane. MANOLETE raced near the back then passed tiring rivals in the lane. MATANZAS INLET pressed early pace, dueled along outside into upper
 stretch, no match for eventual winner then gaveway in final furlong. ROYALSTON was unhurried through backstretch, saved ground hustled up just off
 inside, failed to move. VISION OF BLUE set pressured pace then dueled for lead, continued to battle along rail into upper stretch then had nothing left in
 late reserve. HE'S THE ONE raced in range along outside, came out six wide entering lane, failed to move on. JUST FOOLIN AROUND pulled up after first
 turn then vanned of after race.
