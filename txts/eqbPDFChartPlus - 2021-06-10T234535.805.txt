 Footnotes
 BIG COULEE was away in good order to set a clear pace, widened into the stretch and drew away to score as the rider pleased. YOUNGS MILL chased
 BIG COULEE to no avail, but stayed on well to prove best of the rest. CLIFF'S NOTES was unhurried into stride, circled into the stretch six wide and was
 along in time to earn the show. SACRED PROMISE was allowed to settle, came five wide but lacked a response when called upon. AGGRO CRAG (IRE)
 contended four wide through the turn and faltered. WAR VENTURE failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 MYSTIC TIGER was away alertly to set the pace, shook clear on the second turn, was kept to task and held safely. ARCHIBOLDO settled in hand along the
 inside, got through to make his bid but was unable to reach the winner. RAKEITIN was allowed to settle, split horses and finished willingly to earn the show.
 RABANITO stalked the pace four wide, offered a mild bid leaving the second turn, but failed to sustain the drive. DR. PHILAN went wide and was never a
 factor. FIGHTMASTER was in tight and steadied early, was close up three wide, but stopped after five furlongs.

 GTMEOUTAHERESEAMUS settled in hand, wheeled out to launch his bid on the second turn, dug in and wore down ARBORETUM in the final strides.
 ARBORETUM attended the pace along the inside, got through to make his bid, forged a narrow lead a furlong out, fought on but was unable to resist the
 winner. MAGNETIC START opened clear to set the pace, was collared between horses entering the stretch and grudgingly gave in. OWL CREEK
 contended four wide, but weakened between rivals and faded. NO TIME TO KID (IRE) was unhurried into stride, got through and improved position.
 HURRICANE BAY contended five wide, but came up empty between horses on the second turn and dropped out. CHARLIE ST GOLD broke slow and was
 never a factor.

 TIZMATIZED tracked four wide, took over midway through the turn, opened clear and maintained a safe advantage. TIZ SARDONIC JOE was allowed to
 settle, ranged into striking distance five wide, continued on well but was unable to bridge the gap. AYE SKIPPER attended the pace along the inside, got
 through but lacked the needed late response. INDY RHYTHM was allowed to settle, finished with a belated gain but failed to seriously threaten. SERGIOS
 PRIDE contended three wide, but weakened between horses entering the stretch and faded. ROTTAKEN broke awkwardly, lagged well back and passed
 only the tiring ones. TACOMA PARK showed little. HIGH MYSTERY was away alertly, set the pace off of the inside, was headed before going a half and
 stopped.

 OROPA stalked the pace four wide, launched a bold bid leaving the turn, struck the front a furlong out and kicked clear. COLOR ME BLUSH was allowed to
 settle, rallied between horses and was up in time to earn the place. GALE'S LOVE vied for the lead between horses, was jostled nearing the five furlong
 marker, settled off of the leaders, shifted out and moved up three wide, forged command midway through the turn, was collared entering the stretch and
 wilted in the drive. PIPPA DIA was allowed to settle, finished with a mild rally and improved position. BOARDING CARD was allowed to settle, came four
 wide but lacked a response when called upon. HANG ON ANNIE was away alertly, contested the pace three wide, came in and bumped GALE'S LOVE
 early, disputed the issue to the stretch and caved. DONNA'S HOLIDAY dueled along the inside, stopped before going a half, was eased to the wire but
 walked off.
