 DEEP CANYON stalked the pace four wide, bid into the stretch, pulled clear and just lasted while weakening late. MISS RAGE chased outside off the
 leaders, advanced wide then made a gradual gain. YES IT'S DYNA urged close up inside then began faltering on the turn. LOYAL AFICIONADA lacked
 speed then passed rivals late without menacing. LILY AIN'T FOOLIN hustled to a narrow lead outside early, vied through the turn and gave way.
 UNSHACKLED dueled between rivals then inside to the stretch and stopped. FORGIVEN MELODY dropped back early and was always outrun. CAROLE'S
 RAINBOW steadied along behind rivals down the backstretch and faded.

 Footnotes
 ASPEN XTREME stumbled leaving the gate then came out bumped Peter G. Fox, raced between foes, eased out and split rivals in early stretch and
 finished strongly to win going away. MISSION OBERON, unhurried early, raced and rallied wide and was along for place. WISE JUDE, very wide early,
 moved closer to the rail on the turn, quickly opened a clear lead mid stretch but then weakened late. SHANGHAI CHECK, who's rider didn't carry a whip,
 saved ground, was in tight quarters near the three eighths pole, split rivals into stretch and then moved back to the rail and failed to menace. FROST'S
 SONG drifted to the five path setting pace, moved to the rail on the turn while clear then faltered through the stretch. PELLAGRINO, with a wide trip, was no
 factor. KNOWN BUT TO GOD, fanned out to the six path on backstretch, chased then tired. PETER G. FOX, bumped leaving the gate then failed to
 threaten. SAMS LAST GHASP, unruly prestart, raced in the four path, came in put SHANGHAI CHECK in tight on the far turn then tired. PAWN IT BACK
 came out leaving the gate, saved ground and tired badly.

 Footnotes
 GIRL POWDER lacked speed four wide, bid into the stretch, split rivals and just got up in time. CARRY YOUR HEELS pursued the loose pacesetter, took
 over into the stretch, bid clear but was nailed nearing the wire. ROVE dropped back early, advanced between rivals on the turn and closed well. PATTY
 MAC'S GIRL raced far behind, moved extremely wide on the turn and into the stretch. RED WAGON trailed the opening quarter then showed some late
 energy. EDFITZATMAHLE'SBAR saved ground off the pace and lacked a solid rally. LUCKY MEETING faded on the turn then passed rivals late. STAR
 STUDDED prompted the pace three wide to the turn then gave way. QUEEN FANTABULOUS forced the leaders four wide and stopped midway on the turn.
 LUCKY STASH sprinted clear inside to the quarter pole then gave way readily.

 and bumped winner leaving the gate, raced in four path of second flight, bid near stretch then flattened out. PARTNER'S POWER, fractious in the gate, was
 in the four path, drifted wider and gave way. FORT APACHE, wide, dropped back steadily. VIDARR, very wide, failed to menace. MAD SWEENEY, off
 slowest, was hustled up to stalk inside then stopped.

 Footnotes
 SIGHT LINE drifted out entering first turn, set the pace in five path, was clear on final turn, opened a long lead mid stretch and was clear under strong
 handling. MIDNIGHT HARBOR saved ground while moving, swung wide into stretch and closed too late. THE MORNING GUYS, wide and never far back,
 was between foes in stretch had had no rally. WILD ABOUT DEB, well placed between foes, tired and finished in a dead heat with RAPO. RAPO was wide
 chasing the winner, tired and finished on even terms with WILD ABOUT DEB. TERRY'S CHARM broke slowly, raced very wide and was no factor. TO THE
 VICTOR passed tiring foes. IN EQUALITY failed to menace. GOTTA GET AWAY, three wide in second flight, tired. JACK O LIAM saved ground just off the
 pace then stopped. VEGAS STRIP, between second flight, had nothing left. NOBLE KENT never threatened.

 Footnotes
 LOVE IS YOUR NAME settled outside, moved boldly six wide on the turn, collared the leader and edged away late. I'M A FACTUM trailed early, advanced
 wide, rallied extremely wide into the stretch and was up for the place. SOUTH SEA broke alertly and set them pace off the inside, led to the final eighth and
 continued gamely. JEFAZO made a menacing bid very wide on the turn then flattened out late. BOYD CROWDER chased three wide off the pace and
 lacked a solid rally. HATTERAS BOUND dueled between rivals for half a mile then weakened. BLU WITHOUT YOU roughed just after the start, dropped
 back and was never a factor. CANIFORM saved ground close up and faltered. POPIZAR raced near the inside off the pace and was never in contention. A
 J'S WAY hustled just off the leaders and stopped abruptly. MATTER OF FACTOR prompted the pace three wide for three furlongs and gave way.
