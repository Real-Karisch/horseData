 Footnotes
 SILENT VISION was hustled early, had a slim lead on the turn, vied through the stretch and was kept to task. WINDANCE was in touch, a factor from the
 three path on the turn and had a bid from the four path through the stretch but just missed. MOUSQUETAIRE was in range and raced evenly on the turn but
 needed more. PICK ON ME was away alertly and forced the pace on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. EXILE TRAIN
 showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. TIGNE was unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and was never a threat. A
 CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDERS ON MOUSQUETAIRE AND WINDANCE AGAINST SILENT VISION FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE
 STRETCH WERE NOT ALLOWED. PER RULING #TB HRAP 0603302017 FROM THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISSION, APPEAL HAS BEEN

 but needed more. PERFECT ELLA was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. SNIPPETS OF TIME was off
 slow and had a mild gain on the turn but was not a factor. RING FOR MADDIE was in range early but chased on the turn and was empty.
