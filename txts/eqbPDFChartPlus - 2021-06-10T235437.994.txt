 Footnotes
 WILANNAMOON bumped at the start, sped to the front, continued clear in the two path to the stretch, received a challenge from the inside and held gamely
 under a drive. MY EBONY STAR broke in and bumped at the start, traveled off the rail, moved over to the inside, bid inside the leader in the stretch but
 lacked the needed late kick. ROYAL RED off slow and almost unseated the rider at the start, advanced three wide around the turn, rallied late and earned
 the show. CODE ALERT chased the speed while outside a rival, three wide on the turn and weakened in the late stages. JUST A GEM failed to show early
 speed, traveled four wide around the turn and never responded to urging. PALM CANYON settled along the inside to the turn, angled out into the two path
 and never rallied. ALLAN'S BABY knocked into rival leaving the gate, angled in and raced a bit off the rail through the turn and weakened in the stretch.

 FREAKY FLOYD chased off the rail early, bid three deep on the turn, floated out by OUR MASERATI, rallied from the outside and outkicked KETTLE MAN
 for the score. KETTLE MAN stumbled a bit leaving the gate, stalked the pace wide up the backstretch, angled in nearing the turn, traveled in the two path to
 the lane, challenged in the upper-stretch and gained command near the sixteenth pole but was outfinished in the final strides. OUR MASERATI dueled from
 the outside, lugged out around the turn and weakened in the stretch. RELENTLESS WARRIOR chased outside a rival, bid four deep into the turn, carried
 wide through the bend, lost ground in the lane and shifted out around a rival past the sixteenth pole. CONUNDRUM PASS dueled from the inside into and
 around the turn but tired in the lane.

 Footnotes
 HIT N STREAK bumped start, drifted in. CARTEL BAD BOY flew late, just missed. SUMMERTIMES DOLL drifted in, out early. ONCE MORE no rally.
 SHINING FAVORITE broke in, bumped start. CARTELS SWEETIE weakened, outside. LIZZYS FAVORITE bothered, steadied briefly early. The trainer of
 SUMMERTIMES DOLL lobbed an objection against the winnner, HIT N STREAK. After a review the Stewards ruled that SUMMERTIMES DOLL was drifting
 out and HIT N STREAK was clear during the incident and there would be no change in the order of finish.
