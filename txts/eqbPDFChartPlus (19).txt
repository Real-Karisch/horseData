 dueled in the turn and took on added outside challenge of eventual winner, could not move on for lead then gaveway in final furlong. COTTON TOOYAH

 SOUPER CATCH raced under snug hold racing behind leader coming out of the chute, continued to stalk three to four wide going through the backstretch,
 came under hand ride and moved up to take narrow lead at quarter pole then put to drive and pulled away from rest of field. RUPP bobbled slightly at the
 start then continued under snug hold to race off the early pace, settled along inside then sent driving two wide top stretch, came out couple more paths, was
 no match for winner, dug in and got up for place in final strides. CHARLIE THE GREEK settled nicely while being rated off two leaders, took closer order
 then hustled up along rail racing near lead at quarter pole, appeared tired top stretch but continued game bid trying to hold runner up spot, lost position in
 final strides, cleared the rest. NICHE cleared lead and angled in out of the chute, continued on top under snug hold wanting to do more in early stages,
 widened advantage on top then challenged in the turn, lost top spot near quarter pole then faded in the lane. MANOLETE raced off the pace then hustled up
 in turn, continued outside bid in the lane but lacked needed rally for late impact. MR. PINOCCHIO showed early response then retreated.

 Footnotes
 SOGLIO raced two wide in first turn and continued under slight restraint in early stages to settled off early pace, picked up pace leaving backstretch, split
 foes gamely past the quarter pole still unasked, roused forward and dueled along outside of SIEM RIEP, rival fought back gamely, raced noses apart then
 put a head in front and held firm in end. SIEM RIEP got pushed and bumped after start, steadied, recovered quickly and was bit keen racing under snug
 hole, took lead along rail when rival bore out at quarter pole, dueled along inside of SOGLIO, fought back gamely then lacked needed kick to get by late.
 REPEAT REPEAT was step slow at the start, hustled up and angled closer to inside from outside position to save ground in first turn, settled nicely while
 rated through the backstretch, took closer order racing three wide in far turn, raced within striking distance then lost ground off top pair, dug in gamely to
 regain and hold share. BOYD CROWDER raced off the pace then hustled up in far turn, got carried our wide racing along outside of RACINGS MY GAME,
 got by rival then angled closer inside, gained then yielded and lost show. MILES OF HUMOR raced mippack then roused forward along rail, continued in
 contention while under drive then finished evenly. SILVER DEFENSE got bumped between and squeezed back shortly after the start, continued in the back
 along rail, showed response and altered course in final furlong, finished with interest. GRAY DUDE got bumped back and forth just after the start, continued
 near the back then produced good kick racing three to four wide upper stretch but failed to sustain bid in final sixteenth. PORTER STREET raced off the
 pace and saved ground through the backstretch and into head of lane, angled out, put to drive, lacked needed rally. RACINGS MY GAME drifted in causing
 chain reaction just after the start, cleared the lead on top then bore out in far turn and dropped back. STORMING MY WAY stalked through the backstretch
 then hustled up in the far turn, came up empty at the quarter pole. NFUSION got bumped after the start and failed to respond.
