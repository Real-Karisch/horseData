 Footnotes
 RUSHIN NELL rated in the second flight, took the rail into the turn, swung out three wide to commence his bid nearing the quarter pole, responded to hand
 urging to vie for the lead midstretch, took the advantage when put to a drive inside the last furlong then put a little daylight between him and FREE MUSIC
 with seventy yards to go. FREE MUSIC vied for the lead outside from the beginning, was two wide through the bend, had the advantage into the stretch but
 slowly yielded inside the last eighth. BRADY JOE was hustled along to dispute the pace inside FREE MUSIC, had the rail through the turn and also
 gradually yielded the final furlong. HOME BOY BROWN broke inward, chased from inside, came into contention upper stretch, could not sustain his bid in
 the late going but was altered out for a clear path as he closed the gap on the weakening BRADY JOE with seventy yards left. MINUETO (MEX) was a
 contender from outside, fanned four wide leaving the bend and began to tire. WILD N' WILD void of speed, though urged along, stayed off the inside
 throughout and had no late bid.

 Footnotes
 EURAROOKIE showed first, gradually angled in as she vied for the lead outside ONE HOTDISH, moved clear when asked on the turn, took the rail into the
 stretch then continued to open up under mostly hand urging. ONE HOTDISH gradually angled in as she disputed the pace, did not stay with EURAROOKIE
 on the bend, came off the rail some for the stretch run, was no match for the latter but stayed clear for the place. TIYA advanced from inside on the bend,
 angled out three wide at the top of the lane, gained third upper stretch and slowly drifted out as she pulled away for the show. DIAMOND LEGACY was an
 early factor between rivals, improved position three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive and gradually yielded as she slowly angled out to keep a
 clear path outside TIYA. SHAKER BAKER was a step slow at the break, chased from just off the inside, angled out through the turn, came widest into the
 stretch, angled in some for a clear path inside the furlong marker and improved position without threatening. CHEEKY VIMTO full of early speed, was
 steadied or checked repeatedly for more than a furlong to keep off the early leaders' heels on the backstretch, gained a clear path near the half mile marker
 but faded between rivals on the bend. LADY LEOLA broke outward, chased from outside, angled in to be just off the inside on the turn then steadily gave
 way.

 HYPER DRIVE bumped at the break, was rated from between rivals, swung out four wide to commence his bid into the second bend, fought outside
 CHARLIE WEBB through the lane, took the advantage inside the last eighth and shook off the latter under steady urging with seventy yards left. CHARLIE
 WEBB moved up beside WHISKEY BIZ on the backstretch to share the lead, had a narrow advantage into the lane and slowly wore down inside the final
 eighth. YEOWZER bobbled a bit outward to bump HYPER DRIVE at the start, raced in contention from inside, was roused after a half mile, angled out to
 path four for racing room at the top of the stretch then could only draw away for third inside the final furlong. WHISKEY BIZ showed first, was challenged
 from outside on the backstretch and flattened out for the drive. K KASH progressed from outside to contest the pace on the backstretch, was three wide on
 the second bend, began to wear down leaving that turn, swung out widest into the lane and continued to fade.

 BAY'S COMMANDER broke alertly, soon shared the lead while in hand from outside, moved clear from two wide when let out leaving the bend and steadily
 drew off in the stretch under mostly hand urging. BUD'S MR. B was sent to contest the pace between rivals, gained the rail into the turn, did not stay with
 BAY'S COMMANDER leaving the bend, came off the rail some for the stretch run and could only shake off VISCOSITY for the place late. VISCOSITY
 prominent between rivals, moved to the outside nearing the turn, advanced three wide, challenged BUD'S MR. B for third briefly midstretch, leveled off but
 was clearly best of the rest. PINNACLE PEAK soon trailed, angled out some through the bend and passed between tired ones in the stretch. TIZ BRONCO
 BILLY displayed early speed from inside, began to tire as he neared the end of three furlongs, angled out on the bend, moved out widest at the top of the
 stretch and continued to fade. DEPUTY'SGOINGWILD was an early factor from outside but began to tire just off the inside on the turn.

 L. A. FREEWAY easily overcame a hesitation at the break to soon share the lead off the rail but inside foes, was roused leaving the turn, floated out further
 into the stretch, moved clear under a drive nearing the last furlong and held off BOLITAR under steady handling. BOLITAR was kept close from outside, lost
 ground through the bend, came into the lane from path five, brushed with TALKE OF BEAUCETTE as he took over second at the sixteenth marker and was
 closing the gap on the weakening L. A. FREEWAY late. FLYING MR K. rated off the early pace, improved position widest on the bend, lost further ground
 staying outside BOLITAR into the stretch, rallied belatedly the final furlong but swept past TALKE OF BEAUCETTE to gain third in the waning yards. TALE
 OF BEAUCETTE displayed early speed between horses, came into the lane, began to wear down, brushed with BOLITAR with a sixteenth left, was
 steadied briefly and outfinished for third. TAKEN FOR A RIDE pressed from between rivals, was steadied when his path narrowed at the end of the first
 quarter mile, altered in and began to fade along the rail on the turn.

 Footnotes
 MY QUEEN BEE was hustled up to vie for the early lead from inside, roused again on the bend, edged ahead upper stretch, driven clear inside the last
 furlong, kept to urging until just inside the sixteenth marker and maintained full control. PRETTY BRITCHES lost her rider and ran loose before loading into
 the gate, was retrieved, contested the pace from between horses once the race began, was two wide on the turn, gradually wore down for the drive but was
 unchallenged for second. SHELIKSTINYBUBBLES was an early factor just off the inside, gradually progressed through the bend and upper stretch to gain
 third with a furlong to go, leveled off in the waning yards, was angled out nearing the wire and could only hold onto the show. RIVER DEPUTY prominent
 from inside, lacked a significant stretch bid but was getting to the yielding SHELIKSTINYBUBBLES approaching the wire. DE MELO hesitated at the start,
 gradually angled out to advance through the bend, came into the lane from path three, altered out for a better path upper stretch and was also closing in for
 third late. DIBSONTHEMONEY pressed from between horses, took the turn three wide, failed to have a serious stretch bid and was steadied in the final
 strides when her path was taken. LIL FOOTNOTES chased from between rivals, stayed in path three through the bend and had no late bid. NATALIE'S
 TOCCET was away slowly and failed to menace in a wide trip. COWGIRL RUBY pressed from outside but began to yield four wide leaving the bend.
 BASICALLY BAY was checked briefly shortly after the break, soon far back, saved ground taking the turn and was empty for the drive.

 Footnotes
 DEEP IN A DREAM was kept close from inside, roused when his path along the rail remained opened at the top of the lane, edged ahead upper stretch then
 drew away under a stern drive inside the last furlong. DUKE OF KENT was quickly clear, showed the way just off the inside, roused leaving the turn,
 challenged from inside upper stretch, no match for DEEP IN A DREAM through the late going but was unchallenged for the place. MY BROTHER DON
 hustled along from outside, lost ground five wide on the turn, had the chance to angle in some into the stretch, still had a striking position with a furlong to go
 but could only pull away for third late. MEDIA KID stumbled at the break, quickly recovered to dispute the pace from between foes but began to wear down
 three wide leaving the turn. SQUARE BALE soon dropped back and failed to menace in a wide trip. UPFORWHATEVER was prominent toward the outside
 but began to wear down four wide leaving the turn. HE GOTTA GO was away slowly, moved up quickly to help prompt the pace from between rivals but
 faded two wide on the bend.

 NATALIE'S MISCHIEF well placed inside, was roused leaving the turn, came off the rail some inside the last furlong, was all out and caught KISS MY
 BLING nearing the wire. KISS MY BLING showed first and was hustled to a clear lead and the inside, roused again leaving the turn, floated out some
 entering the lane, moved back in midstretch, was under a steady drive but outfinished in a game effort. DREAMERS VISION pressed from between rivals,
 was two wide on the bend, brushed with SOCKS as she floated out some entering the stretch and made up minor ground on the top pair in the late going.
 SOCKS raced in the second flight outside DREAMERS VISION, was forced out some into the stretch and lacked the extra needed. TACTICAL SCOUT was
 steadied several times while boxed in behind traffic on the backstretch, altered out nearing the turn, lost ground widest into the lane and had no late bid.
 READTHEQUEENSNOTES soon trailed, angled in entering the turn and was empty for the drive.

 Footnotes
 EURIPIDES advanced from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up into the second bend, angled to the outside midway on that turn, came five wide into
 the lane, was all out, engaged STATE OF CHARM with a sixteenth to go and edged ahead of the latter in the waning yards. STATE OF CHARM broke a bit
 outward to bump HEIR TO DREAM, progressed three wide on the backstretch to threaten outside ICON'S SONG on the second bend, fanned out some for
 the stretch run, edged ahead, could not move clear from between rivals and was outfinished in a game try. OKIE SPATS without early speed between
 horses, picked up his pace just off the inside into the second turn, also moved to the outside midway on that bend, lost ground fanning widest into the lane,
 closed well, was too late but caught ICON'S SONG for third. ICON'S SONG was hustled up from outside early to contest the pace outside UNCLE MO
 MONEY, floated out some into the lane and slowly wore down deep stretch. UNCLE MO MONEY vied for the lead inside from the early going and also
 slowly yielded inside the last eighth. STORMFIGHTER GOLD broke alertly but was soon helping to prompt the pace from between horses, was just off the
 inside on the second turn, floated out some for the stretch run and lacked the extra needed. KENNEDY MOON prominent from just off or along the rail,
 weakened the last quarter mile. HEIR TO DREAM bumped at the break, was checked when his path was taken into the first bend, chased from between
 rivals and had little left the last three furlongs. C P LUCKY CLOVER soon trailed, chased from paths two or three and showed little. INSTUDE forced to keep
 five wide on the first turn, steadily faded running widest before finishing a half mile.
