 LOVE MY COTTON vied inside for command, edged away from BODHI DOG on the far turn, dug in gamely when headed by OURS AGAIN in upper stretch
 and battled back late on the inside to prevail. OURS AGAIN raced off the pace inside, bid three wide on the far turn, rallied outside, put a head in front of
 LOVE MY COTTON, dueled with the rival through the final sixteenth and was outfinished. GODS GREATNESS was well placed inside, came two wide into
 the lane, failed to threaten and earned the show award. MENEHUNE was steadied at the start, stalked the pace, moved up three wide at the quarter pole,
 came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. IL NONNO trailed the field, saved ground and lacked a rally. BODHI DOG vied two wide and tired.

 POWERLINE sped to clear lead at the start, widened advantage on top without asking, saved ground along inside, came under drive in stretch, continued
 clear. RECALIBRATING was unhurried in early stages, set down for drive and finished well along outside. TOO COOL FOR YOU stalked the leader through
 backstretch, hustled up in far turn, continued driving in lane, drifted wider in late drive and lost place. GEH SCHNELL saved ground along rail in the far turn,
 dug in three wide upper stretch, continued steady bid while drifting wider. TO YOUR HEALTH raced well off early pace, showed response in stretch and
 improved position. GIANT'S VOICE stalked the clear pacesetter then shaken up for drive, came out wider and flattened out. WALKER'S LANDING raced far
 back, saved ground and hustled up along inside entering lane, angled out and failed to threaten. ROCK EAGLE dwelt at the start, trailed the field.
 LEVERKUSEN raced wide into stretch and failed to move on. THUNDERINWILLIE dropped back and offered no late run.

 Footnotes
 DANCE STRIKE was steadied at the start, pulled while racing four wide entering the first turn, settled off the pace, advanced inside at the quarter pole,
 came through on the rail entering the stretch, closed willingly inside and drew clear. MEMORY BANK raced four wide early, then pressed the pace, dueled
 between rivals on the far turn, drifted in interfering with WHAT POWER at the eighth pole, then dug in gamely inside and prevailed over ROBUSTO for
 second. ROBUSTO was bumped at the start, stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn and was outfinished late for second. MAJOR KEY stalked
 two wide, waited for room in traffic in upper stretch, then lacked a late bid and got the nod for fourth. SLAIMY was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace
 inside, came four wide into the lane and gained mildly. COLEMAN ROCKY raced off the pace between rivals, angled out at the furlong marker and gained
 mildly between rivals. WHAT POWER tracked inside, waited for room turning for home and was forced to check behind MEMORY BANK at the eighth pole.
 LITTLE BALTAR was bumped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, moved up three wide on the far turn, came six wide into the lane and failed to
 threaten. ARCHVILLAIN raced three wide early, then vied inside for command, dueled on the turn and tired. DEVISE was fractious in the gate, raced four
 wide early, continued three wide and faded. After a Jockey's Objection by the rider of WHAT POWER, MEMORY BANK was disqualified and placed
 seventh for interference at the eighth pole.

 PUPUTOV was rated in early stages, moved up between rivals approaching quarter pole, dueled for the lead, took slight edge and held firm approaching
 wire. FAITHFUL SUE vied for lead then took clear command going through far turn, drifted out losing ground entering top stretch, dueled for lead with
 eventual winner, battled back then lacked final kick to get by. KARENINA settled in early stages, swung wide for the drive and steadily edged up closer to
 the wire. OH WHAT AH MOMENT vied for lead then took breather off leader in far turn, made game rebid up rail to duel for lead, could not sustain bid in
 deep stretch. NICKY'S WARRIOR was rated off early pace, saved ground then angled out turning for home, responded when put to drive then flattened out.
 MICHELLE'Z LAUGH hesitated at the break and raced in the back, roused for response along outside at head of the lane, showed response but needed
 more for late impact. J C'S PROUD KITTEN bobbled then bumped at the start, stalked up close along inside, hut the rail near three eighths pole losing
 momentum, kept along in turn then faded in the lane. UNION GAL raced off the pace and had no late response. CALYPSO KEY drifted out in first turn,
 launched bid in far turn then drifted wide entering drive and offered no late run. INCA PRINCESS showed early response then dropped back.
