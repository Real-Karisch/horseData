 Footnotes
 CINCY BELLE angled out nearing the three quarter pole and prompted the pace outside MYDRINKSELECTION, moved to command soon into the lane,
 kicked clear after being set down leaving the quarter pole, kept on under left handed rousing to the sixteenth marker, had her rider put to stick away and
 held firm. FLEET FLAME stalked towards the inside, eased out for the drive, churned on willingly and nabbed the place in the final yards.
 MYDRINKSELECTION cleared early, set the pace off the rail, was taken on nearing the stretch, ceded the lead soon after, gave way grudgingly in the final
 seventy yards and just lost the place. FED UP FIRED UP settled off the pace, came six wide for the drive and slowly gained. LA LA BAMBA stalked the
 pace three to four wide, was put to a ride leaving the three eighths, drifted in some near mid stretch and faded. CHEF KAREN , unhurried early while saving
 some ground, eased out to make a slight move between rivals nearing the lane then faded.

 TRULY HOT lacked speed, angled to the seven path entering the stretch, closed on her left lead and was up in time. SAZERAC GIRL , pinched back
 leaving the starting gate, was caught behind horses entering the stretch, angled to the six path approaching the eighth pole and closed gamely between
 horses. SHE'S ACHANCE TOO showed speed along the inner rail, dropped back a bit on the turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch, chased the
 pace and faded. BALTIMORE STREET , forced in a bit leaving the starting gate, moved up in the five path in upper stretch and finished evenly. HAVE
 HOPE , four deep entering the turn, moved up three wide entering the stretch, gained a short lead in upper stretch, raced on her left lead and weakened.
 MARIE FROM PARIE came in leaving the starting gate, rushed up to gain a two wide lead down the backstretch, remained prominent to mid stretch then
 tired. SIX TONSAFUN bore out leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path turning for home and came up empty. THISSONGISABOUTYOU prompted
 the pace racing between horses and gave way. GIMME KIMMY , five deep on the turn, was not a factor.

 HODOR stalked four wide outside rivals, came under some pressure mid turn, moved to a slim lead nearing the lane, kicked clear near the three sixteenths
 and held firm under a drive. KAITAIN , confidently handled off the rail and in range off of a contested pace, angled five wide and had aim into the lane, came
 under a ride leaving the three sixteenths, failed to seriously kick on but was willingly enough to be clear of the rest. SOUTHERN BARBECUE vied three
 wide between foes, failed to match strides past the three sixteenths, gave way grudgingly and held on for the show. MY TRAIN stumbled soon after the
 break, settled early five wide, was under a ride mid turn but failed to seriously kick in. IMMUNITY stalked the pace four wide, was under pressure into the
 lane and lacked a bid. THE TORTOISE edged up along the inside leaving the three quarter pole and prompted the pace, threatened along the rail while
 under pressure mid turn, forced the issue into the lane then tired. HOT AND HEAVY set a pressured pace off the rail, was surrounded mid turn and faltered
 in upper stretch.

 AND FLUTTER , three wide on the turn, had aim on the leader in upper stretch and flattened out. HONOR AND BLESSING , two wide on the turn, chased
 the winner and weakened. FAITH 'N WORKS , four wide leaving the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. FLINT HILL raced
 inside horses entering the turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch and was not a factor. DA'BLUES DANCER , four wide on the turn, was taken to
 the five path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. COTTON PRINCESS circled the turn three wide, was four wide entering the stretch and gave way.
 SWEET TANDY raced in the two path on the turn and was no factor. KITTY BANK , outrun, raced four wide on the turn and angled to the six path in upper
 stretch. SMARTY'S LEGEND , bumped leaving the starting gate, chased the pace racing along the rail and faltered.
