 Footnotes
 SPUN TIGER sprinted clear soon after the start, was well rated through the back-stretch, drifted out into the lane and was ridden out to be kept to task. WIN
 HANNAH LYNN was away in good order to chase the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that foe in the drive but finished well to be clearly
 second best. JINN WIN was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. MAMAS POWER was
 forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through both turns and gradually weakened. UNBRIDLED BIRDIE lagged throughout.

 ZIGGY CAR DUST broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the half-mile marker, remained in control through
 mid-stretch and held sway to the wire. SILVER ATTACHE was bumped at the break, raced unhurried early, advanced from off the rail through the turn,
 angled out into the stretch and finished willingly. GOLDSLINGER pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and lacked the needed closing
 response. HONKYTONKBAR settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. FRENCH CANDY pressed the
 pace of the winner while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. LOOK AT MY STAR lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and
 failed to rally. PONYBOYS BROTHER was off a step slow and bumped, lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace.

 Footnotes
 CHEROKEE LOUISE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore ALGORITHMNBLUES in the final yards.
 ALGORITHMNBLUES set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear lead nearing the five-sixteenths marker, remained in control through
 mid-stretch and just failed to last. TAPTOO was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch, angled back inside late and finished
 evenly. HAMMY TIME broke sharply to press the pace of ALGORITHMNBLUES from the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and again in
 mid-stretch and gave way. SILVERSONIC showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. FELDY was away in good order
 to show brief speed and weakened.

 Footnotes
 HE'S NOT GREY was away in good order to dispute the early fractions with GUARDINGTHEMONEY while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival after
 going a half, opened a clear lead into the lane and held sway to the wire. IRON ROB was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the
 stretch, could not reach the winner but finished willingly. GUARDINGTHEMONEY broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner from off the rail and
 gave way through the final furlong. TUMAC MOUNTAIN broke awkwardly, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.
 ATTERCOP was off a step slow and lagged throughout.

 Footnotes
 RONTON lacked early speed, advanced from off the rail through the second turn, reached the fore inside the furlong marker and quickly drew off. LONG
 GAME stalked the pace of BOTCH while racing four-wide, moved up to take a brief lead in mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner but finished
 well to be clearly second best. DOCTOR BRUCE S. was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, maintained a striking
 position into mid-stretch and finished evenly late. BOTCH sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and weakened after going seven
 furlongs. BROMANCE lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. KALAKALA raced off the pacesetters early,
 moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened.
