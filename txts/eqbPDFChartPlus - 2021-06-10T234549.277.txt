 Footnotes
 WE WILL RE JOYCE had the best speed and was in the lead quickly, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to edge clear to mid stretch then
 held on determinedly despite not switching leads. PEPPERED JO was outrun to the turn, came two wide to the stretch but finished willingly in the final
 sixteenth. I LOVE ROMANCE got outsprinted early, raced two then three wide to the stretch and was also gaining ground belatedly. COLONEL DEERING
 broke a bit slow, hurried up inside to track the winner, had to wait off that one's heels leaving the half mile pole, saved ground to the stretch then could not
 offer the needed late response. CLEAN LIVING prompted the pace two wide to the stretch but was giving way in the final furlong.

 Footnotes
 ROYAL CHARM was outsprinted to the turn, eased off the rail and swung out four wide while rallying into the stretch, pushed to the front leaving mid stretch
 and was under steady urging to the line. HOSS CARTWRIGHT hustled early to contest the pace inside of PEPPERINO, continued to duel that one to the
 stretch, resisted the winner to deep stretch then was an easy second. ZEDEKIAH had no speed, saved ground on the turn but could not impact the top two.
 SUN AND SHADOW (GB) hesitated in the gate for a beat and came out slow, had no speed, was three wide on the turn but never threatened. INDIAN
 HEAD NICKLE stalked the leaders to the turn, got outrun to the stretch and weakened. PEPPERINO hustled and dueled outside HOSS CARTWRIGHT,
 was three wide on the turn but tired through the stretch. RULES DON'T APPLY was never a factor.

 HOT MARKET battled INDIAN BRUT from gate to wire and nothing separated them. INDIAN BRUT stayed even with HOT MARKET throughout and
 deadheated. ADMIRAL BOOM had no speed, was two wide to the stretch and was making a mild run late. MARCHTOTHEMUSIC tracked the pace two
 wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. MERLE chased the winners three wide to the stretch but also lacked a closing bid.
 CRAWFORD'S GLOVE stalked the pace early, was three wide to the stretch and weakened through the drive. HERE AND THERE gave a dull effort.

 ORCHESTRAL showed good speed and dueled two wide to the second turn, responded when roused into the stretch and finished steadily for the win.
 BRONZINO (FR) stalked the leaders to the second turn, shifted off the rail and responded in the drive to get up for second. AZTEC WARRIOR had no
 speed, lagged to the second turn, closed the gap inside to the stretch and closed willingly but too late. WHISKY N ROSES also was lagging for six furlongs,
 raced two then three wide to the stretch but could only closed the gap without threatening. WE'RE JUST SAYIN got outsprinted, settled for a half mile, was
 three wide to the stretch and did not offer the needed response. RIDEO hustled early, dueled from the rail to the second turn then tired and gave out in the
 drive.

 out three wide to the stretch and finished willingly. WARM ENDOWMENT broke a bit tardy then settled to the second turn, circled five wide to the stretch but
 went evenly in the final furlong. AWARD IT had no speed and was never a threat. CHRISTIANA'S SONG also had no speed and was not a factor. AMBER

 Footnotes
 BOLD INTENT was unhurried to the second turn, raced two wide while in traffic to the quarter pole, waited, stepped out once in the stretch for room, rallied
 steadily and prevailed. TIZNO'S DILEMMA was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch then responded
 willingly in the drive but was outfinished to the line. SKEETER DAVIS pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, took a short lead to
 mid stretch then could not hold off the top two. DAHLIA AZUL attended the pace to the second turn, got outkicked to the stretch and finished evenly.
 CHEROKEE IN ME was outrun early, pushed up leaving the half mile pole and rallied three wide to the stretch then faded in the drive. QUEEN OF TROY
 set the pace under pressure for six furlongs then gave out.
