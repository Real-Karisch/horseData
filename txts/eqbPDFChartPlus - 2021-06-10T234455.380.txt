 outside past midstretch to go clear for the runner-up spot. SON WILL was close to the leaders toward the inside to the turn, rallied three wide past the
 quarter-pole, then flattened out through the last furlong. JACOPONE came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RAZOR SHARP sprinted clear
 down the backstretch, lost the lead to DIAMOND CAT midway around the turn and steadily gave way. DIAMOND CAT went up outside RAZOR SHARP to

 Footnotes
 ROCKY RIVER was quickly on a clear lead inside, remained in command past the eighth pole, then dug in gamely to preserve the decision. I DIDN'T TAKE
 IT chased the winner from the start while clear of the rest, kept on determinedly through the final stages between horses and just missed.
 WHATDOISTANDFOR saved ground early, rallied three wide coming off the turn and closed steadily outside the top two to be beaten narrowly for the larger
 shares. LEAVEITALONELARRY broke awkwardly at a cost of two or three lengths, trailed for a half-mile, moved out to the four-path in the stretch and was
 going well late. SIMON THE CYRENIAN was outrun to the top of the stretch three wide, shifted to the far outside and gained ground belatedly. STONE
 CROSS saved ground and lacked a late response. LONG LEGACY raced two wide in the middle of the pack around the turn, and failed to muster a rally.
 EUROSTORY was within striking range three to four wide on the turn, but had nothing left turning for home.

 CODE OF VALOR sped to the lead slightly off the inside, maintained a clear advantage into the lane and was never in serious jeopardy. SHANNON'S
 CASEY chased the winner throughout toward the inside and kept on willingly to be second best. LIL BEEBE improved position along the inside through
 upper stretch, and lacked a final bid while hand-urged. PRINCE OF THORNS trailed inside to the lane, came off the rail passing the eighth-pole and finished
 with some late interest. IT'S TURBO TIME chased the winner three wide for a half-mile and faded through the stretch. WELL OFF raced three to four wide
 around the turn and made no headway late. KISSIFUR chased outside the leaders four wide to the turn and was finished after a half-mile.
