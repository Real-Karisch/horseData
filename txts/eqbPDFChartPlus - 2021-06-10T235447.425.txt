 ELEVATE was rank inside horses into the first turn, settled on the backstretch, moved up inside the runnerup to engage for the lead into the stretch, dug in
 determinedly late and inched clear. THIN LINE had good speed, set the pace in the two path to the second turn, resisted the winner to inside the furlong
 grounds then was outfinished but never threatened for second. CURRY NATION had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then picked off a rival to get
 the show. PAPA JOE was also outrun to the half, saved ground on the second turn then finished evenly. NIZAMDCARCHY stalked the leaders three wide to
 the second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened. AERIAL DECOY settled to the half, bid two wide on the second turn but tired after six
 furlongs. ZIPPIN WINE was also stalking four wide to the second turn, remained four wide to the stretch but gave way in the drive.

 stretch then got outkicked for second. JOYOUS had no speed, was rank behind rivals and steadied hard at the seven sixteenths, raced three wide to the
 stretch then showed some late interest. SARAZONA TWO hustled early but was outsprinted by the winner, pressed that one from the rail to the stretch then

 Footnotes
 ON THE KEY was outrun for a half mile, bid three wide into the second turn, swung out five deep into the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily
 to prevail. ON THE WINGS OF was settled to the half, saved ground on the second turn then closed ground willingly but too late. CANDY'S MARTINI was a
 pace factor for six furlongs while two wide, pushed to the front in mid stretch, dug in late but could not hold. HEY SEQUOIA was outrun for a half mile, bid
 four wide on the second turn, swung out widest for the drive and closed willingly but also too late. KITTEN'S ROYAL tracked the pace to the second turn, bid
 three wide to the stretch and finished steadily. COOL HUNTER also was tracking the pace while two wide, responded on the second turn, stayed on to mid
 stretch then weakened. JUNE TWO FOUR had no speed, lagged for six furlongs and was not a factor. SMOKED TOO MANY hustled to contest the pace,
 dueled from the rail for six furlongs then tired.
