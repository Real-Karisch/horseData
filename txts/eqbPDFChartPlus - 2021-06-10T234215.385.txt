 Footnotes
 LAURIANO asked a bit after the start to clear, was given a breather through the turn, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to
 task. HEART WARRIOR broke out to bother an outer foe, was straightened to race in the second flight off the inside, proved no match for the winner in the
 drive, clearly second best. FLASH'S ADVENTURE lacked early foot, came four wide out of the turn when staging a mild rally, finished up best of the rest.
 CHEAP SHOT broke in good order, raced in the second flight closest to the inside, weakened in the drive. GONE WISHIN bothered at the start to begin
 slowly, continued to trail into the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SNOOP THREE SOCKS settled in mid pack early,
 faded. CHARLIE GULCH was finished before a half.

 Footnotes
 JACKIE EMS PAL broke alertly, sprinted clear, relinquished the advantage midway on the turn, regained the lead while saving ground into the lane, shook
 well clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up comfortably safe in the late going under steady handling. LADY LORETTA within striking distance
 early, dropped inside turn, fell back a bit off the winner late in the bend, continued inside and got through a furlong out, finished up willingly. MY RUSTON
 broke back, lacked speed off the inside, steered out when straightened for home, rallied for the show outside. HEAVEN'S DEVIL off a step slow, trailed most
 of the way, improved late while not a serious threat. MISO SMOOTH back early off the pace, improved late in the turn off the inside, flattened out in the
 drive. SPIRIT OF A CAT within striking distance, had little left for the drive. SCOTTISH BU pressed the winner early, advanced and took over to be briefly
 clear midway on the turn toward but not on the inside, allowed that same foe the inside entering the stretch and gave way.

 TOP TEN DUCHESS never far back off the inside, went after the leader far turn, put a head in front entering the straight, long drive, dug in late to narrowly
 prevail in game fashion. GOTTABEGOLDEN forwardly placed off the inside, asked for run into the lane, steered out slightly, challenged three wide past the
 furlong marker, outkicked in the late going. MY MADELYNS ON settled off the pace and the inside, called on for some run when moving closer exiting the
 final turn four wide, inched closer, not enough in the final strides while widest of the first flight at the wire. LADY DARTH broke alertly, got clear early,
 showed the way up the backstretch, responded when challenge entering the stretch, proved stubborn until late. PARTY WITH KASSIDY last away, trailed
 most of the way in failing to menace. HEATHER DIVINE lacked a closing response.

 be up in time. SET HUT off the pace and the inside, roused when straightened for home closed ground late inside the winner, late bid between foes, missed.
 DARYLSLITTLEENGINE dueled up front while racing off the inside, shook off the other speed late in the turn, well clear nearing midstretch, could not
 contain the top two. MIGHTY INTIMIDATOR dueled up front early along the inside, began to weaken before three furlongs. LIP SERVICE last away, trailed
 most of the way, failed to menace. UNK'S RED MAN tired while racing four wide.

 Footnotes
 WANNA SNUGGLE unhurried early while along the inside, angled out when advancing late in the final turn, quickly engaged the leader from the outside,
 strongly clear, ridden out. FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR dueled up front inside, shook off the other speed to be clear in the second turn, offered little resistance to
 the winner in the drive, clearly second best. TEMPLE SHADOW within striking distance after an alert break, continued in even fashion into and through the
 stretch in lacking a serious closing response, finished up best of the rest. ARGUMENTALLY ELLE void of early foot in trailing for six furlongs, improved
 position with a mild amount of late interest without posing a serious threat. SELENE'S ARGUMENT dueled early outside, began to gradually weaken after a
 half. Z PRIDE settled in mid pack early, had nothing for the drive. BECCA'S WHISPER hopped, off slow, never a threat.

 Footnotes
 CLOSING UP in the second flight in the two path, moved closer late in the turn remaining just off the inside, long drive, late bid, proved best in determined
 fashion. LETITHAPPENQUICK with the pace out of the chute closest to the inside, continued to force the issue along the rail, shook briefly clear nearing the
 furlong marker before giving ground grudgingly to the winner, narrowly gained the nod for the place. LIAISON HALO within striking distance outside, ranged
 up to vie four wide into the lane, extended drive to the wire, missed the place. I RUN FOR THREE broke alertly, pressed the issue off the inside, vied
 between horses out of the turn, weakened the final furlong. RELENTLESS ATTACK fell well back the opening half mile, displayed a modest amount of late
 interest after the issue had been decided. KISS OF THE WOLF broke in good order, showed the way out of the chute in the two path, continued to set or
 force the pace for five furlongs, weakened in the drive. IZZY B WINN remained back in failing to threaten. SILENT CRY last away, showed little.

 MONARCHOS PRAYER broke alertly, showed the way out of the chute under restraint, continued to set the pace toward the inside turn, roused for the
 stretch run, long drive, fully extended to prove narrowly best in a game effort. SUCKERFORAGREY midpack early, improved in some traffic late in the turn,
 three wide into the lane, late bid outside, missed. STAR PERFORMER forwardly placed, advanced in the two path into the lane, challenged between the top
 two inside the furlong grounds, also narrowly missed. SKEETER went one paced throughout, not a threat to the top three in the drive. FIVE STAR NAP back
 off the pace for a half, improved position slightly while saving ground to no avail. DATA GIRL lacked early foot, made little impact from well back. MISS
 GURETTA failed to menace. DESERT EMPRESS forwardly placed early outside, tired while five wide. APRIL MAE vied early outside, got out late in the
 turn, four wide into the lane, backed up.

 TIZ THE FAITH away well, raced with the pace between rivals, showed the way through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, found more late to hold the
 runner up comfortably safe. CARRY THE ONE back off the pace toward the inside, improved through some traffic into the stretch, set down for the drive,
 closest to the winner a furlong out, could do little more with that one in the run to the wire, clear of the others. SAINTS N MUSKETS last to leave after
 leaning into the late, lacked early foot, closer into the turn, steadied in some traffic three furlongs out, moved toward the inside, two path into the lane,
 finished up best of the rest without threatening the top two. OUR LUCKY BREAK broke alertly, set or forced the pace along the inside for just under three
 furlongs and began to weaken. KAYLIE'S BOOTS void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. AUNT BAE BAE in the second flight
 early outside, faded. SIXTEEN PUNCHES flashed brief early speed three wide and gave way.

 Footnotes
 CACHITO in the second flight early inside, angled out for room to be four wide into the lane, roused for the drive, closed with good determination to be up in
 time. BENTONVILLE with the pace from the start, vied three with through the turn, shook briefly clear when straightened for home, responded when
 challenged by the winner and proved stubborn to the end, clearly second best. TEN BROWNIES back off the pace while racing outside, fanned six wide into
 the lane, staged a mild rally down the middle of the strip to annex the show, no threat to the top two. SINGINGINTHEWIND off a bit slow, improved by
 saving ground into then lane, flattened out in the late going to lose the show in the waning strides. FLASHING ANGELBABY vied up front closest to the
 inside, faltered in the drive. NO MORE FOR U with the pace from between horses for five furlongs, also had little left for the stretch drive. ST. PETE'S
 CROWN void of speed for five furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. CLEVER RACER second flight while outside, floated out five
 wide into the lane and tired. UNCLE HERBIE steadily faded.
