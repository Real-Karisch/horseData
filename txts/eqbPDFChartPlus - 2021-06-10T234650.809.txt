 steady going by wire for first turn, continued to pull and steady into backstretch, waited briefly then gained inside near quarter pole, shifted out, dueled
 heads apart for late lead, got outkicked by late gaining winner, nipped for place. JAGR raced off pace, saved ground along inside in far turn, shifted out
 mid-stretch then finished evenly. BETTING ON RED was reserved arcing in the back, gained along inside upper stretch then flattened out. KING STORMY
 lacked early speed, urged for response upper stretch, lacked needed rally for impact. GOLDEN AWAY was restless in gate then came away step slow,
 steadily gained ground along outside reaching up close position in backstretch, pressed the pace then failed to move on in lane. OSVALDO raced up close
 behind leader then moved up to apply pressure to STUN, continued up close bid then failed to sustain bid in stretch. PROMINENCE raced off pace six path

 Footnotes
 LIL'S FAST BOY dueled along outside of FLYING ROCKET just after start, continued to match strides then edged away midway through turn, continued
 driving into lane and widened margins on top to the end. FLYING ROCKET dueled along inside of LIL'S FAST BOY through backstretch, continued on equal
 terms then failed to move on with eventual winner past five sixteenths pole, continued steady outside bid in lane securing place. ONE CLASSY DUDE
 bumped gate at start, continued unhurried, gained along inside through turn, moved off inside then evened out, managed to hold share in final stride.
 SANTIAGUERO broke with top flight then continued in range off top trio, was no match for top pair, moved to widest in lane, just missed minor share. WILD
 LIL' KITTEN raced in the back, roused widest of all in lane, failed to make impact. MAGIC MACK urged for response at start and moved up on near equal
 terms for lead, could not sustain bid in turn, faded. PIONEER KID lacked early speed and saved ground along inside then dropped far back.

 BAMA BOUND raced up close in first turn then inched up to race on equal terms with WARRIOR A.P., began to move away from rival while taking on MAL
 GUAPO in turn, continued to battle back gamely from inside despite prolonged pressure, finished determinedly. MAL GUAPO was rated off top two leaders
 in the backstretch, wanted to do more but remained well handled and waited then inched up to match strides for lead near quarter pole, dug in along outside
 of BAMA BOUND through lane, lacked needed kick to get by stubborn foe, finished clearly second best. GRAN IDENTIDAD raced along in range through
 backstretch, saved ground along inside in far turn, was no match for clear top pair but continued steady bid gaining show. HY QUALITY PRINCE was
 unhurried in early stages, picked up pace past half mile marker, gained position in far turn, kept under drive into lane then flattened out. SIR SPARKY saved
 ground along inside into backstretch then moved off inside, came under outside urging at head of lane, needed more for impact. TEMPIETTO raced in the
 back, passed tiring foes while never reaching threatening range. KHAMSA TFU showed response in early stages then retreated after half. INAVANTI raced
 off pace although not far back at half, failed to continue on, dropped back. REAL STEEL raced five to six wide in first turn then continued in range near
 midpack, came up empty after half. WARRIOR A. P. led the way into backstretch, vied for lead along inside of eventual winner, could not keep up pace
 three furlongs out, quickly retreated.
