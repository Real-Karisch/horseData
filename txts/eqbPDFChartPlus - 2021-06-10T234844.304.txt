 Footnotes
 ZAGURI unhurried for a half, responded readily when set down, circled horses rapidly four wide on the far turn, made the lead in upper stretch then widened
 under left handed urging to win as much the best. IMPERIAL SLIPPERS checked along the rail when outside rivals dropped inward leaving the first turn,
 shifted out, rallied three wide on the far turn making the lead, set the pace into the stretch then was no match for the winner. SCAMANDER bore out at the
 start bumping hard with HONDO GUSTO, offered a mild bid on the far turn then lost ground. ROCK ON DUDE pressed the pace two wide around the first
 turn, dropped inside, remained a sharp threat for a half then gradually gave way. HONDO GUSTO was bumped hard at the start then failed to menace.
 STORMY JASON vied for the lead three wide, led between calls before the far turn then came up empty. RAZOR SHARP away alertly, set the early pace,
 was through after a half and stopped to walk. RECOVERY TIME checked on heels entering the clubhouse turn, shifted out to the five path, rushed to the
 lead before a half then had nothing left.
