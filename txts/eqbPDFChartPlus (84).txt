 Footnotes
 WOLFINBARGER came in some leaving the gate, brushed repeatedly with ALMOST PERFECT while outside that one on the backstretch, raced two wide
 around the turn, was bumped soundly in early stretch while vying outside the early leader and narrowly bested that one after a stiff drive. REX'S LEGACY
 opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed close to the rail around the turn, bore out under left hand whip in early stretch, bumped the winner,
 continued to bear out until switched to right hand whip and was outfinished. INSIDER was slow early, raced two wide around the turn then closed willingly
 outside. BOYS OF QUEENS came in, bumped HE'S ZIPPIN ON BY while slow from the gate, lagged inside, made a run between horses into the final
 furlong and finished willingly. SPIRITS LEGACY stayed out from the rail and tired. HE'S ZIPPIN ON BY was bumped while slow from the gate, raced three
 wide and failed to matter. ALMOST PERFECT brushed with the winner while not far back along the inside on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
 and faded in the drive. MANAHAWKIN was outrun three wide.

 Footnotes
 SHOE LOVES SHOE broke out, stalked the pace setter from the four path before vying for the lead in the three path at the seven-sixteenths pole, forged an
 advantage at the five-sixteenths pole and drew off readily approaching the quarter pole, then held sway through the lane. FINAL RITUAL was forwardly
 placed in the two path through the turn, split foes in the two to three path at the furlong pole and prevailed for place. DOUBLE SKY was forwardly placed in
 the three path, but proved no match for the leader at the quarter pole, came into the lane in the four path, but was outfinished for place. SPOTMEIFUCAN
 stalked the pace along the rail, but was outpaced by the leader through the turn, then got oufinished by multiple foes in the late stages for minor rewards.
 BLAME WILL raced in midpack while four to five wide and outside of horses, but finished evenly. NEGRITO raced in midpack from the four path between
 horses, but failed to factor. COUZINS GONE WILD was jostled between horses at the start and a couple lengths slow, settled far off the pace along the
 inside down the backstretch, came into the lane in the three path, but failed to menace. ALBERTOS AL QUINTO saved ground while midpack around the
 turn, but to no avail. BIRD CALL bumped an inner rival at the start, trailed the field through the turn, came into the lane in the five path, passed an easing
 rival, and was never involved. RING COLLECTOR set the pace from the two path, but was confronted by SHOE LOVES SHOE at the seven sixteenths
 pole, then headed by that rival at the five sixteenths pole, was quickly put to drive, but had no response, stopped in the three path between rivals into the
 lane, and was eased through the stretch.

 CHARMING DEPUTY wasn't far back in the two path, launched a four wide bid before six furlongs, was carried wide nearing the stretch, took over leaving
 the furlong grounds and drew out late. BABALIGHT was shuffled back from between horses entering the first turn, rallied the rail around the final turn,
 moved to a short lived lead while running out into the stretch and couldn't match the winner through the final furlong. VOW'S SON was caught in the four
 path around the first turn, wasn't far back in the five path around the final turn and lacked the needed closing response. PENDRELL MOON lagged after a
 slow break, made a run along the rail to get closer in early stretch then wasn't persevered with through late stretch as the rider stood up before the finish.
 HERE COMES GARY pressed outside the early leader in the three path, moved to a short lead into the far turn, bore out into the winner midway on the final
 turn then stopped in the lane. An objection by Sheroski against the winner was not allowed. BATTLE TAP made the pace in the two path to the far turn,
 stopped in the lane and was eased up late.

 Footnotes
 ROSES FOR RUBY rated in midpack along the rail through the first turn, split foes and commenced a rally into the far turn, gained to be in striking range
 into the lane, tipped to the three path in upper stretch to be outside of the leader, then drove past in the final seventy yards. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE
 cleared early on, set the pace while maintaining a loose lead around the far turn, came into the lane in the three path, but drifted in in upper stretch, then
 was caught in the final seventy yards. ZARBANDA saved ground while far off the pace, split foes in the two path at the quarter pole, then stayed on through
 the lane without threatening the leaders, and was best of the rest. LAST GREAT chased in the two path between horses around the first turn, but failed to
 keep pace passing the five furlong pole, then stayed on into the lane, but was no menace. YOUARESTILLTHEWON raced in the two path while midpack,
 took the turn in the five path while outside of rivals, then had no rally. MISS OMNIPOTENT stalked in the three path, was driven into the far turn while failing
 to keep pace with the leader, had no response, then weakened in the four path through the lane. SOMETHINGFANCY showed little. MOXIE MOMENTUM
 stalked the pace setter along the rail through the first turn, but the rider lost his irons into the backstretch, and was eased thereafter and galloped across the
 wire.

 Footnotes
 HELLO'NDUBAI broke sharp to quickly establish a clear lead, stayed clear through the turn before widening his margin into the lane under driving pressure,
 then was hand ridden from the furlong pole. IT'S NOT FUNNY broke out, stalked from the two path into the turn while getting outpaced by SAINT MICHAEL
 for the place spot, shifted outside of that rival and came into the lane in the three path, then drifted to the five path at the furlong pole as that foe drifted as
 well, but rallied for place in the late stages while hanging on his left lead. BUBBALOVE settled in midpack along the rail, but was shuffled back into the turn
 as MAGRITTE weakened, tipped to the path at the five sixteenth pole, then offered a mild rally between horses in the late stages, but was not enough for
 place. SAINT MICHAEL had a tardy start and was off last, rushed in the five path while outside of rivals to a stalking position passing the half mild pole,
 tracked the loose leader from the three to two path around the bend, but was no match for that foe into the lane, then weakened and got oufininished for
 minor rewards. SATURDAYNITEAFFAIR was forwardly placed in the three path, angled to the rail into the turn and saved ground around the bend, but was
 outfinished by outer foes in the late stages for minor rewards. SILENT ALARM was forwardly placed in the four path, but weakened into the lane. BUZZ
 WITH ALEX brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced far off the pace in the two path down the backstretch, took the turn in the four to five path, and
 lacked a rally. TOTALLY UNEXPECTED was pinched back between horses at the start, raced far off the pace in the four to five path around the turn, and
 never got involved. TWICEASLUCKY was bumped at the start, raced far off the pace in the four to five path, yet inside of rivals, then drifted to the eight path
 late while getting outrun. MAGRITTE raced in midpack in the two path, but weakened along the inside into the turn and subsequently stopped.

 Footnotes
 ADREAMGOESONFORVER was fractious in the gate, showed speed from the outset, moved clear midway on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail
 around the turn and bore out under left hand whip while drawing off in the stretch. CHIEF BOW NO MOVE chased early, was urged along in the three path
 around the turn and tired in the lane. GOLDEN ACES wasn't far back early, was hustled in the two path around the turn then tired in the lane. NOTION'S
 BEAUTY was fractious in the gate, broke slowly, raced two wide between rivals around the turn and outlasted tired ones while weakening. BUTTON CANDY
 was slow early, raced the three path around the turn and passed tired ones in the lane. COLOR FORCE briefly showed speed inside. BANKIN ON AN
 ANGEL chased the winner into the turn, angled to the rail and stopped. SUNNY HILL BOBBIE was finished early then was eased up late. SEMAYA became
 fractious in the gate just as the doors opened, broke slowly and never caught up.

 Footnotes
 SIR ROCKPORT had his head turned when the gates opened, then bobbled a bit and bumped an inner foe at the start, recovered and rushed through to
 grab the lead, cleared the field in the three path at the seven sixteenths pole, stayed clear through the turn before widening his margin in the four path in
 upper stretch, then was ridden out under hand urging to the wire. MAJESTIC CALLING settled far off the pace along the inside, was put to an all out drive to
 commence a rally into the turn, tipped three to four wide into the lane, then offered a mild rally between rivals to get up for place approaching the wire. C C'S
 WARRIOR stalked in the two path, but failed to keep pace with the leader into the turn, angled to the three path into the lane, then stayed on mildly, but got
 outfinished for place. BELLOWS raced in midpack from the four path, but was outpaced between rivals into the turn, angled to the five path and outside
 those foes in midstretch, and rallied past them for a minor reward. SUNRISE SATURDAY was midpack in the three path around the turn, came into the lane
 in the four path, but tired while hanging on his left lead in midstretch and got outfinished for minor rewards. MIDNIGHT JUSTICE prompted the pace in the
 four path down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with SIR ROCKPORT around the turn, drifted inwards to the two path into the lane, then
 subsequently weakened. HURRICANE BEAR was never involved while racing in the five to six path. SUPREME JUSTICE saved ground around the turn
 while far off the pace, but to no avail. FOREST GATOR was hustled from the start to vie for the lead inside of rivals, but was outpaced by SIR ROCKPORT
 approaching the seven sixteenths pole, then weakened while hanging on his left lead through the lane.
