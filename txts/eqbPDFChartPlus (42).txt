 Footnotes
 LIFE IN SHAMBLES was well held pressing the issue from path three, appeared to poke a head down approaching the end of the bend, was put to a drive
 spinning into the lane,inched away during the ensuing furlong, felt a pair of closers to the outside in the final seventy yards but dug in gamely to preserve the
 decision. PETE'S PLAY CALL pursued the front runners from path two along the backstretch, pulling a bit on the bit, swung into the action by swinging
 approximately three wide into the stretch, closed in with good late energy, missed. LONG HAUL BAY chased the pace from path two, got called upon for
 more prior to the quarter pole, was angled four wide into the lane, becoming the widest of all, gained steadily en route to securing the show. ALMITHMAAR
 cemented himself to the top after being put to some light encouragement, showed the way from path two, with the eventual winner applying some pressure
 one path farther off the rail, came under feverish urging getting displaced in the vicinity of the quarter pole, put up a fight to re-claim the front end from there
 to midstretch before weakenking. DELTA BLUESMAN set to a vigorous hand ride after springing from the gate, got out-sprinted, cut over to the inside, saw
 the hand urging cease right around the three-eighths pole, stepped into the stretch and had no response.

 HOLLYWOOD GLORY four then three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from
 home, swung three wide into upper stretch before tipping out a path straightened away, rallied to issue a challenge to the top battling pair through the final
 eighth seizing command a sixteenth out, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. ALASAAYIL established the front and showed the way in hand from the
 two path under some pressure from SHE'S A BLACK BELT to the outside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under increasing pressure from her
 main pace rival being put to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat, dug in under a drive holding stubborn
 through to the sixteenth marker when overtaken by the top one, came out at that station under a near sided stick bumping and lightly brushing SHE'S A
 BLACK BELT while battling head to head to the finish, brushed once more nearing the wire and held for the place honors. SHE'S A BLACK BELT four wide
 down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked two to three wide into the turn advancing to prompt the aforementioned foe from the outside under
 coaxing with three furlongs remaining, cornered three wide into upper stretch latched on, dug in under a drive battling now between foes through the final
 eighth, got bumped and brushed a sixteenth out by ALASAAYIL come out slightly under a near sided stick as the eventual winner went on by to the outside,
 dug in and was brushed once more nearing the finish and was bested for the place honors while well clear of the rest. LIMAGE two to three wide in pursuit
 down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths tipping out four wide through the turn, continued four wide into upper stretch and tired.
 TWEETY KITTEN chased two to three wide striding greenly and grew detached at the tail of the field, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing
 at the seven-sixteenths, cornered three wide for home and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 DOLCE LILI was kept on hold prompting the pacesetter from path two, went to the front end under her own power shortly after the third fraction had been
 posted on the board, felt the presence of ROMANTIC MOMENT turning into the lane, was finally called upon for more, this occurring in the general area of
 the three-sixteenths marker, dug in stubbornly to preserve the decision. COMPLICIT at or near the two path taking up the chase, swung four wide into the
 stretch, straightened away and finished willingly to garner the place. ROMANTIC MOMENT strung out three wide on both turns, drafted behind another from
 path two making her way along the backstretch, arrived at the midway point of the far turn and narrowed in, was given her cue challenging in earnest
 approaching the three-sixteenths pole, got staved off then flattened out just enough in the final stages to ultimately have to settle for the show. GUERRIERE
 (IRE) sat well rated tracking the front runners from the pocket for nearly three-quarters, inched her way towards the two path during the last leg of the run
 around the second bend, was on hold idling behind winner from upper to midstretch, got asked after having fallen back somewhat at the eighth pole, came
 up empty. PONTI SCHEME pursued the pace towards the inside route, got ridden three wide into the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. GOING OUT
 out-broke the competition and retained the advantage, was pulling on the left showing the way during the initial stages, proved no match once the top one
 was ready to make her move past the five-sixteenths pole, backed away steadily down the lane. WARRANTY shifted into the two path after the field had
 sent off and running, failed to respond when asked to pick it up at the five-sixteenths pole and wound up trailing throughout.

 Footnotes
 IMPERIAL HINT got brushed at the start by SILVER RIDE who came outwards slightly at the start, advanced between foes to take command just inside five
 furlongs remaining and showed the way three wide down the backstretch and just off the inside through the turn patiently handled, began to shake away
 under his own power near the quarter pole and cornered just off the inside for home at that station, got nudged to the off side at the three-sixteenths and
 shook clear in hand to the eighth pole, had the rider sneak a pair of peeks back over his right shoulder through to the finish to assess the competition and
 prevailed comfortably as the rider pleased on the wire. MR. CROW chased just off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked inside at the
 nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a
 good effort under a drive to secure the place honors clear of the rest while steadily cutting into the in hand winner to the finish. SILVER RIDE broke a step
 outwards brushing with IMPERIAL HINT, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to
 garner the show honors. SIGHTFORSOREEYES chased inside early on before tipping out to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing three
 furlongs from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish. STILL KRZ lunged to the near side at the start getting
 away a beat slow, chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MANIACAL
 coaxed along from the get go chasing along the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired. FORGE broke out a step at the start and was
 corrected, came under hustling and chased two to three wide coaxed along from the start, cornered just off the inside at the head of the stretch and tired.

 CHANNEL MAKER gained the top shortly after the field had been sent on its way, was at or near the inside vying for control, matched up with TEODORO to
 the outside, had no sooner shaken off the aforementioned coming up to the five-sixteenths pole when the second place finisher picked up interest, got called
 upon spinning into the stretch, turned back ROBERT BRUCE's strong challenge during the next furlong and kicked away. ROBERT BRUCE (CHI) towards
 the inside during the initial stages, got eased into path two at the head of the backstretch, began to close the gap readily leaving the three-eighths pole,
 commenced to get angled to the outside a sixteenth later, was under a drive and in path four stepping onto the top of the lane, came out briefly after some
 left side stick work at the furlong grounds, got staved off but forged onward in a willing manner to procure the place. SADLER'S JOY quickly guided over to
 the hedge, remained along it keeping an eye on the front runners from well behind, was put to a drive at the five-sixteenths pole, got driven into path six
 during the opening half of the stretch run, went on to finish a non-threatening third. HIGHLAND SKY took up the chase from path two, was under strong
 handling shifting into path five from upper to midstretch, made no impact. TEODORO (IRE) sparred with the winner towards path two until the five-sixteenths
 and gave way. CARRICK chased the pace two wide, had no response left when asked after more than halfway around the second turn, backed away down
 the stretch. SPRING QUALITY strung out three wide on both turns, folded.

 FORTY UNDER tracked the pace just off the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
 offered up a good kick to rally outside issuing a challenge to the leader nearing the sixteenth marker, went by inside that station and inched away to the
 finish to prevail. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN forwardly placed in the two path attending the leader, raced three wide into the far turn, inherited the lead three
 furlongs from home as OLE MOLE backed away to the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch,
 edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing lone threat to the outside, got caught inside the final sixteenth and was along clear for the
 place honors. SOCIAL PARANOIA settled just off the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing into the far turn tipped out four wide, swung three to four
 wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on through the stretch to secure the show honors. OPRY two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack,
 came under coaxing stacked five wide at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, flattened out in the
 late stages. SPIRIT ANIMAL stumbled at the start and appeared to kick out with his hind legs tossing the rider out of the irons and nearly off entirely save for
 the sound agility of the rider to stay on saddle, raced sluggih early as the rider restabilized himself conceding six to seven lengths to the front, settled three
 then two wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went four wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to improve
 position through to the finish. DASHING DAN veered in at the start bumping FORTY UNDER lightly into RHYTHM WITH SOUL, tracked the pace along the
 inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the stretch. VINEYARD SOUND shied
 in at the start filling the space left vacant by the veering in aforementioned foe, chased four then three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at
 the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and offered no response. RHYTHM WITH SOUL bumped lightly at the start by FORTY UNDER due to
 pressure from DASHING DAN, settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing along the inside three furlongs from home, swung
 three wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact. OLE MOLE stumbled at the start recovering under hustling to establish the front crossing to the
 inside into the backstretch, settled in hand along the inside showing the way through solid splits under attendance to the outside from
 SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN, yielded command nearing the three-eighths coming under urging briefly inside, retreated through the latter portion of the bend,
 cut the corner into upper stretch and folded. PIPES three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got nudged four wide half a mile from home by OPRY to his inside,
 came under coaxing following that rival five wide midway on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 DISCREET LOVER away in good order, was quickly set up along the inside route, vacated the premises and shifted into the two path at the top of the far
 turn, remained well in reserve cutting into the gap, got cued up proceeding to get maneuvered to the outside in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker,
 wound up six wide upon completion of the move and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, forged on ahead with good courage, wresting away the
 advantage in the shadow of the wire. THUNDER SNOW (IRE) strung out three wide on the first turn, tucked into path two at the half mile pole, ranged up to
 the front runners, was put to a drive spinning three to four wide into the stretch, got engaged in a three way tussle for the top soon afterwards, fought his
 way to a narrow lead with under an eighth to go, was forced to defend it against a resolute MENDELSSOHN to the inside, finally put that one that opponent
 away with about seventy yards remaining only to get reeled in by the winner. MENDELSSOHN saw the pilot take hold after brushing with PATCH at the
 start, dueled side by side with DIVERSIFY for a few strides before getting taken back, tipped into the two path and loosely drafted off the leader's right
 shoulder, came under a prolonged drive a short distance from that half mile pile, lost the cover of the pacesetter after that foe got guded over to the rail
 leaving the backstretch, closed in and took it to the leader coming up to the quarter pole, soon found himself between rivals, but with some space between
 them contending for the lead, began the final furlong leading by the slimmest of margins, released it reluctantly to the runner up shortly afterwards, battled
 onward before weakening in the final seventy yards. CARLINO loped along from the rail during the initial stages, tipped into the two path at the crown of the
 backstrech and would stay stationed in it all the way to the quarter pole, shifted closer to the rail after being roused for the drive home, altered to be outside
 a weakening DIVERSITY in deep stretch and went on to earn the last major check. DIVERSIFY was under some coaxing establishing the top after an
 abbreviated duel with MENDELSSOHN during the opening phases, showed the way with the aforementioned drafting a slight distance behind to the outside,
 tucked along the rail at the half mile, got put to the test at the end of the second bend, then came under even heavier pressure once the runner up burst
 upon the scene soon afterwards, yielded at the furlong grounds and backed away. GRONKOWSKI brushed at the start, took up the chase two wide, was
 under a ride spinning slightly wider into the stretch, made no impact. UNO MAS MODELO was worked over to the rail after undergoing a two wide journey
 leading up to it, failed to fire when put to a drive heading home. PATCH made light contact with the left side of the starting gate as the field was sent off and
 running, showed no ill effects and pursued the front runners from the two path to the end of the second bend, never made its presence felt.

 dueled through the final sixteenth to the finish to gamely prevail on the wire. FERDINANDA just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing
