 Footnotes
 BOURBON HONEY led the way under pressure from PIKI PIKI GIRL in early going, moved away from rival to clear lead, remained on top still unasked
 going through the turn, felt ASIAN MOONLADY cling in, came under strong driving finish and held clear. ASIAN MOONLADY raced six wide in early
 backstretch then angled in few paths, was rated off top pair racing inside of a rival, shifted out past quarter pole then set down for the drive, gained ground
 on BOUBON HONEY but could not get to rival in time, finished clearly second best. PIKI PIKI GIRL prompted pace in opening quarter then raced behind
 pacesetter, came under a ride at the quarter pole, continued driving into the lane, lacked late gain but clearly secured show. STILL BEAUTIFUL tracked top
 pair racing outside of a rival, hustled up five wide into the drive, moved in couple paths and failed to move on. SELFIE DAY raced in the back with NEW
 YORK GEM, moved away from that rival but failed to rally in the lane. NEW YORK GEM lacked speed and had no late response.

 Footnotes
 LITTLE BRIDGE lacked early foot and raced off top trio under spread out field, began to gather momentum midway through the turn, raced five wide into the
 lane, continued with good response and got up in time. CRAZY FOR SOFIA sent for lead at the start but failed to gain position and sat in tracking position of
 clear pacesetter, moved up to challenge EROTIC KISS for the lead leaving quarter pole, dueled upper stretch then took command, led deep stretch then got
 outkicked for the win. GALILEO'S AFFAIR lacked early speed then raced wide into the lane, moved out even wider and finished fast to the wire. ELEGANTE
 raced in range then came under a ride and took closer order, came under left handed drive and continued steady even bid to the end. EROTIC KISS roused
 to the lead at the start then quickly widened to clear advantage, challenged by CRAZY FOR SOFIA just past quarter pole, dueled upper stretch then came
 up tired and weakened. DUCHESS ABBY raced off the pace, hustled up along the inside, failed to gain threatening position. BELLA BLACK reared in air at
 the start losing ground and never seemed to overcome troubled start.

 COAL MINERS SON matched strides out of the gate then edged back into tracking position, picked up the pace in the turn, dueled with EASTER VIGIL for
 late lead, took over and drew away. EASTER VIGIL vied for lead racing outside of WIZARD WILLIE, shook free in turn, briefly held clear lead then took on
 challenge of COAL MINERS SON, fought back with game response but lacked needed kick in late reserve to move on. TIP SHEET raced off early speed,
 entered top stretch under four wide run, angled in two path, switched back out couple paths and produced solid finish for show. LITTLE DOUBT was well
 positioned outside in range at the quarter pole, hustled up five wide into stretch, gained then evened out in final furlong. WIZARD WILLIE dueled along
 inside of EASTER VIGIL at the start midway through the turn, could not match strides after dropped back in the lane. SATURADO raced in the back
 throughout.

 MO BOURBON broke sharp then challenged and dueled with NO DINERO for the lead, matched strides throughout the backstretch then took on challenge
 of MR JOSHUA while edging away from aforementioned rival, battled gamely along inside in stretch, refused to give up and got nose up to prevail. MR
 JOSHUA brushed back and forth with ELITE KID in opening stages, sat just off top pair then moved up to challenge MO BOURBON for lead at the quarter
 pole, dueled outside of rival through the lane, fought gamely and got denied by nose on the wire. NO DINERO dueled for lead at start racing inside of
 eventual winner, continued to battle leaving the backstretch then weakened when MY JOSHUA moved up to join pace near quarter pole, moved outside and
 kicked back in gamely for sharp finish. ELITE KID brushed back and forth with rival in opening stages, lacked speed in early stages, produced strong
 outside bid in the lane, surged to wire but was too late for serious impact. DADDY'S TELLER saved ground then sent two wide into stretch, moved out wider
 and finished evenly. STAY AGAIN raced off pace, hustled up four path turning for home then lacked needed response to move on. GOLANI raced in range
 off trio running through the backstretch then failed to sustain bid and dropped back. BOLD MINER was rated off early pace, saved ground to no avail.

 lane and finished well clear. TERRY'S CHARM was rated back off early pace, quickly gained along outside in the turn, set down for the drive but could not
 reach pulling away winner, finished clearly second best. RANGER'S COMING lost early position steps after the start, moved out then back in, made early
 move up inside to gain close contention, could not keep up pace and began to weaken midway through turn, kept on for share. MR FRENCH (GB) moved
 up inside after the start to take command and continued to set the pace leaving the backstretch, lost lead at five sixteenths pole to eventual winner, had
 nothing left in late reserve. SON OF GREATNESS raced in range, kept on two path past the half mile marker then retreated in the turn. FAST EDDIE E
 tracked five wide through the backstretch then dropped far back in late stages.
