 Footnotes
 VISUAL PUNCH chased outside then off the rail, bid outside to gain the lead in the stretch under urging and proved best. SPECTACTICAL dueled between
 horses then inside on the turn and edged a rival for the place. CATALE STORM stalked outside a rival then bid three deep on the turn and into the stretch
 and was edged for second. CO CO KID stalked inside, came out on the turn and three deep into the stretch, drifted in and lacked the needed rally.
 CONTRABAND dueled three deep then between foes leaving the turn and weakened in the final furlong. GOSPEL CHEROKEY chased off the rail then
 angled in for the turn, came out leaving the turn and could not summon the necessary response. CLEAR CORREDOR had speed between foes then stalked
 between rivals, continued outside a foe on the turn and weakened. MISTER RALPH broke a step slowly, went up inside to vie for command, steadied in
 tight into the turn and also weakened.
