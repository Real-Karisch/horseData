 CALL ME bumped at the start by THANK YOU SO MUCH who broke inwards, raced forwardly placed four wide down the backstretch, widened away as a
 pair with RAGING FIRE from the rest of the field, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, got bumped and leaned
 on three-sixteenths out, then traded a minor bump a furlong from home with RAGING FIRE, seized command a furlong from home and inched away to the
 finish kept to task. SANDY LANE coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide among a trio detached from the top pair, came under coaxing at the
 three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to loom outside the top pair a furlong from home but was ultimately repelled by the top one while
 along for the place honors. RAGING FIRE established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide under some pressure from CALL ME to
 the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under threat and bumped with his main rival at the
 three-sixteenths, traded a bump once more when headed a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. ADMIRAL BLUE chased five then four wide
 coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch offering up a minor bid, couldn't sustain the move and flattened out in the final
 furlong. THANK YOU SO MUCH broke in at the start bumping CALL ME, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide
 nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing just off the inside at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 ZANDORA at or near the two path in pursuit of the front runners on the backstretch, tipped into the three path coming up to the top of turn, was well held
 cruising towards the leader, rollled by shortly after three-quarters had been rattled off, was making its way to the three-sixteenths marker when asked for
 more run, gave it, drawing well clear, then saw the pilot resort to a light hand ride for the final sixteenth. BIZNESS BEAUTY away last, contently brought up
 the back of the pack, well out in the strip on the backstretch, departed it from path five, unleashed a steady advance from the top of the bend to its end,
 closed in on G. T. SONIA, shied away from that errant opponent in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, then completed its mission of securing second. G. T.
 SONIA grabbed control shortly after the field had been sent off and running, got set up in the two path, showed the way on a loosely-contested lead,
 released it without resistance after six furlongs had been run, lost contact down the lane, swerved out sharply several paths in total with approximately a
 sixteenth to go, narrowly avoding contact with the second place finisher, trudged on for the show. AVOCADO stalked the leader from the outside during the
 initial stages, undertaking the task four wide on the turn, came into the stretch and folded. KICKIN KIMBERLY gradually made her way to the rail, appeared
 to have little left by the five-sixteentsh pole, strolled very wide into the stretch, was eased down the lane, then walked off the track without need of outside
 assistance.

 Footnotes
 MAGIC FAIRY disputed the pace to the outside of RECESS during the opening half, shook free and cut over into the two path coming up to the conclusion
 of the backstretch, showed the way being attended by the runner up on the bend, saw that opponent increase her presence as three-quarters was being
 reached, settled in at the head of the stretch and was given her cue, turned back the challenger and edged away. LADY MACHO along the outside right
 from the get-go, was towards path four stalking the winner on the turn, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths marker as a prelude to taking it to the top
 one a sixteenth later, got staved off, continued onward for place honors. TWO GRACES three wide onto the turn, was sent six wide exiting it, proved no
 match. CARALICIOUS pursued the front runners two to thre wide on the turn, angled about five wide into the lane, got outfinished. PRINCESS PINKY
 secured a prominent position after the start, was two to three wide in pursuit of the pace on the turn, made it into the lane and folded. VIOLETAS VISIONS
 moved over to the rail after shying in at the start, was never heard from. RECESS an early pace contender, shifted over to the rail at the half mile after the
 winner had taken control, began to back away readily by the five-sixteenths, went into the lane and was allowed to fade away, rider applying a protective
 hold.

 CASSIES DREAMER traded a light bump at the start with STYLE AND GRACE, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three
 wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced through the latter portion of the bend to take command swinging four wide for
 home, drifted out straightened away before being corrected by an off sided stick, edged clear under a drive kept to task. STYLE AND GRACE traded a light
 bump at the start with CASSIES DREAMER, chased seven then six wide under light coaxing from the nine-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch,
 offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. FIGURE IT OUT six then five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with nine-sixteenths to go, went six to
 seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid then weakened in the late stages. DISTORTED NEWS broke out at the start and was corrected,
 established the front and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed for the front just prior to
 the quarter pole and went five wide at that station, then weakened in the stretch. ZEE DROP lunged slightly at the start, prompted the pace five then four
 wide under a ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired.

 SWEET MEADOW MIST away the tardiest after striking the left side of the starting gate, underwent a two wide pursuit, fanned out into path five for the drive
 home, charged at the leader with good momentum after being straightened away, rolled by inside the eighth pole and drew off smartly. IRISH LASSIE away
 forwardly placed, retained its prominent position, was two to three wide drafting behind the pacesetter on the turn, angled four wide into the lane, failed to
 keep pace with the winner but had enough to secure second. BEL CUORE grabbed control soon after the start, got guided into the two path, came under a
 drive coming up to the three-sixteentsh marker, was powerless to hold off the winner then weakened into the show slot. VAMPISH made light contact with
 the left of the gate at the start, underwent a ground-saving journey and faltered. FLYING PLEASANTLY bumped at the start, took up the chase three wide
 on the turn, gave way. DEVIL'S FLAIR bumped with FLYING PLEASANTLY in the shadow of the starting gate, never made its presence felt after diving over
 to the rail at the half mile pole.

 DYNAMAX PRIME four wide in pursuit down the backstretch at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three
 furlongs from home, went six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth and went on by the top pair inside the final seventy
 yards to prevail edging away at the end. DOUPS POINT traded leans just after the start with WHISTLING BIRDS jostling for position before angling briefly
 inside, chased two to three wide in closest aim of the leader before advancing to take over command nine-sixteenths from home, showed the way narrowly
 through the turn the innermost of a quartet latched on, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive under
 threat from RO BEAR and bumped with that rival just outside the eighth pole, dug in and was overtaken in the last jumps to the wire. RO BEAR five then
 four wide in range of the front, advanced into the turn to stack outside a pair while between foes placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three
 wide into upper stretch, dug in heads apart for command and was bumped nearing the eighth pole, fought on to the final seventy yards before beginning to
 back away and was up for the show honors. WHISTLING BIRDS traded leans shortly after the break with DOUPS POINT to his inside jostling for a lane,
 chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking five wide through the turn advancing to stack outside a quartet when placed to
 coaxing three furlongs from home, bid four wide at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, then weakened in the late stages. TEN TWENTY NINE six
 paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path nine-sixteenths from home, came under a ride at the three-eighths, went three wide into
 upper stretch and tired. BIG THICKET eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing
 seven-sixteenths out, went six wide at the quarter pole and made no impact. TRIP UPS spurted away on the lead early on four paths off the inside, tucked
 three wide nearing the nine-sixteenths and got headed for the front as DOUPS POINT took over nine-sixteenths from home, prompted that rival from the
 outside in the three path between foes as a quartet stacked across the track with three-eighths to run, got shaken off five-sixteenths out, swung three wide
 into upper stretch backing away and folded.

 Footnotes
 COME DANCING away last by a narrow margin, appeared keen assuming the role of primary pursuer afterwards, departed the backstretch stationed in path
 three, wrested away the advantage shortly after the second split had been finalized and edged away, saw the pilot sitting chilly atop approaching the quarter
 pole, even with all the others under encouragement in varying degrees at this stage, sauntered four wide into the stretch, lugged her way into path two when
 instructed to switch leads in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, kicked into gear and drew off. PACIFIC WIND at or near the inside in pursuit of the
 front runners during the initial stages, tipped out, becoming two to three wide at the three-eighths pole, was set down spinining approximately five wide into
 the stretch, proceeded somewhat erratically down the lane losing ground to the winner, but still displayed enough to earn a second best designation. PINK
 SANDS strung out four wide on the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, went on to secure the show. SUN STUDIO three wide onto the
 lane, moved out seven wide once into the stretch, made no headway. FROSTIE ANNE set the pace in the path two, relinquished once the winner was
 ready, got set down turning into the stretch and soon backed away.
