 Footnotes
 ALMOST A SAINT was well placed to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch then drew clear to mid stretch and was a handy winner. INFORMANT
 pressed the pace to the half, bid between horses on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and bested the others. SILVER BEAUTY had no speed,
 settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. SHEZ A GRILLER had no speed, offered a bid three wide on
 the second turn to briefly loom a threat but faded after six furlongs. ESKENFORANDREYA set the pace to the second turn but gave out in the drive.

 Footnotes
 MOONSHINE BAY stalked the pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then shifted out, rallied when set down and wore down ALL THAT ROCKS to
 the line. ALL THAT ROCKS set the pace while racing off the rail to the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch then was tiring, could not stall the winner but held
 second. MANDALA had no speed, bid three wide then swung five wide into the stretch then closed steadily but was too late for second. FLASH OF
 LIGHTNING was chasing to the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and was also gaining belatedly. MAN FROM LAGOS was outrun to the turn, saved
 ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. SIX VOTES pressed the pace three wide to the stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and
 weakened.

 Footnotes
 HER BIG MOMENT went right to the front, set the pace to the second turn, responded when set down and held determinedly. PLEASE DO never far back to
 the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then loomed a threat to mid stretch but was outfinished while besting the others.'. RALLY BACK got outsprinted
 to the half, bid two wide on the second turn then went evenly in the final furlong. AWAKEN MY SOUL was rank soon after the start and hard to place to the
 first turn, steadied off heels and dropped back to last, trailed to the second turn, swung four wide to the quarter pole then angled back inwards and finished
 willingly along the rail. THISSIDEOFHEAVEN had no speed, settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response. MARTINI
 EFFECT stalked the pace to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. RED CITY ZIP tracked the pace to the half,
 swung five wide on the second turn but came up empty in the stretch. SILVER MINX was chasing to the backstretch, pushed up to press the pace two wide
 to the stretch but tired in the drive. KARMA QUEEN was four wide early, settled to the half, tried to rally three deep on the second turn but gave way after six
 furlongs.
