 Footnotes
 MISS NOBILITY was ridden along through the early stages forced to go four to five wide around the turn with aim on the leader, drew alongside that one in
 upper stretch and drove clear inside the final sixteenth. ROHANA forced the pace inside, edged clear at the top of the stretch, was collared past the furlong
 marker and outkicked while clear of SWEET LIL KASEY, who tussled with the aforementioned on the front end and had no extra for the drive. CUCURRI
 COLLEEN lacked early speed, swung to the four path heading into the stretch and finished mildly. SKIPPITY DO DOM bumped the inner foe at the break,
 chased between rivals going three to four wide on the turn and had no late bid. MOONLIGHT WHO ran evenly and failed to make a bid. DEBBIE DEBS was
 bumped at the break, chased the leading pair in the two to three path and came up empty. LOTUS JADE was no factor.

 FEAR THE STINGER set the pace inside while hounded by rivals, was headed in upper stretch, regained the lead and edged away then just lasted from
 FLYING PAST WHO, who attended the pace between rivals, was ridden along by the five-sixteenths, lost significant ground turning into upper stretch,
 switched out and came again to just miss. ABBY'S DIAMOND advanced four wide on the turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch but could not kick on. IMA
 GENECAT MURPHY tracked the leaders inside, finished up with mild interest. HOT GROUPIE shifted five to six wide gaining into the stretch but needed
 more late. MCADOO broke outwardly, showed brief speed between, faded. WAY ENCHANTED showed little. TERA INFERNO tired.

 leading pair inside, shifted out to about the three path entering the stretch, ran on for second. IGNORE THE DANGER tracked the leading pair outside going
 in about the three path through the turn, altered course inside the aforementioned STUNNER entering the stretch and evened out late. ATLANTRA BROWN

 stretch coming out about two to three wide at that juncture and needed more late. WISH FOR LUCK dueled outside the winner, was carried seven wide by
 that one into the stretch and weakened. ROLL LYNDEE EYES shifted in early, failed to rally. THRILLA ATTILA was through early and tired.

 CHAS'S LEGACY stalked the leaders three wide, moved to challenge leaving the far turn, forged clear. ZIP TRIP prompted the pace outside, kept on to
 maintain the place. FOR THOSE WHO WAIT tracked the leading pair in behind under light ratnig tactics early, came out a path in upper stretch and gained
 show honors. DOWN TO THE WOOD set the early tempo then dueled inside a runner, gave way at the top of the stretch. INCLUDE ME NOW shifted in
 early, came out five wide at the top of the stretch and ran on. DEPUTY DIA was never near enough to threaten. SANTA ATLANTIC raced three to four wide
 mid-pack early then dropped back. BOLD TEMPEST was inside and never a factor. SIX FURLONG AND MILE TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER

 Footnotes
 DANZIG FLARE tracked the leaders going four to five wide on the turn, bid between rivals in mid-stretch taking the lead a sixteenth out and edging clear.
 WICKED PERTY advanced widest of all going five to six deep through the turn, kept on to just get up for second late from HOLIDAY CLOVER, who
 attended the pace outside roughly four wide, took a claer lead in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. BIG A'S DARLIN pressed the early pace,
 continued on three to four wide but needed more in the lane. CRAFTY MISS settled mid-pack inside, got through on the rail in upper stretch and finished
 evenly. SEASIDE FANTASY got away a step slowly, went three to four wide and improved. SPIRIT OF JOY settled at the rear, moved up in the stretch.
 BRITNEY'S GIRL pressed the pace between foes, dropped back and weakened. TIZABERRY was no factor. PUSH GIRL set the pace inside foes, entered
 the stretch in the two path and faded. PARLOR CAT made little impact.

 Footnotes
 MR. MCCOY caught three wide on the first turn, presed the pace, edged steadily away into and on the far turn, was well clear in upper stretch, never really
 asked for run and won geared down. NACI KNOTHEAD tracked mid-pack inside, switched off the inside coming to the midpoint of the far turn four wide,
 was no match for the winner while closing the gap and clear of the rest. DR. JESSOP raced outside toward the back, came into the stretch five deep and
 gained mildly. DOM JUAN eased back off the leaders entering the first turn content to track in behind, shifted out coming to the quarter pole four wide and
 finished up mildly. DIABOLIC POWER raced five to four wide through the first turn and continued in range of the leaders off the inside up the backstretch,
 had no late bid. WHO LEFT WHO set the early pace racing off the inside, vied inside a runner thereafter before weakening. GO BLAKERS GO eased back
 off the vanguard and shifted in a bit but still off the rail entering the first turn, failed to rally. BIG BLAZE was caught four wide on the first turn, in striking
 distance between the second group on the far turn then dropped back and faded. DILLWILLGETIT was no factor. GREAT ARTURO was no factor. SIX
 FURLONG AND MILE TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
