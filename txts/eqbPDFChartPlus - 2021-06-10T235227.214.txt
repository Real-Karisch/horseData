 PRIMED TO FIRE was sent to vie outside the early leader in the three path on the turn and was narrowly best after a long drive. SULTRY START took
 command at once, stayed out from the rail once clear after a furlong and gave way grudgingly. LUCKY TO THE MAX raced two wide between rivals in the
 second flight, moved closer on the turn then weakened. NATE'S LADY E raced three wide between rivals and failed to menace. GANS' PIPEDREAM
 showed speed inside into the turn and tired. PISUTORU broke slowly, bobbled soon after the break, raced four wide around the turn and flattened out.
