 Footnotes
 PUNTO DE ENTRADA broke sharp and saved ground setting the pace, ducked in sharply at the gap in midstretch then was straightened and continued
 gamely to hold off the challenge of LAST PLAY. LAST PLAY stalked the early pace, reached even terms outside the winner in the final furlong then was not
 quite good enough. QUEEN NEKIA moved closer around the far turn then finished evenly and held third. SCREEN IMAGE responded well in the drive to
 close a gap. OLD FLORIDA broke a step slowly then continued well and made up ground in the stretch. CHARMING EMMY broke alertly to be forwardly
 placed then faded in the drive. BLUE UNION RAGS tired from her early effort. GLITZ dwelt at the start then trailed her field.

 CASH MONEY ALWAYS was sent up around horses on the far turn, gained the lead nearing midstretch then edged clear late. PLAY IT AGAIN responded
 well in the drive to run down rivals in the final sixteenth mile for second. SHEIKINATOR was hustled up in the run to the first turn then stalked the pace
 inside, engaged the leader into the far turn then gave way grudgingly. EXTINCT CHARM set the pace under good handling then gave way under pressure.
 A SIXTIES TUNE prompted the pace to the far turn then weakened.

 SILENT TALE broke sharp to set all the pace, drew clear and was under steady pressure to prevail. RACY (GB) saved ground early, came out for the drive
 and closed gamely. AGAINST THE WIN lodged his bid from the outset and finished gamely to get up for third. NOTORIOUS COWBOY broke alertly and
 raced close up along the inside then lacked the needed closing kick. ARGOT raced close up outside horses and lacked the needed closing bid. CIRCLE OF
 LIGHT was checked when blocked along the inside in midstretch then angled out and closed gamely between horses. MERRY'S HONOR prompted the
 pace and was checked between horses when pinched off nearing the sixteenth mile marker. CAROLINA SPEED showed little. A claim of foul by the rider of
 MERRY'S HONOR against ARGOT for interference in the stretch was not allowed following a stewards inquiry

 Footnotes
 LAST CALL MHF shared the early lead inside then eased out from the rail into the backstretch to dispute the pace in the two path and won under a long
 drive. MISS PARADISE broke alertly to dispute the pace and fought it out gamely to the end. RISKY RED raced close up near the inside and finished well to
 best the others. PAMS MASQUERADE lacked a rally. JUNIA showed little. THROUGHLEAP broke a step slowly, moved up to prompt the early pace then
 tired.
