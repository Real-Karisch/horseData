 THE LUMBER GAL raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied outside of the
 runner-up in the three path on the far turn, took the advantage coming to the three-sixteenths and prevailed under strong urging. MAGICAL EVENING went
 to the front, lugged out some in the two path on the first turn, set the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, lost the lead nearing the
 three-sixteenths, kept on well in the stretch but missed while well clear for the place. MISS SHIRLEY C brushed with a foe after the start, rounded the first
 turn in the two path, was urged along at the rear, raced in the two path while ridden along on the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
 response. TOO BITS brushed with an opponent after the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled outside in third position, dropped back while urged

 Footnotes
 SOARING NOW went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, raced three wide on the far turn, was roused near the three-sixteenths, rallied
 outside into the final furlong, made a bid at the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. ANOTHER LEVEL broke out and bumped with a rival,
 angled in while going to the front then opened up, raced in the two path early on the first turn then dropped closer to the rail, continued well in front down the
 backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path, came under a drive in upper stretch, led until the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to hold the
 place. KITCHEN BOSS bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the back, went three
 then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. TELESCOPIC PLAN was restless in the gate, traveled
 around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, saved ground while roused on the far turn, drifted in a touch passing the chute and finished
 with late energy but missed the trifecta. SEXY DANCE went four wide early on the first turn then dropped to the two path, settled off the pace, dropped back
 under urging leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. MAGGIE TRUE bumped
 with a foe at the start, went three wide on the first turn, followed the solo leader from second, was ridden along passing the seven-sixteenths, raced inside to
 the two path on the far turn and tired. (Rail at 10 Feet)

 MARIA CHUCHENA (MEX) was urged along at the rear on the outside, went five wide on the turn, rallied outside while still on her inside lead in the stretch,
 switched to the proper lead inside the sixteenth-pole and got up late under strong handling in a blanket finish. HAY FLO chased the pace on the outside
 then in the four path on the turn, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, battled very gamely in the stretch and was denied while just able to get the place.
 MISCHIEF GALORE was hustled from the start, chased the pace, went around the turn in the three path, made a bid at the quarter-pole, battled very
 determinedly in the stretch but was also denied while just able to get the show. STORMIEIS BLUE settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path,
 waited while blocked in the vicinity of the furlong marker, dropped in then found room approaching the sixteenth-pole and gained late to just miss the trifecta
 in a four-way photo. FANCY STOCKINGS set the clear pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was headed at the three-sixteenths, dropped back
 into the final furlong and weakened. (Rail at 10 Feet)

 swung five wide into the stretch and finished with late energy to safely secured the place. CAPTAIN JOHN was taken back early, went three wide on the first
 turn, settled in the second flight on the outside, moved up with a half-mile to run, chased in the three path on the far turn and weakened but held the show.
 O SOLE MIO saved ground on the first turn, settled in the second flight while inside of a rival, dropped back near the half-mile pole, was urged along in the
 two path on the far turn, moved out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. MASLOW was keen under restraint early, raced in the two
 path on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and failed to
 respond. SAINT EDUARD was taken in hand early, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far turn
 and came up empty. SPARKS R A FLYING bumped solidly with a rival at the start, went three to four wide on the turns and was no factor. EXCALIBUR

 retreated. (Rail at 10 Feet)
