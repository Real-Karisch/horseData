 ZAPPER GIRL stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead down the backstretch, then drew off through the second turn and was ridden
 out. MO'S MISHAP allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch, then could not threaten the
 winner, while clearly best of the rest. VICKY'S SECRET allowed to settle, saved ground through the 2nd turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch
 and got up for the show. MIDNIGHT CANDY well placed and outside, looped three wide through the second turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and
 faded in the drive. SARATOGA FIELDS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and faded down the backstretch.

 SMARTY'S PAL broke out at the start bumping a rival, set the pace well off the rail, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task.
 DOREES GIANT NEAL bumped at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, bid three wide outside of that one, then could not threaten in the lane and held
 the place safe. SARATOGA CHARLIE chased the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain
 and missed the place. LAKE SURPRISE passed tiring rivals. CRAWFISH SHORTS was no factor. ATOMIUM well placed, steadily lost ground.
