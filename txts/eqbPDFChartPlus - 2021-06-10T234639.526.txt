 Footnotes
 CAPTAIN TRIPS , under the whip while vying outside GOLD BRIDLE, saw that one get away leaving the five sixteenths, came back under left handed
 rousing and challenged between foes nearing the sixteenth marker, took a short lead with about fifty yards remaining, drifted in and prevailed. LOVE N
 KIMESTRY settled off the pace, circled five wide advancing into the stretch, ranged up to be on near even terms past the sixteenth marker, drifted in battling
 outside the winner and hung. STAY ON POINT leaned in and brushed the gate, regrouped and settled off the pace, advanced inside leaving mid stretch
 then steadied when lacking room as the top pair drifted in nearing the wire. CREEPY THE CRAB flashed speed then was rated back off the leaders,
 dropped back two wide between foes around the turn, shifted out some and had a bit of late life between rivals. FEAR THE REAPER chased the pace four
 wide, altered out near mid stretch, moved up some past the sixteenth pole then flattened out late. GOLD BRIDLE vied inside the winner early on while in
 hand, moved clear without much asking mid turn, widened under some coaxing into the stretch, remained well clear in mid stretch then quit after being
 engaged nearing the sixteenth pole. DA VINCI'S VISION , three wide between foes mid turn, failed to threaten. An objection by the rider of STAY ON POINT
 against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was not allowed.

 Footnotes
 HASHTAG SELFIE took over at once, set the pace off the rail while handling some outside pressure, moved clear past the five eighths, widened after being
 set down in upper stretch, kept on under repeated right handed rousing inside the furlong grounds and held firm. TRULY HOT stalked inside, shifted out mid
 turn, circled four wide into the lane and closed willingly. CROOKIT , up close early, eased back off of foes leaving the three quarter pole, chased around the
 turn and lacked a bid. KENLAKE RESORT , four to five wide, failed to respond. BALTIMORE STREET , unprepared as the gates sprung, lunged and away
 a few lengths last, rushed up between, prompted three wide outside the winner, was under heavy pressure leaving the far turn and tired. BOOSTING was
 outrun.

 Footnotes
 DOIT FOR SPITE vied inside I B LIMMEY early on, rated back off that one near the half, angled out and came back in hand to challenge past the five
 sixteenths, spurted clear soon into the lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch and was clearly best while kept to task. CUT TIME chased inside,
 angled out around the turn, circled four wide into the stretch, advanced between foes near mid stretch and churned on willingly. STARSHIP YENTA was
 hard used from the gate, pursued off the inside, circled five wide and lacked a solid finish. SAY YES TO ME stumbled at the break, regrouped and settled
 well back, angled out in upper stretch and had belated interest. CORINTHIAN SHO GRL , off the pace and outside a rival, altered out off heels in mid stretch
 but failed to menace. SECONDTIMESACHARM dropped back early, raced wide and failed to threaten. PRIMA GOLD , three wide, dropped back. I B
 LIMMEY vied outside the winner, moved clear into the turn, was collared nearing the quarter pole and faltered. HONEST MISTAKE was outrun.

 Footnotes
 MAJESTIC REASON leaned in at the break and brushed with a rival, corrected and edged up inside, made a bold rail bid to command mid turn, eased off
 the inside entering the lane, dug in when confronted by OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE soon into the lane, responded to strong left handed rousing and shook clear
 inside the eighth pole then was resolute to the wire. OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE broke a step slow then steadied soon after, was taken five wide and moved up
 to be in range nearing the half mile marker, ranged up four wide to challenge approaching the stretch, dueled outside the winner leaving the three sixteenths
 and kept on gamely to the wire. TIMELESS CURLS , away alertly, chased three wide between rivals, failed to kick on with the leaders leaving the quarter
 pole, shifted in through the lane and faded. PANTYHOSE broke slowly then was taken to rate, saved ground leaving the three eighths, swung out leaving
 the quarter pole and had some late action. NORA'S DRAMA was nudged clear early, set the pace two wide, had the winner get through to her inside three
 furlongs out, vied to the head of the lane and tired. SWIFT VENGEANCE stalked between runners early, eased back nearing the turn, dropped further back
 mid turn, shifted out late and had some late interest. TOMA , off the pace and outside a rival, angled five wide entering the stretch but failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 MY BROTHERSLEDGE rated off the early pace, raced two wide into the lane, shifted out near mid stretch, closed under left handed encouragement, took
 command in deep stretch and was edging away at the line. KUKULKAN was gunned clear, set the pace towards the inside, remained clear under a drive
 past the furlong grounds, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. CANEEL BAY edged up between rivals nearing the turn, saved ground mid turn, came
 out for the drive and rallied. RAILMASTER broke a step slow, recovered and advanced to a stalking position, chased outside a rival around the turn, took
 closer order near mid stretch, drifted in and faded. TRUE CAT saved ground chasing the pace, angled out near mid stretch but lacked a solid bid. BUFF'S
 EYE VIEW saved ground off the pace, shifted out in the drive and had a mild kick. SIMPSON eased back between rivals early, was under pressure mid turn,
 swung out and had belated action. CYCLOBOMB , four wide early, chased three wide around the turn and tired. IF ONLY I COULD , up close early on,
 rated back between rivals nearing the turn, raced four wide past the three eighths and gave way.
