 Footnotes
 MISS COBBLESTONE was unhurried along the inside, angled out to commence her rally, looped into the stretch five wide, drew even inside the furlong
 marker, was brushed nearing the wire when JO JO'S WINE came out, but dug in and was fully extended to prove narrowly best. JO JO'S WINE tracked the
 pace between horses, launched a bold bid entering the stretch, forged command and kicked on well, was collared a furlong out, came out a bit and brushed
 MISS COBBLESTONE in the final yards and was unable to resist that one. TWIRL GIRL was allowed to settle, advanced between horses, tipped out
 entering the stretch and continued on willingly to earn the minor award. MIZZ TUTU was allowed to settle, came five wide and improved position.
 DOGGERWINII was squeezed at the start, rushed to the lead along the inside, contested the issue to the final furlong and gave in. AWESOME MUSIC was
 close up three wide through the turn and tired. BIG RED SEVEN contended along the inside but lacked a response when called upon.

 Footnotes
 FORT FORTITUDE prompted the pace three wide, took over at will nearing the furlong marker and quickly drew away. ATHLETIC TEMPER was away
 alertly, set the pace along the inside, was unable to go on with the winner but kept on well to prove the best of the rest. GASAWAY was unhurried along the
 inside, shifted out entering the stretch and rallied between horses. TIZ TOO MUCH pulled between horses, leveled into stride on the turn, came four wide to
 make a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive. BIG E lunged at the start, rushed up along the inside, but came up empty entering the lane and faded.
 TWINSANITY was allowed to settle, came six wide but failed to make headway. TIZ FUNNY contended three wide through the turn and tired.

 Footnotes
 BOXING GLOVE set the pressured pace along the inside, shook clear entering the stretch, was kept to task and held sway. SPINNING SERVE was
 unhurried off of the inside, wheeled out entering the stretch, kicked on well but failed to menace the winner. SOMETHING BIRD was forwardly placed along
 the inside, was caught in tight and checked hard near the seven-sixteenths pole, shifted out and came again between horses to earn the show. DUBBY
 DUBBIE contended between rivals, angled in entering the stretch, offered a mild bid but lacked the needed late response. DALAMAN settled in hand,
 ranged up five wide through the turn, but flattened in the final furlong. CRAZY IVAN prompted the pace three wide to the eighth pole and tired. FIGHTING
 FOR GRACE broke slow and passed only the tiring ones. TROOPER was hustled along off of the inside through the turn and tired. ORBIT EARTH broke
 slow and was never a factor. PEGASUS MOON was close up toward the inside, came in a bit entering the turn, was within reach for a half and stopped.

 MISS MO MENTUM settled in hand along the inside, swung six wide entering the stretch, quickened once uncovered, engulfed the leaders and quickly
 cleared. GENTLE RULER attended the pace off of the inside, forged a narrow lead with a furlong to run, kept on well but was unable to go on with the
 winner. TRACK ROSE settled saving ground, got through to make her bid, shifted out and kept on well between runners. AMERICA'S TALE set the pace
 along the inside to the final furlong and gave in. SAHARA BREEZE was unhurried into stride, tucked in to save ground, got through and improved position.
 TROPICAL WAVE settled between horses in mid pack and went evenly. EMMPORT contended four wide to the stretch and tired. QUEENARDINI was close
 up three wide for six furlongs and wilted. SAINTLY CRY was allowed to settle, moved up between horses on the second turn, but came up empty entering
 the stretch and faded. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES was hammered at the start and showed little thereafter. HEAVEN BOUND was through after a half.

 Footnotes
 SCATMEIFUCAN stalked the pace three, launched a bold bid entering the stretch, came to levels with a furlong to run, fought on doggedly and finished on
 even terms with LIKE A HAINT for the victory. LIKE A HAINT set the pressured pace along the inside, battled gamely through a prolonged drive and
 stubbornly held on to halve the top spot. RADIANTRITHYM attended the pace along the inside, shifted out and kept on willingly to earn the show. RACEY
 REECEY pressed the pace three wide to the stretch and weakened. BILL'S WEALTHYGIRL was fractious in the gate, hopped at the start, tucked in and
 finished with a mild improvement. HEAVENLY DAZE broke slow, was unhurried, came six wide but failed to threaten. NATCHEZ PASS was allowed to
 settle five wide and failed to make headway. ADA LOVELACE settled off of the inside but lacked a response when called upon.

 QUIP set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed a furlong out, fought back and was all out to narrowly prevail. CROSSWALK dueled two wide,
 poked his head in front a furlong out, battled on gamely but was unable to best the determined winner. PAYNE stalked the pace, came four wide to make his
 bid, kept on well but settled for the minor award. SOURDOUGH settled in hand, moved up through the turn, came five wide but flattened in the final furlong.
 ENJOY THE JOURNEY was forwardly placed along the inside to the stretch and tired. BEST OF GREELEY settled along the inside, angled out entering the
 stretch but failed to make headway. RIDE A COMET was fractious in the gate, was allowed to settle, finished with a mild rally but failed to threaten.
 PRESIDIO broke slow, settled along the inside and was never a factor. ETERNAL FORCE contended five wide, but came up empty leaving the turn and
 dropped out. KENTUCKY CLUB showed little. TWIN FARMS was close up four wide for a half and dropped out. DRY MARTINI contended between horses,
 but stopped leaving the turn and faded fast.
