 DONTOUCHTHATDIAL settled at the rear early, began to improve past the five furlong pole, rallied through horses on the turn, came three wide into the
 lane, led approaching the furlong pole and was ridden clear. LOGI tracked the leading trio, continued to give chase in the two path on the turn, made an
 inside bid into the lane, led at the three sixteenths, was headed by the winner near the furlong mark and kept on inside while no match. THIRSTY
 COWGIRL settled near the rear, was relegated to last when DONTOUCHTHATDIAL passed near the nine sixteenths, was pushed along in the two to three
 path on the turn, and rallied mildly in the lane. AMAZING ANNIE set a pressured pace inside horses, edged to a clear lead near the five sixteenths, went to
 a drive in upper stretch, was headed at the three sixteenths, and flattened. PATSY J pressed the pace three wide, proved no match for the leader from the
 five sixteenths, and weakened under a drive in the lane. LILLET attended the pace between horses, began to lose ground from the three eighths, and was
 empty in the lane. ME TOO MO settled toward the rear, raced in the five to six path on the turn and made no bid.

 Footnotes
 MUSICAL INTEREST soon cleared, set the pace while saving ground on the turns, and held well clear despite drifting out late while kept to the task. LEE LA
 DEW settled near the rear, improved in the two to three path on the far turn, sustained her rally two wide down the lane, and got up for place near the wire.
 OFF TO THE BEACH stalked the pace inside of CAPTAIN CARNEGIE, continued in closest range of the pacesetter in the two path on the far turn, gave
 chase in the lane while no match, but lost the place in the final strides. HE'S THUNDER chased near the rear of midpack early, improved position inside
 foes down the backstretch, continued to gradually advance through the far turn, and ran evenly in the lane. REDS BEST chased two wide early, continued
 three wide midfield down the backstretch, chased in the six path around the far turn, and proved no threat while running evenly late. LOCAL HONEY chased
 inside of REDS BEST early, continued midfield between horses down the backstretch, shifted out approaching the half mile mark, raced in the five path
 around the far turn, began to flatten out past the three eighths, and was no factor in the lane. ROUL THE ICE trailed well off the rail early, continued to trail
 in the three path on the far turn, and made no bid despite being asked in the lane. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE stalked two wide, faded in the two to three path
 around the far turn, and had no more in the lane.

 Footnotes
 MAXIMUS IMAGE chased two wide toward the rear, was pushed along in the four path on the turn, swung out three wide into upper stretch and went to a
 drive, sustained a bid down the lane and led in the final fifty yards. POWER SONG soon led, took early pace pressure, dueled inside of JEGGYJEGGY
 around the turn and into the lane, wrested a clear lead in midstretch, drifted out and carried out JEGGYJEGGY, kept on but was caught in the final fifty
 yards. DOCTOR VICTOR chased toward the rear inside of MAXIMUS IMAGE early, waited while saving ground through the turn, swung three wide in upper
 stretch, began to rally, found his best stride in the final sixteenth of a mile, and gained to the wire. JEGGYJEGGY pressed two wide down the backstretch,
 dueled two wide on the turn, fought on under a drive in the lane, was carried out by POWER SONG drifting out, and flattened out late. ROLL CALL tracked
 the leading pair two wide early, continued to track in the three to four path on the far turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch, kept on with interest but was
 outfinished. PRUDENT HERO was a bit awkward into stride, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, began to rally and regained touch with the rest of
 the field in upper stretch, made belated improvement inside foes, switched two wide to pass the fading KEY VOYAGE near the sixteenth, and continued to
 gain to the wire. TAPNGO settled near the rear, raced two wide on the turn, and mustered no rally. KEY VOYAGE tracked the leading pair inside of ROLL
 CALL, weakened inside on the turn, and was no factor in the lane.

 Footnotes
 FORT RIDGE chased inside foes, continued in the two path on the turn, shifted out into upper stretch and had aim three wide on the leading line, shifted
 slightly inward and bulled through two wide between horses near the furlong mark, shook to the lead and held. SUMMER DISCO prompted the pace
 between horses, increased the pressure between horses past the half mile mark, came two wide into the lane while still between horses in the leading line,
 kept on gamely three wide after FORT RIDGE got through to his inside, but was narrowly outfinished by that foe. KYZAN prompted the pace three wide,
 encroached more closely on the leader past the half mile mark, swung four wide into the lane while still with the leading flight, and kept on doggedly to the
 wire. MATCH PLAY settled at the rear of a compact group, raced two wide in the rear flight into the turn, made a circling bid past the three eighths mark,
 fanned seven wide into the lane, chased on but lacked the needed final kick. SUPERSTAR LEO chased between horses early, settled to join the rear flight
 inside of MATCH PLAY near the seven sixteenths, raced in the three to four path around the bend, fanned five wide into the lane, kept on but did not find
 enough. PEACOCK MAN set a pressured pace inside foes, took stronger pace pressure around the turn, came into the lane under a drive inside horses, led
 narrowly to midstretch and weakened. VBREEZE chased three wide early, raced in the four to five path around the turn, came six wide into the stretch,
 faded past the quarter mile mark and was not persevered with late.

 HOPPESTRY set a pressured pace early, shook clear from the half mile mark, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, continued on an unchallenged lead
 into the lane and held driving. HEY HEY pressed between horses early, stalked in the four path on the turn, came into the lane between horses, lost second
 position in upper stretch, gained it back near the eighth pole, and chased on a clear second best. HOLYHOOT chased midpack inside of RAIN
 EXPRESSION, raced in the two to three path on the turn, rallied inside foes past the three eighths and came into the lane in range inside of horses, went to
 a drive approaching the furlong mark, could not hold second position but held clear for the show. HAL'S MISCHIEF was taken back to settle near the rear,
 raced in the two to three path on the turn, and proved best of the rest between horses. APPOLLOS BABY GIRL started slightly awkwardly, settled near the
 rear, raced in the four to five path on the turn, and lacked the needed kick in the lane. RAIN EXPRESSION chased two wide down the backstretch and
 around the turn, and proved empty under a drive in the final furlong. SASSY AND REGAL attended the pace three wide, stalked on the turn while still three
 wide, came into the lane three wide under a drive, and faded.

 VALIANT LADY tracked the leading pair, was urged in the five path on the turn, rallied three and then two wide in the lane, and got up in the final jumps.
 SUZ was sent for speed, set a pressured pace down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, shook clear in to the lane, kept on under
 pressure but was nailed near the wire. HIDE AND STREET chased inside of PARA VIVIR on the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, went to a drive
 inside horses in upper stretch, chased on with interest inside foes but proved no match for the top two in the final furlong. PARA VIVIR chased outside of
 HIDE AND STREET, continued two wide in the three path on the turn, kept on mildly three wide in the lane and proved best of the rest. MORETA was sent
 for pace, pressed outside of SUZ down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, proved no match for the leader past the quarter pole, and
 weakened. ROSIE BEAR settled two wide near the rear, offered a mild three wide bid on the turn, was driven into the lane, and could not sustain a
 threatening bid. HER WILD LIFESTYLE settled near the rear, saved ground through the turn and offered no rally. GOOD WISHES settled at the rear, raced

 Footnotes
 ANTRIM'S GIANT tracked the leading pair, shifted out and improved from the half mile mark, bid two wide on the far turn, led with three eighths of a mile
 remaining, cleared, and drew off while kept to the task. SMOKE 'N' GLOAT set the pace while keen early, carried a slim lead into the far turn in the two path,
 was headed by ANTRIM'S GIANT at the three eighths, chased on while no match but proved clearly second best. TRAVEL WEST came away well, settled
 back to chase toward the middle of a strung-out field, raced in the two to three path on the far turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch, and chased
 earnestly while no match. PISTOL BOX settled near the rear, raced in the three path on the far turn, and finished mildly past a tiring foe. MCHENRY settled
 at the rear, saved ground through the far turn, and lacked the needed rally. HALF OF MANHATTAN stalked the pace, saved ground through the second
 turn, began to lose ground from the three eighths, and was empty in the lane.

 Footnotes
 MORA VALLEY disputed the pace two wide early, inherited a clear lead hear the half mile mark, was confronted by LADY MAGNA on her inside
 approaching the five sixteenths, vied outside of her to the sixteenth pole, and edged clear late under a drive. LADY MAGNA chased inside foes early, made
 a sharp bid inside of MORA VALLEY near the five sixteenths, came into the stretch under a drive inside that foe, vied to the sixteenth mark, but was no
 match late. ELIZ'S HOPE settled at the rear, began to rally on the turn, split horses near the three eighths, sustained her bid into the lane, but proved no
 match for the top two. MINING FOR PEARLS chased between horses down the backstretch, settled back near the rear inside into the turn, swung three
 wide in upper stretch, and offered a mild rally to prove best of the rest. BE AUTHENTIC chased three wide down the backstretch and two to three wide on
 the turn, and kept on mildly four and then three wide in the lane while proving no threat to the leaders. REGAL STORM settled near the rear, chased three
 wide on the turn, came widest into the lane and lacked the needed kick. SUM SILVER tracked the leading pair two wide early, tracked in the four to five path
 on the turn, was no match from near the five sixteenths and weakened. BARBIELLO sent for speed early, disputed the pace inside to the half mile mark,
 dropped out of contention inside around the turn and was no further factor in the lane.
