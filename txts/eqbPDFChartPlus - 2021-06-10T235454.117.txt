 CLICKJAB well rated emerged off a loose leader on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch quickly closed from mid track edging up under a drive.
 GARRISON COMMANDER hustled out moved off on pace through the backside, held a solid lead on the far turn then was hooked from the outside nearing
 the eighth pole fighting back before ceding the issue late. BAKU DANCER tracked the pace through the far turn racing five wide down the stretch holding
 the others with an even finish. BULLET BANDIT slow early saved ground to upper stretch gaining then holding position. FULMER was never involved racing
 nine wide through the lane. PUGET SOUND hustled along four wide would tire. OVERCRITICIZED sent hard pressed early wilting after a half a mile.
