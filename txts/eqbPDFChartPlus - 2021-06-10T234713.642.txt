 Footnotes
 KISS ME CANDY hustled up early in the two-path to contest the pace inside SEEKING DUE TIME, shook that one off in upper stretch, and was kept to
 pressure to maintain the advantage. INDYGO RUN stayed in range three wide around the turn, finished well but could not seriously menace the winner.
 SEEKING DUE TIME dueled for command outside KISS ME CANDY for three furlongs, and was outfinished from there. PURE PASSION was outsprinted to
 the lane two wide, and did not threaten with an even finish. MISS BUCKETS raced three to four wide around the turn, and could not gain widest in the
 stretch. MYSTIC BELLE chased two wide for three furlongs and faded. SHARP'S MISSION trailed inside throughout.
