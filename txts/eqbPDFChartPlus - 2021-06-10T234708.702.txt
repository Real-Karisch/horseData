 Footnotes
 CALLIE CALIFORNIA cleared the lead just after the start, quickly widened to clear advantage, saved ground then roused for more in the far turn, had more
 in the tank and remained clear. INSIDE TRIP saved ground and rated in early stages, steadily advanced closer along inside running through the
 backstretch, launched bid for CALLIE CALIFORNIA in the final turn, was no match for eventual winner but continued with response driving along outside
 and captured place. TACO WAYNE'S SHOT raced in or near the back then moved up closer along the rail mid-way through backstretch, waited past the
 half mile marker then roused through along rail in the far turn, came out couple paths and edged late for place. MISS LOTUS FLOWER settled off the clear
 pacesetter, launched two wide bid in the far turn, kept on upper stretch then steadied while weakening in final furlong. FRECKLE DE FRECK saved ground
 in the first turn, raced three to four wide in the backstretch, flattened in the far turn and failed to move on in the lane. JUSTA JILL dropped to last after
 opening quarter, sent driving two wide out of the far turn to no avail.

 MEMORIZE raced inside and bit tight going by the half mile marker, cut the corner then switched out, moved out wider making FAITH FLYS AGAIN go
 wider then switched to right handed when approaching weakening pacesetter in deep stretch and drew clear. FAITH FLYS AGAIN angled in after the start,
 out-paced and switched to outside of leader, raced in tracking position then driving three wide upper stretch, carried wider by MEMORIZE while continuing
 to close on tiring leader and gain runner up spot. FIRST OFF cleared the lead and angled in from outside, set uncontested pace along inside, under strong
 right handed urging in the stretch, continued to try but had no kick in late reserve. NOT NICE steadied slightly when things tightened up in initial sixteenth, in
 steady pursuit of the top trio then finished five wide in final furlong, finished well clear over rest. WINNING GAME chased in contention then gaveway in the
 turn. GINGER RED steadied after the start and lacked response. JESSICA CLAY steadied after the start then dropped far back, eased to wire and walked
 off after the race.

 to gain place. LEROI'S GEM raced near the back then roused five wide in the far turn, gained position and under strong right handed drive upper stretch
 then finished evenly. GOING TO THE BEACH saved ground then made two wide move late backstretch, in tight, steadied then made rebid between rivals
 leaving far turn, kept along trying to hold share then steadied in deep stretch. WILD FORCE raced in the back then shifted out and roused upper stretch,
 failed to rally. OFFSHORE TRIP hung out and driving in contention racing six wide in far turn then faded in the lane. LITTLE CRISTIAN raced off the top
 two, kept along racing along rail in the final turn then retreated. CHASING THE STARS dueled in first turn, continued til quarter pole then dropped far back

 trhough the turn then edged away to clear command, wanting to lug in bit raced under strong left handed drive, drew off from the field, briefly came out
 couple paths then ridden out in final sixteenth. RAINFALL raced in contention under some hand rousing, roused four wide approaching the quarter pole,
 under strong ride but no match for winner, rider confident second place was wrapped up, rider stood up in deep stretch while COTTON TOOYAH continued
 to close, still held safe. COTTON TOOYAH angled in after the start and continued sit off early pace, hustled up in the turn and continued to gather some
 momentum on four wide run upper stretch, closed on runner up spot finishing well clear over rest. SILVER THREADS speed at the start, vied along inside
 into the turn, was no match when winner swept by then faded in the lane. DELTA BELLE raced in range, sent driving along the rail in the turn then came up
 empty in the lane. FLASHNDYNAMITE raced just off leader then vied along outside, was no match when winner drew by in the turn, had nothing left in the
 lane. SUPER DUPER GIRL raced off the pace then came under ride three furlongs from home but lacked response. APPEALING LALIBELA dropped back

 Footnotes
 RUMBAGO took the lead racing two wide in the first turn, set the uncontested pace then widened to clear advantage still unleashed in the far turn, came
 under a ride as lead on top began to shorten, came out wider a furlong out then raced noses apart with IRISH LETTERS nearing the wire and finished on
 equal terms for win. IRISH LETTERS was well rated racing mid-pack along outside, hustled up in the far turn then set down for the drive, closed on
 weakening leader, dug in gamely with ears pinned back, raced noses apart, looked like he got nose in front approaching wire but RUMBAGO inched nose
 back up and thry finished on equal terms for win. ROCKY STRANGE unhurried, raced in the back opening quarter then steadily advanced closer through far
 turn, kicked in when set down driving along outside top stretch, closed on late leader racing outside of IRISH LETTERS, raced in dead aim nearing wire just
 lacked final kick to prevail. COLIN A WINNER was restless in the gate then stalked through the backstretch, tapped along but responded evenly near three
 eighths pole, raced along outside under left handed drive out of the far turn, drifted in despite left handed drive, good response and moved into striking
 distance then yielded in final stages. MORE ILLUSIONS was keen wanting to go and forced to check sharply the duration of the first turn, saved ground
 then angled out in the far turn, under a ride racing two path a furlong out then failed to move on. DYNAMIC DANCER tracked the pacesetter, under a ride
 along the rail in the far turn then steadily weakened in the lane. BEACH TREASURE raced in range then failed to kick on when put to drive in the far turn.
 DON FAGER dropped to last after opening quarter. Run up distance unavailable

 Footnotes
 HIDDEN TO WIN tracked the leader then cleared the lead mid-way through the turn, set down driving in the lane and held firm. LUNA LUNITA raced up
 close along the rail then sat just off top pair, waited then given cue racing along rail at the quarter pole, angled out top stretch, solid bid for winner bit could
 not reach while second best. LOVING VALENTINA roused three to four wide in the turn then finished evenly in the lane. DREAMING OF ACA saved ground
 then raced two wide and briefly lacked path at the quarter pole, quickly gained clearance but failed to move on. ALICE'S GIRLS picked up the pace past the
 half, sent driving along outside in the turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. DIANA'S COMPRISE was sluggish at the start, trailed in the back, sent
 driving along rail in lane to no avail. TIUNA sped to the lead, collared by winner approaching mid-turn, quickly retreated.
