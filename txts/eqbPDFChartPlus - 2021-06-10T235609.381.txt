 Footnotes
 MUNDO MUTADDA in the second flight early off the inside, dropped to the inside to save some ground onto the backstretch, got through along the rail to
 take over entering the stretch, drew clear under pressure. MOON GUN void of early foot, asked along four wide into the far turn, five wide into the lane,
 finished willingly to be up for the place in the final strides. JAKE JOURDAN set the early place along the inside, got clear before a quarter, extended that
 advantage the next two furlongs, got out turning for home to allow the winner the inside, could not get back to that one in the drive, nipped late for the place.
 KIRA'S KING settled off the pace toward the inside, called on for some run into the final turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position.
 ZARKING saved ground while well off the pace, improved slightly into the lane, flattened out in the drive. KAPENTA closest to the leader early, began a
 steady fade after a half. CLOSING WAY broke alertly, vied early outside, continued in a forward position in the first turn, began a stead retreat before a half.
 L. A. HOSS trailed throughout in showing little.

 extended to put foe away, edged clear late. MIDNIGHT RULER slight hop start, moved up to duel inside, got clear before a half, brief breather into the far

 moved outside, four wide in the second turn when beginning to advance, continued a moderate gain to be getting to the runner up late. ZACKAROONEY
 hopped at the start, settled in the second flight, came up empty for the drive. ETRUSCAN lacked a response when called on for the drive. KING'S SHARE

 REALMENTE CALMADA away in good order, dueled early inside, rated while narrowly showing the way up the backstretch, got clear in the second turn,
 extended that advantage through the stretch while being kept to task. DEEP END void of speed, began to move far turn, rallied five wide into the lane,
 finished willingly to be clear for the place. ZARB'S WINNIE lacked early foot, began a steady gain before a half, closest to the winner into the lane, flattened
 out in the late going to be caught for the second spot. MOVIE DATE off step slow, back early, saved ground, improved position without posing a serious
 threat. ROWDY N PEARLS settled off the pace while racing outside, five down to four wide first turn, continued one paced in lacking a late response. DEEZ
 JITTERBUG was also never dangerous. MISSBONQUIQUI forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the drive. AZURALEE dueled up front
 early outside the winner and stopped. CARSON'S COWGIRL was finished early, far back in trailing home.

 Footnotes
 MY RUSTON void of early foot while off the inside, circled boldly into contention while four wide through the final turn, challenged turning for home, quickly
 well clear. LATE APPOINTMENT within striking distance while saving ground, moved out a bit to overtake a tiring leader entering the stretch after already
 losing contact with the winner, no match for that foe in the drive, clearly second best. WILD LIL REBEL lacked speed for a half, came four wide out of the
 final turn, staged a willingly rally to annex the show while too late for the top two. CLASSY AND RICH evenly paced off the inside, four wide exiting the final
 turn, continued one paced to the wire. ETOILE D'ALLIE sprinted clear soon after the start, maintained a considerable advantage in the run up the
 backstretch, caved in readily when confronted turning for home. UNVEIL dropped back, saved some ground, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a
 threat. PURE TSU TSU closest to the leader for a half, stopped. SEPTENNIAL gave way after a half.

 Footnotes
 PRESSING LUCK broke with the leaders, dueled up front along the inside, disposed of the other speed by four furlongs, remained clear in the drive under
 steady handling. VOX POPULI off a step slow, raced well back, rallied four wide through the final turn, finished with good energy to be in time for the place,
 no match for the winner. REYDELL settled of the pace while saving some ground, advanced into the lane, bid for the place, outfinished for that position
 while also not a threat to the winner. STAR TIME dueled outside the winner for three furlongs, gradually faded to lose a couple of spot through the lane. BIG
 YANKEE went evenly paced while racing outside. OVERKNIGHT settled off the pace, also lacked a response in the drive. R. V.'S EXPRESS in the second
 group early while saving some ground, two path the middle half, had nothing for the drive. THEBOYZSPARK remained always back. ALY'S
 GRASSHOPPER forwardly placed early, staged a steady retreat. SACRED SAGA in some traffic early while off the pace, was finished before a half.

 KISS MY BLING broke sharp, clear out of the chute, continued to show the way by daylight into the turn, not threatened in the drive while being kept to task.
 BUBBLE TIME broke with the winner outside that one, chased that rival through the turn while off the inside, roused for the drive, no match, clearly second
 best. C R FAST NITELITE lacked early foot, staged a mild rally to finish best of the rest, no match for the top two. BREEZY SONG closest to the top two for
 a half in the three path, came up empty for the drive. FLASHY ATTITUDE lacked a response from well back. I B SWEET evenly paced while well wide, five
 wide out of the turn, tired in the drive. VALID INFLUENCE remained always back.

 Footnotes
 FIDDLERS FAREWELL back off the pace early, advanced four wide turn, took over turning into the stretch, clear when straightened for home, enough left to
 last. NORTHWOODS CAT also lacked early foot, four wide gain into the lane, roused, late run, bid final strides, missed. NO GAME FOR SISSYS unhurried
 early, raced in some traffic turn, steered out a bit for room into the stretch, displayed some mild late interest to improve position. CLASSIC GREELEY void of
 speed, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, improved position, no real threat. SKYLAS GOLD broke sharp, set a quick pace along
 the inside, faltered when confronted by the winner exiting the turn. BACK IN BUSINESS within striking distance for a half, had little left for the drive.
 GABANATOR fractious in the gate then was bothered at the start, remained back. RASCAL fractious in the gate, off a step slow, trailed most of the way.
 GARDNER'S SONG bothered slightly at the start, chased a quick opening quarter and gave way. HALF PRIMED broke out, raced forwardly early, stopped.

 Footnotes
 CRICKADEE prompted the leader from the outside, challenged that one turning for home, put a head in front entering the stretch and drew out under
 pressure. PRINCESS ARWEN lacked speed while saving all the ground, continued inside second turn, shifted out in midstretch and managed a late surge
 to be up late for the place. SPIRIT OF ACADIANA away in good order, set the pace inside, briefly responded when headed by the winner into the lane,
 could not match strides with that one late, nipped in the final strides for the place spot. SKIPADEE DUE DA lacked speed outside, asked along far turn, four
 wide into the lane, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position slightly. STRISCETTA settled off the pace outside, failed to respond in the
 drive. LIBA hopped at the start, was finished early to trail home.

 Footnotes
 STAROOK reluctant to load, lacked speed in the early going, advanced outside, four wide in the second turn, late bid, held sway late under firm handling.
 JOEY B broke near the back, dueled early closest to the inside, shook clear after a half, continued to show the way into the lane, turned back a bit in upper
 stretch then gave ground grudgingly to the winner. EAGLE RISING closest to the two leaders, closer under pressure into the far turn, tried the runner up
 from the outside when straightened for home, denied. DONTTAKEITPERSONAL void of speed, steadily advanced to within striking distance after six
 furlongs, flattened out in the drive. MORDECAI MAN settled off the pace, moved out, moved a bit closer three wide in the second turn, finished up evenly in
 lacking a closing punch. ZARTAN off a step slow, trailed well back, displayed a moderate amount of late interest to improve position. QUICK ESCAPE raced
 outside and lacked a closing response. LORD REDDING broke on top, dueled up front off the inside and outside the runner up, chased that foe up the
 backstretch and into the far turn, gave way when the real running began. LOVE THAT BROWN settled in mid pack, had nothing for the drive. JUS RAD was
 finished early, far back.
