 EL GIGANTE, away slowly, moved forward in behind horses racing two wide, found room entering the stretch, dueled inside SKY HARBOR through late
 stretch and prevailed over that one. SKY HARBOR was in touch with the leaders going three wide into the turn, took the lead leaving that bend, dueled late
 but was outfinished. THE GHOST OF DIXIE advanced three then four wide on the turn to within striking distance but proved no match for the top two while
 preserving show honors. CHICO THE MAN raced near inside into the turn, angled five wide past the quarter pole and went evenly. TOUCH OF MISCHIEF
 came out into upper stretch and passed foes. DEFINITELY DYLAN came into upper stretch five wide and failed to rally. CYCLONE PATRON dueled outside
 then weakened. STYLING WINNING dueled inside, faded.

 MCEVE settled just off the early leaders before moving three to four wide on the turn, took command at the top of the stretch and quickly kicked clear.
 HUNKA BULL was bumped inward soon after the start, advanced outside coming to the quarter pole four wide, was no match for the winner but got up for
 second in late stretch. RED STORM RISING set the pace facing pressure from an inside rival then between foes late on the turn, weakened in the lane. LE
 GRANDE WHO was bumped around and squeezed back at the start, came out of the turn in the three path, hit her best stride late to narrowly miss show
 honors inside a rival. ROLLING STAR was bumped around at the break, raced three wide through the turn, shifted to the rail in upper stretch approaching
 the furlong grounds and improved some. NO SHAM HERE prompted the pace inside a rival then gave way in the stretch. DOUBLE STORM shifted six wide
 into upper stretch and improved position. FLYING PAST WHO switched out going four to five wide on the turn and failed to rally. ATTILA'S APOLLO chased
 the pace from outside and weakened. DANAS LOVE was shuffled back at the break and made no bids. MODJESKA HEAT failed to menace. CHICKIE
 QUEEN veered in and bumped a rival after the break, chased the leaders in behind, faded.

 CONQUEST MO MONEY was carried four wide into the first turn, settled mid-pack up the backstretch before moving three wide leaving the far turn, stuck a
 narrow lead in upper stretch then held off the challenge of OH SO REGAL, who tracked the long lead of the pace-setting CARLSON up the backstretch,
 moved in behind that rival and inside the aforementioned victor leaving the far turn, shifted to the rail for room nearing the furlong marker, was hard-ridden
 but could not get past. CARLSON set the pace establishing a long lead up the backstretch, came into the stretch in the two path and gave way. BURN
 BABY BURN settled toward the back off the inside, came into the stretch five wide and improved position. SPUNWITHPRIDE advanced inside rivals into
 and early on the far turn but could not sustain the effort thereafter. LATEST LEGEND eased back early and tucked in to save ground through the first turn,
 failed to make a bid. TIZ HOLY stalked the early pace three wide then faded. ALL NUGGETS was through early.

 the winner while preserving the place. GATHERING EVIDENCE moved clear soon after the start, faced challengers on the turn, weakened in late stretch.
 FM UNBRIDLED DREAM was within range going three then four wide on the turn, had no extra in late stretch. OH MERCY ME was ridden along

 Footnotes
 MAKER PAY raced outside off the pace going three then four wide on the turn, struck a narrow lead in upper stretch and just held. LOUMYLOVE settled at
 the rear, went four to five wide on the turn, steadily bid in the lane but missed. TRUST EMILY was just a bit fractious in the gate, in range going in the three
 path through the turn, in a bit tight behind and between foes in upper to mid-stretch, found room to bid inside the eventual winner late but missed.
 WESTERN BOUND set the pace in the clear, weakened in the stretch. HOMERS WHISKEY GAL tracked the early pacesetter racing near but just off the
 inside and had no late bid. MISS DOMESIUS raced in touch between foes up the backstretch but went evenly and had no bid. RUBYSLITTLEGEM was
 never a threat. RUBY ANN WHO was ridden along chasing inside but emptied out.
