 MISS AMADOR set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, angled in through the turn and weakened. CHEYENNE'S GALE was up close
 early, went three wide into the turn and faded. MISS JO JO raced in mid pack early, raced four wide into the turn and never fired. THOU SHALT RULE

 Footnotes
 INDYGO DAWN tracked the early pace, loomed seven wide through the turn, made a bid at the sixteenth pole, dueled with C C MANOR to the wire and
 prevailed for the win. C C MANOR set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, met the bid of the winner in late stretch, dueled with that rival
 and just missed for the win. URGRACEISENOUGH was up close early, raced between rivals and finished empty in the drive. ALMOSTEVENWITHEVAN
 was outrun early, circled eight wide through the turn and finished belatedly. MYONIA was taken back early, raced along the inside into the turn and offered
 no late rally. AMERICAN PROUD stumbled at the start, rushed to be close to the pace, went three wide into the turn and weakened. LOOKING FOR INFO
 was void of any early speed and passed tired rivals. MULBERRY chased the early pace and faded. RAGING AFFAIR was never a threat. DEVIL'S
 WILDCAT raced in mid pack and retreated.
