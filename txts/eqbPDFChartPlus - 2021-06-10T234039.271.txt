 Footnotes
 DEMANDS ATTENTION was away alertly, set the pace off of the inside, opened clear on the turn and drew away to score as much the best. PSYCHO CAT
 settled in hand, circled into the stretch four wide and was along in time to earn the place. BENNY COLORS vied for the lead along the inside to the stretch
 and weakened. IDEAL CITY pulled to contention between horses, loomed a danger leaving the turn, but faltered entering the stretch. JOEY B was slow into
 stride, lagged well back, angled out entering the stretch but failed to threaten. CATCRUZIN broke awkwardly and was never a factor. CORRECTAMUNDO
 broke outwardly, moved up four wide, but stopped after a half.

 Footnotes
 RADIANTRITHYM was close up along the inside, shifted out and forged command with five-sixteenths to run, opened clear entering the stretch, drifted out
 slightly in the drive and maintained a diminishing advantage. HEAVENLY DAZE broke slow, advanced along the inside, got through entering the stretch and
 was getting to the winner. NATIVE INDY stalked the pace four wide, launched her bid entering the stretch, was floated out further in the final furlong and
 flattened. MISS FRANK E was allowed to settle, came five wide and improved position. STARSHIP AQUARIUS contended between horses, but faltered
 leaving the turn and faded. GRANTASTICA opened clear to set the pace, was collared on the turn, and gave way readily once headed.

 ENCHANTERA settled in hand, tucked in to save ground through the turn, angled out entering the stretch and wore down SHARP ART in the final yards.
 SHARP ART broke slow, looped out five wide to make a bold bid, opened clear a furlong out, kept on well but was unable to resist the winner. SNOW
 LEOPARD came away a step slow, rushed to the lead along the inside, weakened during the drive but had enough left to hold the show. SONOMA CRUSH
 attended the pace along the inside, got through but lacked the needed late response. BLACK BEAR tracked three wide, drew even leaving the turn, but
 weakened between horses during the drive. CEEJAY'S MISTER contended between horses to the stretch and faded. PURELY GIVEN settled saving
 ground, shifted out entering the stretch but failed to make headway.

 I AM MISS BROWN attended the pace along the inside, shifted out to launch her bid, reeled in the leader and edged clear. DISONES PRETTY pulled to the
 fore along the inside, opened clear on the backstretch, was unable to resist the winner but stayed on to clearly prove the best of the rest. BALTIC STAR
 lagged well back, wheeled out entering the stretch, made a late rally but was left with too much to do. LADY MOLLY contended four wide, angled in a bit
 entering the stretch, but flattened between horses. BAYLYNN settled saving ground, got through but lacked the needed response. SEE THE BIRD failed to
 respond. MASKED TALENT disputed the pace three wide, came up empty on the second turn and dropped out. MARTHA ROSE contended four wide
 through the second turn and stopped.

 Footnotes
 GIOVANTE attended the pace along the inside, steadied inside the five-sixteenths pole, angled out for clear sailing entering the stretch, reeled in the
 leaders and edged clear. BUNZLAUER disputed the pace along the inside, fought on through a long drive, but was unable to go on with the winner. TY MAN
 contested the pace three wide, weakened during the drive but had enough left to hold the show. CAPTIVATED was unhurried along the inside, shifted out to
 commence his bid midway through the turn, and improved position. TORBA was allowed to settle, angled in to save ground, got through and finished with a
 mild rally. ROYAL GHOST was slow into stride, finished with a belated gain but failed to threaten. ON JOHN was close up five wide, but faltered leaving the
 turn and faded. YOU GO BOY contended off of the inside, angled out leaving the turn, but came up empty entering the stretch. HANSEN GONE WEST
 disputed the pace between horses through the turn and tired. STAR ON MY SHOES failed to respond. RED EYE VISION was forwardly placed between
 rivals four wide for a half and dropped out. PRIDEOFSEVENHEARTS was through early, dropped far back, eased to the wire but walked off.
