 ALL THE BEST stalked the pace through the backside rallying to engage on the far turn, shook clear inside in upper stretch holding off a trio of rivals late.
 SHELTOWEE'S VELVET bobbled slightly at the break, unhurried to the half responded on the far turn angling between horses in mid stretch vying gamely
 at the end. LOVE CHILD hustled out set a pressured pace to the far turn, collared there would cede the lead in upper stretch digging deep in the two path to
 stay on to the end. CZRAINA MARIA tracked evenly then faded off into upper stretch, regrouped on the outside bidding willingly four deep in the closing
 yards. SWEET BAYTOWN prompted the early pace then faded on the far turn. BECAUSESHECANDOIT was hustled to bid on the backside then leveled off
 on the far turn.
