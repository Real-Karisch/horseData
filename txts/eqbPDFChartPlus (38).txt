 Footnotes
 HIDE THE CANDY set the pace four path, drifted out through stretch while drawing away under a drive. TRUE WISDOM chased racing in the five path but
 was no match through the stretch. STREET OFFICER, three wide in second flight, dropped back through the stretch. FREE FOR NOTHING saved ground
 while forwardly placed then tired. MANTLE, very wide, failed to be a serious threat. KEEPING THE PEACE, outside and just off the early pace, gave way
 leaving the turn. EBO STRONG, three wide, failed to be a serious threat. ALMOST PERFECT broke slowly then showed little. QUICK LEARNER, between
 foes, was never a serious threat. VIZCAINO reared in the gate, broke slowly then showed nothing.

 Footnotes
 LAY IT ON THE LINE stalked from the five path, took the lead in early stretch, drifted out badly and won under strong handling. AIR QUALITY, jostled
 leaving the gate, split rivals on the turn, drifted out through stretch and closed well. BUILT BETTER saved ground while never far back, also drifted out into
 and through stretch and was too late. RULES steadied after the start, moved up between foes then had no late kick. LAWYER ROY, between rivals setting
 the early pace, was left with the rail then tired. SCOOBYDOOPAPA was very wide on the turn, angled in and split rivals through stretch. RISING STORM,
 very wide while just off the early pace, tired. PAPPA ROX, between foes, failed to menace. COMMUNITY COURT, just off the rail and just off the early
 pace, tired. SR.'S THRILL dueled for command between foes before tiring. KING VICTORIA, just off the rail, failed to menace. RACEHORSEINARED came
 in leaving the gate then showed little.

 Footnotes
 KRISSYS MANICURE, two wide second flight, went three wide near quarter pole, took lead with a little more than a furlong to run and edged away. SALLY
 O'PRADO raced wide on the turn, moved between foes into stretch then angled in and gained place. PINKOUT raced very wide and finished with good
 energy. LOVE ON FIRE, inside winner early, remained a factor to deep stretch then weakened. DI, in the five path, failed to be a serious threat. SPANKY,
 hustled to the lead along the rail, drifted out through stretch and faded. COUPELLA, wide and just off the pace, dropped back. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT
 saved ground and had only brief speed. SPECIAL RISK raced wide and showed little. LENDAR, just off the rail and just off the early pace, tired. COLD
 HEARTED PEARL was well placed inside, and was finished after a half. MRS. CREWS, five wide, was in a bit tight on the backstretch and gave way.
