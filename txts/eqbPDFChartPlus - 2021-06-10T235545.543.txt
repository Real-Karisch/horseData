 Footnotes
 VALIANT FLAME stalked the pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then rallied inside of ROYAL ALEXEI, caught that one leaving the furlong
 grounds and edged clear driving. ROYAL ALEXEI set the pace to the stretch, responded to mid stretch but left room for the winner inside, was collared then
 held second. A TOAST TO YOU pressed the runnerup two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly. GOTHAM SKY chased the
 pace to the turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch but also lacked the needed late response. STORM FASHION trailed to the turn, was asked three
 wide then had to swing out five deep into the stretch and showed a little interest late.

 MANY LIGHTS pressed the pace to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, collared MAMA'S SECRETSTORM in mid stretch then edged away under steady
 urging. MAMA'S SECRETSTORM broke alertly and set all the pace to the stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch and was tiring late but held
 second. EXCENTRA got outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but was gaining for second. FIRST SICILIAN
 was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. WILDCARD DEB had no speed, was three wide on the turn
 but did not threaten. KODIANNE also had no speed, was inside WILDCARD DEB to the stretch and also was never a factor. ART OF GOLD chased the
 pace from the rail to the stretch then stopped.

 STREET LAD set the pace two wide to the stretch then responded when set down, kicked clear and was under steady urging to the line. UBER STAR was
 four wide while stalking the winner to the second turn, tried to make a bid three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch but dug in late to save
 the place. ENGRAM was settled to the half, raced three wide on the second turn, was no threat to the winner while gaining late on UBER STAR. CAPE
 NELO tracked the pace to the second turn then saved ground but gave way. FANTASTIC ARAGORN pressed the pace to the second turn, was outkicked to
 the stretch and gave out. LULLABY'S ORPHAN had no speed and was never a threat. SOUTHERN SPRING gave a dull effort.
