 Footnotes
 STRAIGHT SHOOTER, brushed in the opening stages while being urged to dispute the pace inside a rival racing to the turn, continued to press the issue to
 upper stretch, shifted out entering the lane while gaining a clear advantage and was kept to firm right, then left handed pressure to widen the margin to the
 wire. BIG AL angled inwards sharply brushing the eventual winner while being urged to terms forcing the pace outside that rival racing into the turn, dueled
 for command to upper stretch but proved no match late while just holding a rival for the place honors. SUPERMANS CAPE tracked the leaders outside a
 rival in second flight, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and continued evenly in late stages. PARTY ON DUDE tracked the leaders along the
 inside from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, saved ground to race nearest the rail into upper stretch but steadily faded in late stages.

 Footnotes
 ASHA, bumped at the start, was righted, then angled to the inside in the opening stages to track off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted out nearing
 upper stretch steadily gathering momentum, split foes in upper stretch, then shifted outside the leader leaving the furlong marker to wrest the advantage and
 kick clear in time under firm handling. LAST SURPRIZE broke slowly, then was cut off at the start, settled last racing to the turn, switched out racing into
 upper stretch splitting rivals, then shifted four wide in late stages while finishing with interest to prevail for the place honors on the wire. DANEIRA tracked off
 the second flight between foes racing into the turn, split rivals following the eventual winner's path into upper stretch, then altered course to the rail when
 losing her path to a rival in late stages while being just outfinished for second. ROSIE BEAR, urged to dispute the pace along the rail from the outset into the
 turn, edged clear into upper stretch, shifted out in late stages while being roused to resist the eventual winner but gave out in the final sixteenth. STARIA
 PEACH joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the issue into upper stretch and gave way. TWILIGHT WARRIOR tracked the leaders
 outside a rival as part of the second flight racing three deep into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. MONGOLIAN TIME, swerved out sharply at the start
 crossing over the path of LAST SURPRIZE while bumping the eventual winner, was quickly righted, then hustled between foes to dispute the pace into the
 turn and emptied out nearing the lane.

 LITTLE MIGHTY MAN, unhurried in the opening stages racing just off the inside as part of the last flight into the turn, gathered momentum while angling out
 five wide racing into upper stretch and produced a sustained late response to collar the pacesetter and wrest a clear advantage in time under firm handling.
 HERE COMES KYLE, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, widened the advantage midway through
 the bend, held sway past midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. BOLD FRIENDS tracked just off the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight
 racing into the bend and continued in that path to late stages while making some mild progress. CUPBOARD, urged to a forward placing along the rail
 prompting the pacesetter in the opening stages, tracked off that foe inside foes on the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, then altered course to the inside late
 but steadily weakened in late stages. OUT OF HYDEING tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight racing to the turn, continued in that

 THATS MYBUDDY BOY, bumped at the start, angled to the inside early tracking the first flight racing into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch to bid for
 command in tandem with several rivals three deep between foes, wrested a narrow advantage leaving midstretch and edged forward under firm
 encouragement. MY CURBY, a bit reluctant to load in the gate, settled last while angling inwards a bit racing to the turn, angled out to race six wide in upper
 stretch and found his best stride late to edge a rival for the place honors. ROARIN MISSILE shied inwards at the start bumping the eventual winner, was
 collected to track just off the second flight in early stages, shifted three wide on the turn commencing his advance, was urged to challenge while angling five
 wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick in the final sixteenth. GEORGIE MY BOY, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the
 outset racing into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and weakened in late stages. WAY tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening
 quarter, continued between foes on the turn, was fanned four wide between rivals into upper stretch and faded in late stages. LEE'S LUCK ducked in at the
 start, was quickly righted, then urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch but faltered
 leaving the furlong marker. DR. CALAHAN settled off the second flight in early stages, raced wide into the turn and proved no threat.

 MR D'S WAY broke sharply, sped to the fore along the rail to dictate the pace on a narrow margin, was roused to repel a rival's challenge while shifting out
 racing through the stretch making some light contact with CRAFTY SPECTOR but grudgingly held that foe to the wire. The latter was urged to gain a
 forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, attended the pace to the far turn, was urged to challenge racing into upper stretch, continued in a protracted
 skirmish to late stages while being brushed late but was just outfinished. ALPHA BOY hopped at the start, was quickly righted to track just off the leaders
 outside a rival in the opening half, shifted three wide nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance, gained terms with the top pair midstretch but was
 outkicked. FLIGHT MISSION, reserved along the inside tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but
 had no rally. HE IS A ROADSTER switched outside rivals racing into the first turn tracking off the second flight, continued four wide through the far turn and
 steadily faded. MAXI'S TAXI tracked just off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, saved ground to upper stretch but came up empty in the drive.

 Footnotes
 ASTRAKHAN switched outside a rival racing into the first turn while securing a forward placing, pulled her way to the lead racing into the backstretch, shifted
 to the inside once gaining a clear margin, dictated terms while shifting out well off the rail racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm hand
 urging and a few left handed taps. LION LOVE broke awkwardly losing position to the field, tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch,
 continued under patient handling to the second turn, split foes just off the inside to secure the place honors racing past midstretch but couldn't gain terms
 with the winner. TANNAH'BLU, reserved last racing well off the inside to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the lane and displayed some late
 interest to edge a rival for a share. TURKMENISTAN angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved
 ground to upper stretch gaining some position but lacked the needed final kick. CASSIDY AVE tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight
 in the opening five furlongs, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and faded in the drive. PAULETTE sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside
 racing into the first turn, switched outside the pacesetter once losing the advantage near the half mile marker, continued in brief pursuit of the winner shifting
 out three deep nearing upper stretch but gave way approaching midstretch.

 SUZ was urged to secure the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, set the pace a bit off the rail racing through the turn, shifted out leaving
 midstretch while being roused left handed to turn back a challenge from MEEKA and held that foe on a safe margin to the end. The latter tracked the
 pacesetter three deep in second flight racing into the turn, continued with a steady advance in that path racing into upper stretch but proved only second
 best. SHE IS GORGEOUS was settled last in the opening stages while angling to the inside early, shifted off the inside nearing upper stretch, was
 momentarily caught in tight quarters between foes in upper stretch, then angled to the rail through the last furlong while continuing with interest to gain
 position to the end. NOOK settled outside a rival tracking well off the second flight racing to the turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and gained
 some position in an even effort. PERFECT PLUS, held up avoiding some traffic in the opening stages, tracked off the second flight near the inside racing
 into the turn, shifted out four wide entering upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. ACROBATIC ALLY was urged along nearest the rail prompting the
 pacesetter in the opening furlong, steadied a bit off that rival after the opening three sixteenths and faded from contention early. VIOLA MARIE, off slowly,
 shifted out sharply in the opening stages while being urged to gain position in the second flight, made brief progress between foes racing into the turn and
 gave way abruptly nearing upper stretch.

 SHARP MONEY, bumped lightly at the start, raced unhurried tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing five wide in the opening stages, was
 prompted to gain striking distance racing three deep between foes entering the turn, steadily moved to terms with the pacesetter in upper stretch, wrested a
 narrow advantage and maintained that margin to the end under firm right handed encouragement. HAMMERS THIRSTY broke sharply, was urged along the
 rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, went clear midway through the turn, was roused to resist the winner's challenge
 grudgingly to late stages but proved only second best. SNALLYGASTER broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, was righted to track the leaders four
 wide, then three wide between foes into the turn to upper stretch and continued with interest to close the gap on the top pair late. J Z'S LAST TRY settled
 along the rail in the opening stages, gathered some momentum while angling out splitting foes, then angling five wide through the stretch to make some
 belated progress. SACRAMENTO Q swerved out at the start, then raced wide through the backstretch, was prompted to advance with a sharp four wide
 move racing into the turn continuing in tandem with the eventual winner, drifted out markedly in upper stretch and quickly came up empty. ROYAL BANK
 tracked the pace between foes near the inside, then along the rail racing into the turn and soon emptied out. TWO NEPHEWS tracked the leaders three
 deep between foes in second flight in the opening stages but gave way into upper stretch. UNCLE PAPPY, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off
 the pacesetter in the opening quarter, emptied out early
