 EXPLOSIVE SPY stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the home turn, found room along the rail in early stretch, took control at the eighth pole,
 drifted out late and edged clear for the win. HENNESSY EXPRESS set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail, through the backstretch, went three wide
 into the second turn, couldn't hold off the winner and was clearly second best. DESERT STEPPER chased the early pace, went four wide into the second
 turn and flattened out in the drive. MCAWAY was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals into the home turn and weakened through the stretch. PINK
 CADILLAC was unhurried early, saved ground into second turn and offered no late rally. BALLINOUTTACONTROL was up close early, advanced six wide
 into the second turn and faded. SIPPIN was void of any early speed, raced along the inside into the home turn, angled out in early stretch and never fired.
 RHYTHM'N SONG raced in mid pack early, circled eight wide through the second turn and was empty late. TO SATISFY YOU was taken back early and

 THUNDER DOME was up close early, went four wide into the second turn, took control at the quarter pole, met the bid of GO FOR A STROLL in mid
 stretch, dueled with that rival, drifted out late and prevailed for the win. GO FOR A STROLL was void of any early speed, saved ground into the home turn,
 angled out in early stretch, was gaining late, made a bid on the winner at the eighth pole, dueled to the wire and just missed for the win. HUTE was
 unhurried early, circled nine wide through the second turn and was along for the show position. RED ZENON was up close early, was forced out eight wide
 through the second turn, angled towards the inside and was empty late. HUSH'S STORM was outrun early, advanced between rivals into the home turn and

 went three wide into the second turn and flattened out in the drive. GOLD BOUNDRY set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the home turn
 and weakened. STREAKS BRO tracked the early pace, went eight wide into the second turn and was empty late. PER NMRC RULING #2019-SUN-30 ON
