 Footnotes
 MIDNIGHT LOU settled off the leaders early, raced four-wide through the turn, drifted in nearing the eighth pole, was straightened away, wore down FLY
 HIGH GARY in the closing yard to be going away late, was unsaddled on the back-stretch and vanned off. FLY HIGH GARY was away in good order to
 press the pace of CRUISER BLUE while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the five-sixteenths pole, quickly opened a clear lead,
 increased that margin and yielded to the winner late. BANQUE DRAUGHT was reserved just off the leaders early, raced three-wide through the turn,
 reached a striking position with a furlong to run but failed to gain late. SEVENTEENTHIRTYATE was off a step slow then hustled along to race off the
 leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with some late run. MYT FINE was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn,
 reached a contending position in mid-stretch but lacked the needed closing response. PARKER'S ADVENTURE showed no early speed, checked nearing
 three-eighths marker, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. CRUISER BLUE set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going
 a half.

 Footnotes
 REGAZZE CAT broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards.
 CRIMSON WARLOCK dueled for the lead from off the rail, stayed on in the drive and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. LOTS OF PRAYERS was
 reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, reached the fore with a furlong to run and gave way through the final sixteenth.
 CAUSE I'M BAD showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and again in mid-stretch and finished with a belated
 bid. CALCULATED CHAOS lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out with a furlong to run
 and finished with some energy. ABEJA was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. VALID KEIKI was fractious at the
 gate, away alertly, dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

 KINGS COURT raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths marker and drew off. TROOP
 SHIP set a pressured pace from off the rail, yielded to the winner into the stretch but held on well to save the place. SEEKING A MYSTERY pressed the
 pace of TROOP SHIP while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid in tandem with the winner but could not match strides with that rival in the drive.
 GEORGE'S MAIN MAN hopped at the start, settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and lacked the needed late response. MR.
 BRANCHING OUT broke sharply to chase the pace of TROOP SHIP while racing four-wide, steadied in mid-stretch and gave way. BRASS PEAR lacked
 early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. OUR POWER SURGE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did

 Footnotes
 MR. TAKAHASHI was away in good order to press the pace of HARD SLIDER while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
 five-sixteenths marker and drew off with complete authority. STRAIGHT BOURBON was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders from between foes,
 advanced three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished willingly. SOLEMNLY SWEAR was bumped at the break, raced
 unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with late energy. MAJESTIC KITTEN chased the leaders
 while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. HARD SLIDER broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going a half.

 WINE AT NINE stumbled at the start, recovered quickly, rushed to the lead, set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the
 three-eighths pole and drew off through the lane as the handiest of winners. ITALIAN WARRIOR was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained
 inside for the drive, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. ATYPIQUE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out
 into the stretch and finished with some late run. HEROES FOR GHOSTS was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide
 and weakened through the final furlong. MY BEST BET lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. WHERE'S MY VOUCHER was
 forwardly placed early, raced three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.
