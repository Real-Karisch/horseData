 Footnotes
 FEE WAIVER tracked three wide to far turn, bid past the quarter pole, took over in the stretch and lasted to the wire. WILKO FREEWAY had good position
 on rail, caught in tight three eighths pole, angled out for clear run far turn, rallied well and missed at the wire and might have been best today. SPANISH
 ARMADA no speed to the stretch off rail, split horses past the eighth pole late for show. GOODZAPPER pressed leader to deep stretch, stayed on well wile
 game. KENTUCKY KITTEN raced widest first turn, wide again into stretch with no gain while losing all the ground throughout. SAY HEY KID pressed pace
 between horses but was through after a half. BULLET BANDIT never a factor while widest into far turn and stretch. AMERICAN SPARROW never far back
 for three quarters but faded thereafter. TIZ COLD showed good speed to set pace to the half and gave way readeily from inside.

 OUR DREAM rushed to take over and widened at every call while in a steady drive in the final furlong. TRUE BLUE DIAMOND no speed outside, floated six
 wide in the stretch to get the place spot. LOVE TOTEM unhurried to the stretch, moved up close to rail for third while never a threat. OBVIOUS TWO took
 up the chase of the winner to deep stretch but was used up and empty through the final sixteenth. NAVAL COMMISSION flashed brief speed inside but
 gave way quickly inside. PRETTY PENNY PADDY raced evenly to the stretch with nothing left and gave way. SONGANDAPARTY never a factor at any
 call. TOOTHER BELLE was slow early and never menaced while far back. CYCLONE BETTY was through early while very wide into the stretch.

 HOPES ANGEL unhurried to the turn, rallied wide through the lane to catch leader at the wire. GRADUATION GIFT had good speed outside, cleared off, led
 to the final jump in a good effort while best of the rest. OHIO SILVER checked hard soon after the start, angled out into the turn and finished well too late.
 SHEZA FINE JUSTICE darted to the inside soon after the break and ran on late to complete the super. TEAM HALO had a slow start, far back to the
 stretch, rallied to split horses late and moved up. TIMEFADESTHEPAGES good inside speed but faded in the stretch run. SINCERE DEVOTION chased
 pace to quarter pole and gave way in the final furlong. JEZABEL'S CHARM was never a threat while wide into the stretch. THUNDER MAY show brief
 speed but stopped readily after the half. CHANSON D'AMOUR showed little. PYRITE SLEW was through early and dropped back quickly inside.

 FINEST well placed, with a wide run next to winner out of the turn and dueled through the stretch but was outfinisned in a good effort. JOCANDY had good
 position to the turn, hooked in a three way battle in the drive but could not go on with the top pair and settled for the show spot. HUNDRED ACROSS
