 BEACH MODE pressed the pace of ONE LAST HIT while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid with MAGARITA MAN nearing the five-eighths marker,
 vied with that rival into the stretch, opened a clear margin and drew off as a handy winner. MAGARITA MAN was reserved just off the leaders while racing
 four-wide, moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid after going three furlongs, vied with that foe but was no match in the drive. ONE LAST HIT was
 away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, gave way to the winner after going three-eighths, stayed on in the drive but did not threaten.
 VICTOR VICTORIOUS was off slow, lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. FLATTER CAT settled off the
 leaders early, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. MIKE MAN'S BRO raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through
 the second turn and weakened. HARBOR BAR lacked early speed, raced far back after the opening quarter and was eased through the lane.

 HUGGY BEAR dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and was ridden out to the wire to be kept to task. GOLDEN
 COWBOY settled off the leaders from off the rail, angled out in mid-stretch, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with good late energy.
 SMOOTHEE LEE broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival through the final furlong and gave
 way late for the place. ZAIAH'S LIL RASCAL lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. UPSHIFT was away in good order to
 vie for the lead from between rivals, raced three-wide through the turn and gave way after going five-eighths. CHASETHECLOUDSAWAY was void of early
 foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. LIL' QUARTER CHUTE broke n, settled just off the leaders, veered out nearing the quarter and
 weakened in the drive. MAUI MARTINI lagged throughout.

 FEEL THE CHARGE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, drifted out through the lane
 and was ridden out. BERNETTE was away in good order to chase the winner from off the rail throughout, was no match for that foe in the drive but finished
 well to be clearly second best. CASSIDY COMMAND lacked early speed, checked nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out approaching the stretch and
 finished with a belated bid. COME ON COZZENE raced four-wide through the first turn, was void of early speed, advanced from off the rail through the turn,
 reached a contending position but lacked the needed closing response. KAIULANI chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going
 seven furlongs. KITTEN DE PERE raced off the pacesetters throughout and gradually weakened. CALL ME CINDERELLA was off slow, rushed to contend,
 weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane.

 Footnotes
 MIKE MAN'S GOLD was away in good order to stalk the pace of OZARK DAREDEVIL while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
 three-sixteenths pole and drew off with complete authority. BOTCH was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing
 the quarter, drifted out in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy when clear. OZARK DAREDEVIL sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while
 setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. DOCTOR BRUCE S. settled off the leaders early, raced four-wide through the turn and finished
 evenly in the drive. THERE'S NO DOUBT was bumped at the start, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. PARTY POOPER
 was void of early speed, was pulled up after the opening quarter and vanned off.
