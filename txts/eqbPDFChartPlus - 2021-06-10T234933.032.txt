 Footnotes
 ELIZABETH RULES set a pressured pace while three wide into the turn, drew clear at the quarter pole and was kept to task in the end. TOP TIARA chased
 the early pace while inside, saved ground on the turn then made a bid but was second best in the end. TIYA was settled then rallied four wide in the stretch
 but was no menace in the end. SLEW OF THE NIGHT chased the pace while three wide into the turn, was in a long drive but lacked a late response when
 needed. BELLE SUPREME pressed the early pace while two wide, was hard used then gave way. RODEO ROSIE raced two wide on the turn and was no
 threat. FAST CASS raced on the inside on the turn and no factor. MOLLIEGH K showed brief speed then dropped back entering the turn. EDNAS CAFE
 trailed throughout.
