 Footnotes
 GRAN TEPUY stalked two wide early, took over on the backside, showed the way on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and held on late.
 ATTACK ZONE stalked three wide, moved up on the far turn, rallied outside into the stretch, dug in gamely outside of GRAN TEPUY in the final furlong and
 battled to the end. MAN UPSTAIRS tracked along the inside, chased the leaders on the far turn, angled out and had no rally. CIRCLE AWAY was outrun.
 SILVER DUKE pulled in the early stages while setting the pace, dropped back on the backstretch and gave way on the far turn.
