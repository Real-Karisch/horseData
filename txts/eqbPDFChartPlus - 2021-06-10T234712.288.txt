 Footnotes
 DOX FOLLY was in the three path through the turns, chased the pace through the far turn, bid behind the runner-up in late turn, followed that one into the
 lane while angling into the four path, dueled through the final eighth and just inched up late. MEMPHISINMAY stalked the pace from the three path into the
 far turn, moved to challenge and take over from the pacesetter in late turn, came into the lead with a clear lead, drifted out a couple of paths when put under
 a drive, dueled with the winner through the final sixteenth and was denied. BAHNKE tracked the pace from along the inside through the far turn, came into
 the lane from the two path and lacked a bid. CATINATI was unhurried while in the two or three path through the far turn, swung into the lane from the five
 path while under a drive and showed some gain while not a threat. AYE SKIPPER set the pace from the two path into the far turn then gave way entering
 the lane.

 Footnotes
 MINI CHUNK set the pace on a clear lead from along the inside, entered the lane from the three path, was caught by the runner-up after straightening,
 dueled with that one through the final eighth and prevailed in a game effort. BLAZE A TRAIL chased the pace into the turn while in the three path, was
 bumped a bit off-stride near the three-eighths pole when another came out, continued with good energy into the lane, moved to near even terms with the
 winner outside the eighth pole then could not get past that one while clearly second best. HAY BO was near the rail through the turn while chasing the pace,
 continued in the three path into the lane and could not gain while finishing best of the others. FARMERS ONLY was along the inside through he turn and
 was never a threat. ASH MITTWOCH was bumped solidly at the start, raced in the three to the two path through the turn and was never a factor. GEORGIE
 was outrun throughout while near the rail. HOME FOREVER turned in a dull debut while racing in the two path. BUTTON BOX chased the pace into the turn
 while in the two path, bumped rival in mid-turn then gave way and was eased to the wire late.

 TWISTED MIRACLE was unhurried while in the three path, continued in a methodical manner through the turn, came four wide near the quarter pole,
 entered the lane from the six path, did not look like a contender outside the eighth pole then gained momentum nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with
 a rush while five wide to be up in time. DR SMOOTH was unhurried while in the two or three path, entered the lane three wide, gained momentum near the
 sixteenth pole, was moving to the lead in deep stretch when outfinished by the winner. MIKE THE MAN was unhurried down the backstretch while near the
 inside, entered the far turn while angling into the four path, advanced through the four path into late turn while gaining on the pacesetters, bid four wide into
 the lane, dueled three wide while straightening, gained the lead with an eighth to go then was outfinished from mid-track by the top two. SO CAUGHT UP IN
 U was in the three path through the far turn, bid three wide into the lane, dueled from between rivals while straightening then was still a serious contender
 then weakened late. SANTISTEBAN was in the two or three path into the far turn while well back, came into the lane from the four path and finished with
 good energy although too late. IN TEN CITY pressed the pace two wide from the outset, continued to duel into the lane, was still prominent with an eighth to
 go then yielded to the others. GLITTER CAT was in tight along the inside and checked in the first turn, moved into the four or five path through the far turn,
 came into the lane from the seven path and showed late energy. CLAUDE raced in mid-pack while in the two path, was asked for more in late turn and
 lacked a closing response. LEOTA LIGHTNING was never a factor while in the two path through the turns. SHATTERPROOF was outrun throughout while
 near the inside. FORTY WEST tracked the pace along the inside through the turn then faded through the lane. LIL DRUNK DEVIL set the pace along the
 inside from the outset, continued on the pace until late turn then retreated through the lane.

 Footnotes
 TRIPLE A stalked the pace inside, rallied at the quarter pole, was checked in the stretch in tight quarters, rallied between foes and was clear under mild
 urging. HAWAIIAN MEMORIES stalked the pace inside, angled three wide at the quarter pole, bid, then couldn't hold off the winner. BABES ON A BUDGET
 pressed the pace in the three path, then faded in the stretch. VONDA led inside, drew off on the backstretch, then gave way late. HOT N SWEET stalked
 the pace in the three path before giving way. YO CITY LADY pressed the pace between foes, then faded in the drive. LADY GAIA had no response. DERBY
 PRINCESS was not a factor.
