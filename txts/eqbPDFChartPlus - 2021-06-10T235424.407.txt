 driving. AFTERBURNER was bumped at the start, chased three wide, rallied outside in upper stretch and dug in gamely for second. MY BOY LENNY was a
 bit fractious prior to loading, then bumped at the start, showed good speed outside to set the pace, dug in gamely inside when challenged in the stretch and
 weakened in the final sixteenth. GO TO WIN broke inward, raced off the pace, went three wide at the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and had no
 rally. NICKIE'S PAPA chased inside and tired. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of AFTERBURNER against the winner was dismissed.
