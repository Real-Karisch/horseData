 WOODLAND WALK broke in front, set all the pace, shook clear in upper stretch along the inside and lasted under strong right handed urging.
 COINCIDENTALLY chased the winner along the rail for a half, angled outside that one entering the stretch, dug in late and just missed getting up in time.
 JAGUAR POZ trailed into the turn then passed tiring rivals along the inside. FRONTLINER stalked the pace two wide and was through after a half.
 QUALIFLY close up from the start, offered a mild bid four wide into the turn then came up empty. KEYED ON TOP had speed into the turn then gave way.

 CLEARWATER always within striking distance, circled rivals three wide on the turn, engaged the leader in upper stretch, drifted and got up in the final
 strides in the seven path. BLANCONIA away alertly and angled in, set the pace from the three path into the stretch, drifted out to the six path, set the
 balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. DREAMINOFJUSTICE trailed into the stretch then closed determinedly in the three path. CHASING THE
 BUCK was forced inward and in tight between rivals soon after the start, chased the pace two wide into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. UMAMI
 failed to menace. BROOK'S ON FIRE was also in tight between rivals at the start, pressed the pace along the rail into the turn, checked near mid turn and
 dropped out of it. NICE RIDE was no factor. SASSY ROSE had brief speed.

 determinedly and finished second best. CRIMSON CORN was hustled along, stalked the pace near the inside into the turn, shifted out four wide at the top
 of the stretch then finished evenly. I'LL HAVE A MILLER trailed down the backstretch, swung wide and closed a gap late six wide in the middle of the
 racetrack. PLAYERS HERO away alertly, set the pace under pressure into the stretch then was outfinished inside. DIRECT DECEIT broke slowly, altered
 course four wide nearing the furn, moved up a bit then came up empty. MARINESERGEANTJOHN pressed the pace three wide into the turn then folded.
