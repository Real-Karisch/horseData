 Footnotes
 MADAME ORBE , patiently rated, began his rally five deep entering the stretch, closed outside horses, gained the lead late and held on. PROSPERITY ,
 two wide behind horses leaving the far turn, swung outside in mid stretch and closed gamely. DON'T FIGHT , four deep around the first turn, stalked the
 pace, was well placed behind horses entering the stretch and had a mild move between rivals. STARLET LADY circled the far turn four wide, loomed boldly
 in mid stretch then flattened out. C'EST MARDI , between horses the far turn, steadied in traffic in upper stretch, swung outside in mid stretch and passed
 tired foes. QUICKPAY , three wide both turns, chased the pace and weakened late. CELESTIAL DREAM pulled her rider down the backstretch, prompted
 the pace two wide, sprinted clear in mid stretch then gave way. BO'S IMAGE stalked the pace inside horses, saved ground the far turn and gave way.
 LAUREL LADY was caught in close quarters along the rail mid way on the first turn. WILDCAT broke sluggishly and was outrun. MISS LORETTA set the
 pace along the rail and faltered. MAGICAL DANCER was outrun.

 Footnotes
 I LOVE YOU chased the pace three wide around the turn, gained the lead outside horses in mid stretch and drove clear. TWO SIXTYONE , lightly steadied
 when outrun for position leaving the backstretch, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. HENDAYA , jostled leaving the starting gate, swung
 outside in mid stretch and rallied. SEXYAMA bumped HENDAYA when bearing out at the break, swung wide in upper stretch and passed tired horses. JUDI
 BLUE EYES saved ground around the turn and was not a factor. SIPPING CHAMPAGNE was no factor. UMIGHTBEANEMPRESS gained the lead along
 the rail leaving the turn and gave way the final furlong. PASSION'S IMAGE bumped with HENDAYA leaving the starting gate then was not a factor. ONE
 FAT KAT sprinted to the early lead, raced in the two path between horses on the turn and gave way. MERRY MAID , along the rail on the turn, faltered. An
 objection by the trainer of TWO SIXTYONE against the winner for alleged interference near the half mile pole was not allowed.

 late. CURLINGTON , very wide the first turn, was used moving up five deep down the backstretch, circled the far turn five wide, raced a bit erratically late
 when tiring and just missed. LAW OF THE LAND worked between horses in the stretch, bumped with BYE BYE MELVIN near the sixteenth pole and bid
 late between rivals. HUSHED HIJINKS chased the pace two wide and weakened late. DEGAS , fractious in the starting gate, raced three wide on the far
 turn, was well positioned in mid stretch and weakened. BYE BYE MELVIN , four wide both turns, bumped with LAW OF THE LAND near the sixteenth pole
 then steadied behind horses in deep stretch. INVITATION ONLY stalked the pace inside horses and weakened. GONE HOME showed speed along the rail
 and weakened. PHANTOM DANCE was not a factor. HERO'S RETURN was outrun. SUMMER SOMEWHERE raced along the inner rail much of the trip
 and was not a factor. CREATED SPECIAL was outrun.

 Footnotes
 MORTAL STORM sprinted clear soon after the break, set the pace along the rail, was challenged in upper stretch, dueled through the lane, dug in
 tenaciously and got the bob. CAROLINA ICE stalked the pace racing near the rail, eased out to the three path near the three eighths pole, rallied outside
 and just missed. EYE OF THE WILDCAT stalked the pace, moved up outside the winner to challenge for the lead in upper stretch, dueled and just missed
 between the top pair. JANELLE DREAMS hopped slightly at the break, lacked speed, raced inside horses through the stretch and rallied. LET'S GO BABY
 lacked speed, swung to the five path at the head of the stretch and lacked a rally. NANA'S SHOES raced along the inner rail in the stretch and failed to be a
 factor. MY AUNT TILLIE saved ground on the far turn and weakened. HEY MABEL was outrun. VIBRANT SPIRIT , three wide the first turn, chased the
 pace four deep on the far turn and gave way. MOVE OVER HONEY , three wide the first turn, weakened.

 Footnotes
 PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY broke last, moved up along the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path approaching the
 stretch, gained the lead outside GRAND SKYLARK approaching the sixteenth pole and drew off. SIMONELA raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung to
 the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. GRAND SKYLARK set the pace along the rail and weakened in the drive. LADY ROZINA , three
 wide on the turn, chased the pace, weakened in mid stretch and her rider eased up near the sixteenth pole when appearing to misjudge the finish.
 TIZADOOZI circled the turn, was five deep entering the stretch and lacked a rally. FRIESING WATERS chased the pace two wide, gave way near the eighth
 pole and was eased late. TURKO TREAT never a factor, raced along the inner rail through the stretch. HAPPY LANTERN , four wide turning for home, gave
 way. IT'S A DOOZY , five deep on the turn, faltered.

 Footnotes
 GAS MONEY , four wide the first turn, remained well off the rail, angled in leaving the far turn, rallied between horses, up late. HUNT ME DOWN had a shoe
 fixed in the paddock, stalked the pace, moved up three wide leaving the far turn and finished gamely. CARK saved ground stalking the pace, swung wide in
 upper stretch and flattened out. BOURBON STREAK , four wide the far turn, rallied mildly. CAST THE LOT showed speed along the rail, disputed the pace
 and weakened. UP AGAINST IT , four deep the far turn, lacked the necessary rallied. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY raced along the inner rail much of the trip
 and was no factor. LITTLE BAY , four wide the first turn, was checked in tight quarters leaving the far turn. WATCHMENEIGHNEIGH disputed the pace two
 wide and gave way. TALENTED DR. B dropped back.
