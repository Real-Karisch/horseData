 COZZE KID broke a step slow but showed impressive speed to gain a clear lead and was in hand once on the turn, responded to very brief urging in the
 upper stretch and dew off well in hand. BIG CEAS was well placed from the two path but proved no match for the winner. THISONESFORJAMES lacked
 early speed, raced three wide on the turn and failed to be a factor. ENGLISH ROYALITY prompted the winner from the three path to the stretch and faded.
 LUCKY J GO broke alertly then steadily fell back.

 Footnotes
 JOHN PAUL'S BET broke in stride and prompted INDIAN BRUT for the lead, alternated with that rival throughout the stretch and held determinedly.
 PREACHER'S BLUFF was never far back, raced in the two path on the turn, rallied and loomed boldly late but could not get by the winner. DRINK TIL YOU
 DROP lagged early, circled four wide to the stretch and closed willingly. INDIAN BRUT dueled inside the winner throughout and gave way grudgingly. JURY
 settled early, raced in the three path on the turn and failed to respond. ON THE FENCE was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 PURIANO broke alertly but slipped back just off the lead, stalked from the rail into the stretch, remained inside to rally steadily, was up late to win going
 away. A NEW TREND stalked two wide to mid stretch then lacked the needed response. MOOSE ON THE LOOSE broke slow but quickly rushed to the
 lead, set the pace to mid stretch and gave way from just off the rail. BUCKBEAK saved ground to no avail. WHAT A HOTTY lacked early speed, raced four
 wide on the turn and did not rally. ROCK SLINGER settled, raced three wide to the stretch and came up empty. HILLBILLY ROCKSTAR showed little.

 Footnotes
 LIL' CHIEFTAIN was quickly in front and set all of the pace from the inside under good rating, was never seriously challenged and won driving. MONSAJEM
 PERVADE lagged early, raced three wide to the stretch and finished willing. NAP LAJOIE was unhurried early, circled rivals four wide into the lane and
 closed well. TIZ BUFF pressed the pace two wide and weakened. MAXX THE GIANT checked from the inside on the first turn, recovered to stalk to the
 stretch and faded. NIGHT'S WATCH was finished early.
