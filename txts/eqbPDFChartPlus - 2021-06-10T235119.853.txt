 Footnotes
 GOLDEN CANYON was up close early, went five wide into the turn, took control at the quarter pole and edged clear for the win. CREDIT MEMO set a
 pressured early pace, raced between rivals into the turn, was no match for the winner and finished second best. OH DEUTERONOMY was allowed to settle
 early, checked off heels into the turn and was along for the show placing. HEAT WAVE LADY was unhurried early, raced between rivals into the turn and
 offered no late rally. QUIN TO WIN was taken back early, went six wide into the turn and never fired. DINOS DA DADDY was not far back early, steadied
 into the turn and was no factor. CANT AFFORD NOT TO chased the early pace from the inside and tired. DANCE INTO DARK was taken back early, went
 far wide into the turn and was empty. BEAN TOWN BABE tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn and faded. DON'T TELL JAY was never a
 threat.
