 POLAR OUTBREAK engaged for the lead in the two path before a half mile to dispute the pace then gradually edged away in deep stretch. E J'S
 REVENGE vied for the lead from the outset and gave way in the final furlong. OFFENDER was fractious in the gate prior to the start then broke awkwardly,
 prompted the pace along the inside then weakened. SHOTMASTER could gain little in the drive. CHASING MY HALO chased then weakened. SO HOT
 failed to be a threat. BRITISH FIELDS tired. IRONBOUND was no factor.

 ELUSIVE found his best stride too late along the inside. PAPADOPALOUS lacked the needed rally. SAHARA GOAL didn't break alertly then failed to
 threaten. I WANDA WIN chased through the turn then tired. SIXBITS broke a step slowly then trailed.

 SMART AND TOUGH joined for command three wide, shook loose to open a long lead entering the stretch and then held on. GITIDONE, between rivals
 early, eased out on the turn and closed strongly. STRONG BREEZE bothered and took up leaving the gate, was outrun while in the four path, angled out
 wider in deep stretch and finished fast. SYNCHRONOUS saved ground while just off the pace, also angled out on turn but failed to sustain his bid. ROCKET
 MAN RICHIE saved ground disputing the pace before tiring. REST ASSURED failed to menace. TAMPA BAY BLUE came in leaving the gate, raced very
 wide and tired. SO VALOR, wide and just off the early pace, gave way. CASEY KEY dueled for command two wide and had little left. TROUBLE WITH
 GIRLS was in motion in the starting gate breaking slowly and then took up in tight soon after.

 YAKOV dueled three wide, took the lead on far turn, drifted out through stretch and drew off. POLICE ESCORT, between rivals vying for command, was no
 match for winner but battled gamely to regain place. RICHIE'S RICH, between rivals early, eased back in the opening furlong, moved out and took up chase
 but then flattened out. SCARLY CHARLY raced out from the rail, split rivals into stretch, drifted out and bumped with AIKEN PREP near mid stretch. AIKEN
 PREP raced outside, drifted in contributing to the bumping with SCARLY CHARLY. GREED IS GOOD failed to menace. WHISPERING FOREST saved
 ground and showed little. PARK AVENUE APPEAL was a bit antsy in the starting gate and it appeared that his head was turned to the right and he may
 have been in the grasp of the assistant starter momentarily, raced wide, moved in and failed to menace. SILVER DAGGER dueled for the lead along the rail
 then tired badly.
