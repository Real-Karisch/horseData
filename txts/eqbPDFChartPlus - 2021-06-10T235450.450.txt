 Footnotes
 TO BE OR NOT TO BE edged closer to the leaders already under a drive outside the quarter-pole, rallied steadily in the three-path and was along late
 outside rivals. TEMPLEMORE chased outside NOT NECESSARILY for six furlongs, moved inside turning for home and rallied on the rail to get up for
 second. NOT NECESSARILY bumped solidly with MAGNIFICENT MURACO at the start but was away alertly, set an even pace toward the inside, came
 into the stretch in the two-path, remained clear past the eighth-pole but was outkicked late from both flanks. AVANTE LIGHT raced three wide early, moved
 in to the two-path and could not gain. DOROTHY M lagged well back inside early, and passed only tired horses. MAGNIFICENT MURACO took the worst of
 a solid bump with NOT NECESSARILY at the start and was slow into stride, and failed to reach contention. BILETNIKOFF faded inside after a half-mile.

 I GOT THE BRAHMS vied for command early between horses, got floated out to the four-path dueling outside INDY'S QUICK IMAGE at the top of the
 stretch, and pulled clear from the latter through the last furlong. INDY'S QUICK IMAGE argued the pace inside two rivals up the backstretch, drifted to the
 three-path battling inside I GOT THE BRAHMS turning for home, and came up second best. MRMISTAKENIDENTITY contested the pace three wide early,
 and moved inside while dropping back around the turn. LIGHT AFFAIR sat just off the battling leaders heading to the turn, and began to fade after three

 MY LITTLE STORMY was slow away from the gate, began to take closer order three wide up the backstretch, challenged outside COMMUNITY WATCH
 turning for home, and wore that rival down leaving the furlong grounds. COMMUNITY WATCH gained command inside through a manageable first quarter,
 rated along in front to the stretch, dug in when confronted by MY LITTLE STORMY, could not contain that one but held for the place. LET'S GO BABY
 saved ground early in range, came under a ride in the two-path midway on the far turn, and could not gain with an even finish. TURKO TREAT prompted the
 pace outside COMMUNITY WATCH, and began to fade near the five-sixteenths pole. HEAVENLY HATTIE was outrun inside. HELOTES dropped back
 steadily after a half-mile, and had nothing left in the stretch.

 GROSCO (MEX) sped to the front soon after the start, set a pressured pace slightly off the inside around the turn, moved to the rail for the drive and held
 firm. OFF DUTY pressed the pace outside GROSCO from the outset, had aim through the stretch but could not get by. POLYGRAM stayed in range two
 wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed late response. HERE COMES MICHAEL moved up around the turn three wide, but flattened out into upper
 stretch. WILL MUNNINGS raced close-up inside to the stretch, and tired.

 GOOD AS MONEY bumped with ZAPTUIT at the start, stalked outside TOPHAT N WHITETIE for six furlongs, took over when ready in upper stretch and
 drew off under pressure. BARREL OF STOUT saved ground early, came widest for the drive and finished willingly to be along for the place. MEAD
 AVENUE broke slowly, raced three wide on the turns, and lacked a solid late bid. ZAPTUIT bumped with GOOD AS MONEY at the start, saved ground on
 the turns and was outfinished inside for larger shares. DONALDDEEISSOARING unseated the rider fractious behind the gate and was difficult to load, raced
 two wide and faded after six furlongs. TOPHAT N WHITETIE set the pace inside, was overhauled by the eventual winner into the stretch, and retreated.
 ROCKY DIPLOMAT was slow into stride and trailed throughout.

 POLISHED STEEL pressed the pace outside WIZARD OF ODDS, gained the upper hand edging away into the final furlong, then had enough to stave off
 SIR BOND through the closing strides. SIR BOND trailed inside for a half-mile, angled to the far outside through upper stretch, finished fastest and ran out
 of ground. DA WINNER IS raced in the second flight two to three wide for a half-mile, and rallied to pick up a share. WIZARD OF ODDS set the pace inside
 while hounded by POLISHED STEEL, and gave way through the last furlong. MORE FRONT was poised off the leaders three then four wide on the turn, but
 flattened out through the drive. SMALL GIANT moved up mildly three wide coming off the turn, but could not sustain the bid. IS EVERYBODY HAPPY
 showed early speed inside, lost ground to the leaders around the turn, and gave way.
