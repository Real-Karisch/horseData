 Footnotes
 MIX AND MINGLE bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was urged along on the outside, advanced four wide on the turn, took the lead at the
 three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. CHERRY BOMB BABY was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, moved
 out near the furlong marker and got up for the place. SHE'SFULLOFWONDER showed speed on the outside then moved clear, rounded the turn in the two
 path, lost the lead at the three-sixteenths and weakened but was clear for the show. PRIMAL PAST broke out and bumped with a rival, showed speed then
 chased the pace, raced inside early on the turn, moved to the two path around the quarter-pole and tired. BUZZ ON chased the pace, dropped back late on
 the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker and failed to rally. DRAMA TREE
 bumped with a foe at the start while last away then dropped back, was urged along at the rear, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into
 the stretch, drifted in late and failed to threaten. SNORING SUZZZZ was urged along towards the back, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to
 respond.
