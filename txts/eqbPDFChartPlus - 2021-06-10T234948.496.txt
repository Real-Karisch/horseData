 Footnotes
 TRUNK OF MONEY took the lead between foes, set the pace under rating, opened a long lead leaving the turn and extended the margin, winning under
 wraps. STORM BABE was in the four path and just off pace, split rivals on the turn and while no threat to winner, was best of the rest. LIL BULLETTE, two
 wide in second flight, tired. SEPTEMBER GURL saved ground just off the pace and also tired. DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY, wide and never far back, gave
 way leaving the turn. FAMILY FORTUNE failed to menace. ALLEGRETTO broke slowly then showed little. SUNSHINE BAY, in the four path, was no factor.
 I TOOK A SHOT was wide and well placed to the stretch then tired. LOTTERY QUEEN failed to threaten.

 CONTROLLED FURY set a pressured pace and held off repeated challenges to prevail in a determined effort. NOBLE KENT settled just off the leaders,
 angled out into the stretch and made a gradual late gain. ALAAPATIQUE forced the winner throughout but could not get by in a game try. IN EQUALITY
 broke slowly and quickly was steered inside, moved out in the strech but lacked a solid rally. BILLY BADPAY urged close up three wide to the final turn and
 faltered. FLEET FIRST dropped far behind and was never a factor. ONE SIDED lacked speed and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 SKOOKIE set the pace in the three path, shook loose to be clear near mid stretch and then just lasted. ICE CREAM PARTY waited for racing room on the
 backstretch, moved to the outside when rallying and was getting to winner. HAY BUCK, between rivals on far turn, was left with rail and was too late. ANA
 LASS prompted outside winner, fell back then finished evenly. LADY OF QUALITY was four wide dueling for the early lead, moved in and remained a factor
 to mid stretch and then faded. IWASBORNAWINNER came in and bumped TIZ TAS TIME soundly leaving the gate, raced very wide and failed to threaten.
 TIZ TAS TIME, bumped soundly leaving the gate then bobbled soon after, was hustled to rail just off the pace, came out a bit and bumped with
 MAGNIFICENT BELLE near mid stretch and gave way. MAGNIFICENT BELLE broke slowly, saved ground, split foes into stretch, came in a bit contributing
 to the bumping with TIZ TAS TIME, was quickly taken in hand and was being eased to the wire. WHITNEYDIANNE stopped suddenly and lost contact with
 the field.

 PRESS MY BETS broke slowly, saved ground, waited briefly for racing room near quarter, continue along the rail, engaged near the sixteenth pole and
 drifted out late. GLORY SONG set the pace just off the rail, drifted out into and through stretch and held on gamely. COMPOUND IT, unruly loading, raced
 in the five path early, moved in and stalked the pace, also drifted out through stretch and fought courageously to the wire. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE, four wide
 and just off pace, split rivals on the turn and then faded late. SHANGHAI CHECK broke slowly, raced very wide and failed to menace. CREATIVE GENIUS
 broke slowly and then passed tiring foes outside. IRISH MEADOW broke slowly and showed little. FROST'S SONG broke slowly, raced wide and tired. NO
 FOOLING DUDE, in the four path while just off the pace, tired badly. GRAND TETON stalked the early pace two wide, stopped after a quarter mile.

 stretch and continued gamely for the place. EASY RIVER split rivals rallying on the turn and finished well too late. LOCO LOBO vied betwen rivals to
 mid-stretch and weakened. HIDDEN BAMBOO dueled inside, steadied into the far turn and faded. SMOOTH DON B lacked speed outside and failed to
 threaten. BUZZ WITH ALEX dropped back early and was never a factor. TUFFY'S LUCKY was never in contention. CORSARIO chased within striking
 range outside early then gave way. CANDY CHOO lagged far behind throughout. RIGHTEOUS dropped back after the start and stopped abruptly. A claim
 of foul by the rider of HIDDEN BAMBOO against the rider of LOCO LOBO for interference into the far turn was dismissed.

 Footnotes
 MIDNIGHT BOUNTY three wide and just off pace, challenged on the backstretch, took the lead on the final turn, was clear in mid stretch and won under
 good handling. STAY SPECIAL unruly in the gate, lunged and hit the right side of gate at the start, recovered quickly and was well placed inside, was
 unable to match strides with winner but gamely held place. TEUFLES AND ROSES vied for command three wide, fought back for show. DON'S
 ESCAPADE always well placed between foes, weakened late. IGNITE was in tight racing into the first turn, raced in the four path and failed to menace.
 BANANA ANNA, very wide, failed to menace. PRETTY COOL CAT was also in tight racing into first turn then showed little. PINKOUT vied for command
 between foes then tired. CLARE'S DOWERY, in the five path, stopped and lost contact.
