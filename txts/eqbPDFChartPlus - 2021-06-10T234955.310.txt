 Footnotes
 CEEVEE, away alertly, pressed the pace from the inside, gained the lead with a quarter mile to run, was headed by TAKE COMMAND into the stretch,
 battled back and inched clear while drifting out a bit at the wire. UNCLE B led early then dueled outside the winner, raced between rivals on the turn, angled
 outside for the drive and finished gamely. TAKE COMMAND broke out a bit, stalked the pace while racing three wide, ranged up to assume command into
 the lane and weakened late. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL just appeared to dislike the going and was content to trail throughout.

 Footnotes
 ART'S TABLE broke in and bumped with COTTON TO, opened up a clear lead shortly after the start, was unchallenged but kept to task to the wire.
 ORGANIC JENNY raced in the middle of the pack for the first half, was four wide through the turn, offered a bid in late stretch but was no match for the
 winner. COOL MOVER was void of early speed and showed good late interest mid-track. COTTON TO, bumped at the start by the winner, dropped back
 early, drifted six wide into the stretch and improved his position late. EBRIO chase the pace from the rail and retreated in the stretch. KOKOMO WILDCAT
 pressed the pace from between foes and tired in the final furlong. UNCLE TBONE broke sharply, raced three wide on the turn, drifted six wide into the
 stretch and was not a factor.

 DANA GRACE broke out and bumped with CORY GAL at the start, was allowed to settle into stride, waited on the rail while saving ground, angled out
 sharply into the stretch, responded when asked and proved best late. CORY GAL broke in and bumped with the winner, went to the lead shortly after the
 start, dueled outside a rival, opened up a clear lead leaving the eighth pole and was no match for the fast closing winner late. ELISSAS SECRET stalked the
 pace while racing four wide early and through the turn, and had no late response. TALKBACK was a bit reluctant to load, dueled for the lead along the rail
 and tired in the final sixteenth. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE showed no speed, raced in the four path on the turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch and failed to
 threaten.

 NORTHERN pressed the pace then dueled outside a rival, shook that one off into the stretch, responded to intermittent left handed urging and was drawing
 away late. SHACKLEFORDS STORM angled over at the start, stalked while racing three wide, could not match strides with NORTHERN in the drive but
 was best of the rest. BE A HERO bumped at the break, was allowed to settle into stride, raced five wide through the turn and six wide into the lane,
 improved his position late. MY COWBOY saved ground to no avail. PACHANGA PARTY set a pressured pace while racing along the inside and tired in the
 final furlong. BEAUKATI angled to the rail shortly after the start and never threatened in a ground saving trip. NOSHACKLESHERE broke out slightly then
 was pressured in to bump with BE A HERO, raced four wide on the turn, appeared to jump his shadow mid-turn at the five-sixteenth pole and steadily
 retreated.

 Footnotes
 ESCONDERA, unhurried early, raced four wide through the turn, begin to commence his rally leaving the quarter marker and wore down SEVEN GEMS in
 the final strides. The latter was away alertly, set the pace while saving ground, opened up a clear lead and was overtaken late. UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL
 settled early, moved up to stalked the pace between rivals and showed no late bid. CHIEF WHITE SOX chased the pacesetter while racing along the inside
 and lacked a closing response. FARLEY showed brief foot, raced three wide on the turn, settled off the pace and showed no rally. CRAZY MAGIC appeared
 to dislike the going and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 NUNC PRO TUNC broke sharply, dueled for the lead while racing along the inside, bumped with SOLAR WARNING in upper stretch, was headed by that
 rival and came on again to get the win. SOLAR WARMING stalked the pace while saving ground, launched a bid from the inside with a quarter mile to run,
 bumped with the winner into the stretch, assumed command in mid-stretch and was outfinished. TOUPHA was three wide into the first turn, never far back
 while racing outside a rival down the backstretch, was four wide through the second turn and offered no late bid. SO NIFTY stumbled at the start, dueled
 from the outside, raced four wide through both turns and weakened. TACTICAL QUALITY raced three or four wide throughout and trailed.

 MALIBU RAINBOW was hustled away from the gate, pressed the pace while racing along the outside, responded when asked and proved best in a
 prolonged drive. PERFECT KIMBERLY S went to the front shortly after the start, led while racing removed from the rail and finished gamely in her debut.
 DIZZY stalked the pace along the inside early, angled out four wide into the turn, was five wide into the stretch and showed no late bid. LA
 INCONDICIONAL,alllowed to settle into stride, raced in the four path through the turn and lacked a closing response. LUCKY LITTLE LADY stalked the
 pace while saving ground and faded after a half mile. MILEY trailed and was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 ROYAL ASSCHER pressed the pace while racing outside BALADA, moved up to engage that one with a quarter mile to run, responded when set down for
 the drive and drew off under steady urging. BALADA broke sharply, set the pace while saving ground, was no match for the winner but finished as second
 best. FINAL FLURRY, away alertly, showed no speed and trailed to the quarter pole, moved between rivals and improved her position late. CHA CHA
 HEELS, allowed to settle into stride while racing outside a rival, was four wide through the turn, offered a bid at the quarter pole and lacked a late response.
 CHILLED MILK showed no avail in a ground saving trip. UMETUKA broke through the gate prior to the start, stalked the pace while racing three wide, was
 five wide through the turn and tired in the final quarter. SWEET STORY, void of early speed, raced five wide through the turn and failed to threaten.
