 Footnotes
 CHUCKLES CANDY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid four wide into the lane, then made a steady gain and drove
 clear. INJAAZAAT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the final furlong, then was no match for the winner and held the place
 safe. MR GREY (FR) allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. BIG
 RIG stalked the pace on the outside, saved ground on the two path while boxed through the turn, was blocked in the stretch and evened out. HUSSAR
 allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, then had no rally. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE TRAINER OF BIG RIG AGAINST
 THE RIDER OF MR GREY WAS NOT ALLOWED

 BUCKS WILDESCAPADE chased the pace off the rail, looped two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, then closed well late and
 edged ahead. SHAENA BUE allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled in and
 lacked the needed late kick, while gaining the place. JOEYVILLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin without challenge, then
 weakened late and held the show. JOE FLASH mid pack, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had a mild gain. SLY
 WILDCAT passed a tiring rival. FUSAICHI BAD BOY broke a step slowly from the gate, was well placed and inside and steadily lost ground.
