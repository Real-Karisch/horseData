 Footnotes
 THEGLORYISALLMINE set the pace inside, drew clear turning for home and widened into midstretch, had the rider lose the whip nearing the sixteenth pole
 then was not seriously threatened. SAND HARBOR pressed the issue from between rivals, chased through the lane and was second best. CLIFTON
 BEACH pulled and steadied along behind rivals in the run down the backstretch, bid four wide on the far turn and lacked the needed late response.
 SUANCES SECRET pressed the pace three deep and weakened into the lane. RUN FOREVER saved ground into the far turn, stayed inside and lacked the
 needed response.

 GAME STAR was inside and steadied some on the turn, raced off the rail turning for home, angled back in nearing the eighth pole then bested a rival to the
 wire. I'M FOCUSED set the pace and responded gamely in the drive but could not quite match the top one late. MR. MATLOCK saved ground and lacked
 the needed late response. NO SUPAH FOR YOU bid four wide into the turn and chased then weakened in the drive. SIR KOWBOY raced up close early
 just off the inside and tired through the lane. SPOON BOSS raced in the five path turning for home and had no rally. BARTOLOMEO trailed and had no
 rally. GO YOUR OWN WAY lunged outward at the break while quickly clear but away a bit awkwardly, raced three wide into the turn and gave way.

 BETTER THAN MAGIC just off the inside into the far turn, raced in the four path into the stretch and finished gamely to prevail. WHY FRANK well placed
 saving ground, bid along the rail in the lane and reached the front passing the eighth pole then continued on gamely to the wire. OH BROTHER JACK in
 good position early, bid three wide on the far turn, reached the front between calls in upper stretch and continued on willingly while needing more. MR.
 LOVEJOY dueled along the inside and yielded in the drive. JOYEUX saved ground and lacked a late response. TEMPLE KEYS lacked the needed rally.
 TRIBAL MONEY had no rally. AMERICAN LEAGUE moved up early and dueled outside a rival, was between foes turning for home and weakened.

 NIGHTLY NEWS bumped at the start and between rivals early, vied for command, held a narrow advantage through the stretch run and held gamely to the
 wire. RISKY FOREST three wide into the turn, raced in the five path entering the lane and also finished gamely while coming up just short. PRESIDENTIAL
 BIRD four wide entering the stretch, moved inward and chased then needed a bit more. BEACH MODE three deep early, vied for the lead on the turn, raced
 four wide into the stretch and weakened late. WHICH MARKET trailed early and offered a gradual stretch gain. ANTARES DREAM four wide into the turn,
 raced in the six path entering the lane and lacked the needed late response. ALLEN'S CROWN fractious briefly in the gate unseating the rider, moved up
 inside leaving the chute and tired in the drive. OUTLAW BY NATURE moved up early and vied for the lead, remained a factor on the turn and weakened.
 AWESOME WONDERER was through early.
