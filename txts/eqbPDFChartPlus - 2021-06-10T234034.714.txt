 Footnotes
 BAREEQA off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from the the three path, was switched over to a brisk hand ride at the five-sixteenths pole,
 tipped slightly wider for the drive home, closed in readily, wrested away the advantage with just under an eighth to go and kicked clear.
 HOPONTHEBUSGUS sparred for command from the get-go, going about it in the two path on the backstretch then as the outermost of a threesome in path
 three during the run around the bend, got let loose for the drive home, failed to keep pace with the winner once that rival assumed control in midlane, battled
 onward with good courage though against several others with run left in them also to procure the place. ALABAMA BOUND cut over towards the inside
 route shorlty after the field had been sent on its way, tracked the front runners, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, got caught in traffic after spinning
 into the lane, stuck behind a multi-equined wall, shifted wider and wider in a search for a usable seam, found it in path six right around the sixteenth pole,
 responded when finally given her cue rallying with good energy for the show. PUPAREE was guided over to the rail midway on the backstretch, had its route
 open up after AWESOME QUICK got out into path two shortly afterwards, eagerly moved up into the freshly-created hole to tackle on a pair of frontrunners,
 snatched away the advantage, was still leading when called upon for more cutting the corner into the lane, put up a fight prior to releasing to the winner in
 midstretch, stayed on well for the last major check. A DIXIE TWISTER two to three wide taking up the chase on the turn, got sent out six to seven during the
 stretch run, displayed some willingness but had to settle for a minor slice. ANNIE ROCKS off approximately one length the slowest, failed to menace off a
 ground-saving journey. AWESOME QUICK briefly placed on the rail early on the backstretch, was pulling noticeably on the left all the while, got out into path
 two a sixteenth shy of the half mile pole, was expertly kept there disputing the pace from between rivals, remained at it until the furlong grounds before
 faltering.

 Footnotes
 COOLBOY dueled from the three path with HOT BROWN to his inside early on, shook off that rival three furlongs from home widening away, spun just off
 the inside for home, drew off to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. HOT BROWN dueled from the two path early on with the aforementioned
 foe, tucked inside half a mile from home, got shaken off at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, ran on to secure the place honors. SEVEN IS
 HEAVEN coaxed from the gate, was outsprinted early and got placed to a firm hold and wrangled back five furlongs from home to near the rear, chased just
 off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild bid. FREUDIAN FATE just off
 the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share.
 THE HONEST TOUN bobbled at the break, got coaxed along chasing three then two wide, swung four wide for home and was outkicked. KINGFISH
 brushed the near side stall at the start, raced sluggish early growing detached at the tail of the field tucking just off the inside, came under coaxing
 seven-sixteenths from home, swung six wide into upper stretch and improved position. ODIN'S STEED three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
 the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, tired. PRINCIPAL DANCER five then four wide in pursuit, got pushed along at the three-eighths, went five to
 six wide into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 PECAN PATTIE coaxed along on the inside route vying with PAYNTER FEST during the initial stages, fell back without visible excuse a sixteenth shy of the
 half being completed, was being hand ridden keeping pace with the front runners while travelling on the turn, became entrapped in traffic beginning from the
 five-sixteenths pole, and wound remain blocked thus so for nearly a furlong, inched to the outside after stepping onto the top of the lane, gained an open
 seam along the three path soon afterwards when the runner up moved one wider herself after some left side stick work, took avail of the opportunity
 provided and was eagerly directed towards it, burst through with good energy when given her cue, snatched away the adantage just beyond the eighth pole,
 extended it, flashed the whip from the right several times both coming and going from the sixteenth polle before getting wrapped up in the last seventy
 yards. SOLITARY GEM raced along the outside, stalked the front runners from the three path on the turn, issued up a challenge stepping into the lane,
 drifted one path farther off the rail when fed some left side pressure in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, inadvertantly providing an escape route for
 the entrapped winner, got overpowered by that opponent in midstretch, ventured onward for place honors. FIRST DAWN pursued the front runners from the
 two path on the turn, was already under a drive before reaching the quarter pole, angled four wide into the stretch, had enough to be along for the show.
 CHILLINWITHFRIENDS was set up in the two path after the break, moved up to take on PAYNTER FEST coming up to the top of the bend, kept the
 pressure on all throughout the trip from there to the quarter pole, got set down to an all out drive stepping into the lane, put up a bid for another furlong,
 failed to claim the front end, then gave way in the final furlong. PAYNTER FEST was in path two contending for the top with the winner during the opening
 phases, kicked clear approaching the five-eighths pole, even with the tempo not having picked up at all, cut onto the inside route, had a new rival to contend
 with though, that being CHILLINGWITHFRIENDS out in the path two, was turned loose for the drive home, got overhauled and backed away readily.

 DURESS broke in a step at the start and was corrected, settled in pursuit just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the pocket into the turn
 taking up cover in behind RED MULE, sat perched just off the pace spat through the turn, angled out into daylight four wide into upper stretch roused for the
 drive, rallied to take command a furlong from home, then inched away to the finish kept to task. BEBEAU coaxed from the gate, dueled three wide down the
 backstretch with RED MULE to his inside, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over sole command
 nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat getting collared at the eighth pole, ran on willingly to chase the winner
 home clear of the rest and along second best. MR. MIKE coaxed from the gate, chased three wide in aim of the duel down the backstretch, tucked to the
 two path into the turn and raced between foes as a trio stacked just in behind the battling top pair nose to nose on the front, got placed to coaxing
 five-sixteenths from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while up for the show honors in the very last jump to the wire.
 RED MULE hustled from the gate, dueled along the inside with BEBEAU to his outside in the three path, had that rival tuck right next door through the turn
 and continued to cling to the front knocking heads through the bend until displaced nearing the quarter pole when put to coaxing, cut the corner into upper
 stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened steadily through to the finish. TALLESTOFTHETALL away to an awkward beginning, chased three wide from
 near the rear of the field down the backstretch, tucked to the inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung four wide into
 upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SINGLE FOCUS just off the inside in pursuit from near the rear, took to the inside through the turn coming under a ride
 at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. AZZEDINE (FR) four wide in pursuit just off the pace
 down the backstretch, tucked three wide half a mile from home and bid into contention stacking outside a pair just off the duel when put to coaxing three
 furlongs from home, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and backed away. BRIDGETOTHEFUTURE four to five wide in pursuit from near the rear
 down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact.

 BANK EXAMINER among the rear breakers after the field had been released, moved up into midpack, was in hand cruising up to the pacesetter from path
 four after entering the turn, scooted by a tiring opponent and tucked closer to the rail, that being about in the two path, at the midway point, ventured onward
 confidently ridden, was in path three getting set down at the three-sixteenths pole to challenge in earnest, took control in short order, kept going with good
 energy to stay sufficiently in the clear. MARY'S GIRL took up the chase from the three patn on the bend, was under encouragement fanning out a couple
 paths wider into the lane, finished willingly, although no match today. CHEATHAM HILL at or near the inside route in pursuit of the front runners, moved into
 the two path in midstretch, had enough of a response to be along for the show. SWEET MEADOW MIST hung out four wide on the turn, got sent out into
 path six from upper to midstretch, maintaining its status of being the widest of all, rallied mildly for the last major check. BUSTIN SCONES three wide onto
 the turn, was in path five after exiting it, made no impact. SHE'S SO SHEA D hand urged to establish the front end, saw the winner draw alongside at the
 three-eighths pole, clung to a narrow lead the rest of the way to the end of the bend, surrendered at the top of the lane, and faltered. ITS A CHANCE in path
 two disputing the pace while pulling hard on the bit, was through by the five-sixteenths marker. TAKE ME TO HARDOON a forward factor stationed in the
 two path, tired after going a half.

 Footnotes
 WINIFRED J established the front shortly after the start and showed the way coaxed along just off the inside through swift splits, tucked inside half a mile
 from home, swung four then three wide into upper stretch straightened away, forged clear to the eighth pole and held well and clear to prevail. PLINK
 FREUD broke out at the start nudging MIGHTY KNIGHT outwards and pinching that rival and PENDOLINO out against LOUGH NA MONA, chased just off
 the inside from near the rear of the field, had to be briefly taken in hand and steadied just inside the three-eighths as LOUGH NA MONA, steadied in front off
 the heels of FIGHT ON LUCY, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, tipped out near the eighth pole and
 kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors in the final jumps. FREDDYMO FACTOR tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the
 five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish and was just collared for the place honors in the final strides. LOUGH
 NA MONA saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, got forced to steady off the heels of FIGHT ON LUCY just inside the three-eighths as that rival drifted in
 slightly and in turn caused PLINK FREUD to be taken hold of in behind, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide at the head of the
 stretch and kept on to secure the last major share. TOSSUP two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths,
 angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. PENDOLINO got forced to steady when squeezed back at the start due to pressure from
 the inside and conceded four to five lengths before settling into stride, chased two to three wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
 three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the late stages. COREY SCORES forwardly placed three wide down
 the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, was
 shaken off and dug in under a drive, weakened through to the finish. ROUSEY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
 angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FIGHT ON LUCY just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the
 three-eighths drifting in slightly and forcing a pair of rivals in behind to steady briefly inside that station, angled out four wide for home and weakened in the
 stretch. MIGHTY KNIGHT got floated out by the outwards breaking PLINK FREUD and was pinched back at the start in tandem with PENDOLINO,
 conceded four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four then three wide from the tail of the field under motivation from midway on the
 turn, continued four wide for home and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 PERFORMER established control in short order, was coaxed along showing the way from the two path on the backstretch, accompanied by MIHOS to the
 outside, was in processing of turning back that foe when pounced on by the runner up from along the rail as three-quarters was being completed, got
 headed, raced directly aside that one the rest of the way to the top of the lane, had re-asserted himself to the front end when asked for more in the general
 area of the three-sixteentsh pole, gave the desired response and edged away. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS guided over to the rail after the start, kept watch
 within range of the front runners from the pocket, began the run around the bend under some hand urging, was then put to much stronger handling
 unleashing bold bid approaching the five-sixteenths marker, struck the front end at that station, extended that advantage to about as much as a neck or so,
 turned into the lane as a team with the winner, had already yielded when the nemesis was asked for run right around the three-sixteenths marker, ventured
 on with good determination after relinquishing until deep stretch, then just held the place. BONUS POINTS away forwardly placed, pursued the pace from
 midpack, departed the backstretch from the three path, had its lane open up when its former occupant, that being MIHOS, vacated it for path two himself at
 the five-sixteentsh marker, got driven four wide into the lane, straightened away, closed the gap on GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS, missed the place. DYNAMAX
 PRIME was set up in the two path proceeding along the two path, got set down midpoint on the turn, was moved out five wide from upper to midstretch,
 lacked the needed response to make any impact. MIHOS was in path three sparring for command with the winner for the opening six furllongs, lighty urged,
 fell back and tucked into the path after six furlongs, saw the pilot put the mount on hold for the next furlong, got re-roused afterwards, but to no avail. NO
 DISTORTION sighted pulling ranikly on the bit being maneuvered onto the inside route at the conclusion of the backstretch, went on to save ground to no
 avail.

 drive to the sixteenth marker, dug in and held safe from a late charging rival to prevail on the wire. CRYSTALLE got away a half a beat slow without incident
 and lost her lane at the start, saved ground at the tail of the field early on before tipping two to three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, went nine wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to just latch on the aforementioned foe as she hit the finish. JAZZIQUE (IRE) bumped
 at the start by MY SASSY SARAH breaking inwards, tracked the pace along the inside, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the
 quarter pole, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away under threat to the outside from the eventual winner,
 got headed a furlong from home, ran on to secure the show honors. SPARKLING SKY got bumped at the start by ENGLISH BREEZE and was pinched
 back conceding four lengths to the front, chased three to four wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went eight
 wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the last major share. ENGLISH BREEZE broke out at the start bumping and pinching back
 SPARKLING SKY, chased three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kicked on

 K'S GIRL to the inside, poked a head in front six furlongs from home and steadily shook off that rival gaining clearance to tuck to the two path five furlongs
 from home, widened away into the far turn given some rein to work with before coming under coaxing past the three-eighths, got out to a drive nearing the
 quarter pole, spun just off the inside at that station under growing threat, yielded command straightened away for home and weakened to the finish. AVA
 K'S GIRL broke out at the start, pulled early on a bit rank along the inside before knocking heads from the two path with the aforementioned foe to her
 outside down the backstretch, got displaced from command six furlongs from home and was steadily shaken off nearing the far turn, came under coaxing
 near the three-eighths, retreated through the latter portion of the bend and went six wide for home, then tired in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 ENGLISH HUMOR broke open the gate prior to the first attempt to send the field off and running, thrashed about making some contact with it but didn't run
 off, was backed out and after being examined by the gate-side veterinarian was re-loaded, proceeded to come out bit, bumping with another in the shadow
 of the starting gate, was yanked away as a corrective measure, then after being fed some hand encouragement got going, appeared a bit keen at times
 during the remainder of the journey leading up to the conclusion of the backstretch, left it in the two path, stayed within striking distance of the front runners,
 angled three wide into the lane and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, was one of a sextet with a fighting chance for the top spot at the beginning of
 the last eighth, forged on ahead with good courage getting closer and closer to the front end, out-fought three determined foes in the final stages to get up at
 the wire. BIG WONDER remained forwardly placed after an alert beginning, hitched up to LOADED JOE as the first fraction was being finalized, pressed the
 issue two to three wide on the turn, struck the front end late on the bend, sputtered a little spinning into the lane, settled in about four wide and was called
 upon for more, failed to shake free, instead coming under seige from numerous rivals, tried to gut it out, but got nailed at the end.
 MONKEYSEEMONKEYDO sat prominently placed while taking the inside route, got cued up tipping to the outside and eventually in the two path for the
 drive home, had clear passage along it and crept up to BIG WONDER, vied on with vigour thereafter, fighting with as many three others before done, got
 denied. WHAT'S TO BLAME off the inside throughout, travelled in path three racing around the turn, fanned out into the five path from upper to midstretch,
 closed in with good energy but had to settle for the final significant slice of the purse. GOOD SOLUTION away a bit on the slow side after stutter-stepping its
 way out of the starting gate, was in path two in pursuit of the front runnners on the turn, swung into path four for the drive home, narrowed in before
 flattening out in the last seventy yards. LOADED JOE grabbed the advantage after the start, cut over to the inside route, was forced to contend with the
 second place finisher to the outside, relinquished for good right around the quarter pole, stayed strongly in contenton for the next furlong then weakened.
 LARCENY in slightly springing from the starting gate, bumped with CAMOUFLAGED KISSER shortly afterwards, recovered and took up the chase two wide,
 was put to a drive in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, went a couple of paths farther off the rail once into the stretch, lacked the needed response.
 CAMOUFLAGED KISSER pinched at the start, was pulling hard dashing over to the rail afterwards, wound up trailing throughout.
