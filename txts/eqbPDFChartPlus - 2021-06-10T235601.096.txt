 FOUR KNIGHTS was jostled between rivals leaving the gate, rushed to a clear lead, set a reserved pace, was hustled into the stretch and widened under a
 drive. BOYHOOD DREAM, unhurried to the far turn, was roused two and three-wide on the final turn then closed willingly but did not menace. CHILLING
 SECRET stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response. MICK THE CONQUEROR raced in mid pack, chased
 hard while two and three-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. NIGHT WATCHMAN, in range, was hustled three to five-wide on the far turn but could
 not close the gap. HUSSAR broke inward and was steadied, raced in mid pack, closed three to five-wide on the final turn, finished gamely but was not a
 threat. KING'S DREAM settled in mid pack, raced along the rail and two-wide on the far turn but lacked a response in the stretch. FINE GRIND, in range
 early, was hustled from the rail on the far turn but evened out in the final furlong. BLU COLLAR ROMANCE settled in mid pack, was hustled three and
 four-wide on the turn, dropped back approaching the stretch and tired.

 DOWNY BOY broke outward, settled in mid pack, chased three to five-wide on the turn, was all out in the stretch and got up late. FAHRENHEIT lost his
 path soon after leaving the gate, stalked the pace, bid near the 1/4 pole, had the lead at the top of the stretch but failed to hold the winner safe in the late
 stages. WILEY O'RIELLY raced in mid pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. SUMMER RETREAT set a
 reserved pace, was joined late turn, yielded at the top of the stretch and gave way. WINSROY hopped at the start, settled off the pace, chased hard angling
 from the rail to three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. STANDING RESERVE rushed up but was checked behind the leader late backstretch,
 chased along the rail through the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. CHARLES STREET broke well, dropped back quickly and trailed the field.

 MY SILENCER broke outward, sprinted to a clear lead, set a reserved pace, was set down upper stretch, widened when asked and held sway under a
 strong hand ride. SEGUIMI stalked early, pressed the pace on the turn, chased two-wide into the stretch, battled with a rival down the lane and held place.
 DONNIE BRASCO raced in mid pack, chased two-wide late turn then rallied gamely. BENS LAST CALL stalked the pace, chased along the rail late turn,
 dueled for position but yielded place mid stretch then lost the show position late. KRACHENWAGEN, herded outward at the start, stalked the pace briefly
 then settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide late turn but never reached contention. CAMP NARDO settled off the pace, was hustled three and
 four-wide on the turn but evened out in the final 16th. GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST raced from off the pace, chased two to four-wide on the turn but lacked a

 JUNGLE FIGHTER chased the early duelers along the inside, angled off the inside to loom up while three wide on the far turn, wearing down the front
 runner by the sixteenth pole and held that one safe driving to the wire. DINO THREE O NINE led quickly before allowing a rival to to take over around the
 first turn, came off the rail to stalk that rival until re-taking the lead turning for home, giving way grudgingly to the winner from the sixteenth pole to the wire.
 ABE FROMAN was off the pace early before commencing a three to four wide run on the far turn into a contending spot, but could only manage to
 stubbornly hold third without threatening the top pair. RISING STAR raced well off the pace early before putting in a nice rail rally around the far turn, was
 still inching up at the wire to just miss the show spot. DYNAMIC FORCE pressed the leader into the first turn before taking the lead, held a pressured
 advantage around the far turn before giving up the front at the quarter pole and faded from the eighth pole to the wire. MAYAN GHOST was chasing the
 leaders in the two path throughout, but had no response when roused by the rider midway on the far turn and retreated down the lane.
