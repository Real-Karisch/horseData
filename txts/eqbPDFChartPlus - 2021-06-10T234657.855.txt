 Footnotes
 MY PROPHET outrun in the early going off the inside, swung out five wide turning for home, displayed good energy down the middle of the strip to win
 going away. RECKLESS RANSOM also raced back off the lively early fractions, angled three wide into the lane, bid between foes a furlong out, could no
 match strides with the winner lace, clear for the place. MY NEW GUITER well back early as well, four wide exiting the turn and inside the winner, along for
 show, no match for the top two late. I RATE FIRST with the early pace three wide, dueled into the lane, was weakening when losing whip with a furlong
 remaining. STORMATION helped set a quick early pace while along the inside, also faltered the final furlong. WILDWOOD DEJAVU flashed brief early foot
 between rivals and stopped.

 Footnotes
 TOR CON SIX prompted the early leader from the outside, engaged that one from the outside when straightened for home, lengthy stretch duel, fully
 extended to prove best. CASH FOR THE SOUL broke on top, set the pace off the inside, dueled with the winner stretch, gave ground grudgingly to that foe
 while remaining clear for the place. BITSY'S CARLOS fell back off the top two after the start, saved ground to no avail while making a mild gain late.

 Footnotes
 FUHR A SLAM showed the way out of the chute, set the pace under light restraint up the backstretch and through the turn, drew out steadily through the
 lane to win ridden out. COMMANDING ACTION chased the winner early, fell back off the issue into the stretch, came back late for the place while well out in
 the strip, no threat to the winner. PALMETTOVOWMENOT broke out, advanced after a quarter, chased the winner out of the turn and past the furlong
 marker, faltered for the second position late while well inside the runner up at the wire. SHILOH COUNTY floated out at the start, lacked speed, angled out
 four wide turning for home, improved position while remaining well out in the strip. SHE'S A PENALTY lacked speed, was five wide out of the turn, made
 little impact in the drive. MINI MA forwardly placed in the early going, steadily faded. I B SWEET floated out at the start, trailed throughout to be always
 outrun.

 CAPTAIN TYREE allowed to settle off the pace toward the inside, steered out a bit when beginning to advance far turn, continued to rally on the outside
 through the lane and finished with good resolve to be up in time. WHISTLING RANGER closest to the leader, challenged that one from the outside late in
 the final turn, dueled past the furlong marker, outkicked by the winner in the final strides while between rivals. ETBAUER'S IDE broke on top, cleared toward
 the inside before a quarter, rated when showing the way up the backstretch, responded when the runner up challenged turning for home, proved stubborn
 until late while closest to the inside of the first flight. WHOAJOEY away in good order, went one paced throughout in lacking a late response. A HE'S AN
 O'PRADO remained back in lacking a rally. DADDY BILL trailed throughout in showing little.

 Footnotes
 TOUGH KICKS was finished after three furlongs while racing outside. RACH'SLASTSCARF away in good order, set the pace inside, edged clear nearing
 the furlong marker and maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. MIRACLES YANKEE broke on top, allowed the winner to go
 early, chased that one throughout and could not challenge through the lane while remaining clear for the second spot late. CRIMSON FELINE slight bobble
 and bump to be last away, trailed well back into the turn, rallied on the outside through the lane and was going best of all at the end. PRINCESS LU LU
 angled in to save some ground into the turn, improved slightly in the drive while not a serious threat to the top three. OUR GOLDEN GIRL settled off the
 pace, came up empty for the drive. TOGA'S MARGROCK also retreated through the stretch.

 Footnotes
 CREOLE WILDFIRE close up from the start, took over from the outside entering the stretch, edged clear the final furlong under steady handling. QUICK FIX
 moved up along the inside to show the way up the backstretch and into the turn, dueled inside the winner entering the stretch, could not match strides with
 that rival the final furlong, remained clear for the place. PUCKERUPANDKISSME went evenly paced off the inside to finish best of the rest. LAYLA'S LADY
 void of speed, fanned six wide into the lane when being roused, improved position down the center of the strip. KEEPIN'ITTOGETHER lacked early foot,
 improved position while racing through some traffic down the stretch. SINNY SIN SIN raced in mid pack early off the inside, was tilted out five wide into the
 lane, failed to muster a closing response. TRISH MESHELL settled off the pace, also had little for the drive. FINEST KYLIE back off the pace while outside,
 five wide entering the stretch, failed to rally as well. ANGELIC GEM forwardly placed for a half, stopped in the drive.

 GATO AMERICANO forwardly placed into the first turn, allowed the pace to go after a quarter, angled out four wide into the stretch, challenged approaching
 the furlong marker then kicked clear in the final sixteenth. FAN BOX vied up front while between horses throughout, proved no match for the winner late,
 clearly second best. I PROMISED YOUHUFF also with the pace from the start, vied three wide, could not keep pace in the final furlong, narrowly saved the
 show. SIMBA'S PRIDE void of early foot while racing outside, began a steady advance after five furlongs and was gaining for the show late. SIZZLIN
 FLYER with the pace for six furlong closest t to the ;inside, gave way in the drive. WATCHOUTFOR TAYLOR raced in the second flight for a half off the
 inside, faded. CAPTINSDIVINEPICK was never involved, finished far back. NORTHSHORECORREDOR was finished early and also reported home far

 BORN AGAIN GEORGE got clear out of the chute, showed the way into and through the turn, shrugged off a foe late in the bend, clear again a furlong out,
 enough left to last. ROCKNBOWL void of speed for a half, steered out widest when straightened for home, set down for the drive and finished willingly to be
 rapidly getting to the winner. STATE TREASURER void of speed, came four wide out of the turn when rallying, closest to the winner with a furlong to run,
 flattened out a bit in the late going and was unable to contain the runner up. INSPIRE COURAGE bothered slightly at the start to be last away, trailed in the
 two path into the lane,improved a bit late while not a serious threat. SOUL P SAY broke out to bother INSPIRE COURAGE, was straightened to race in mid
 pack, lacked a closing kick when called on for the drive. SILVER SPUN forwardly placed for a half off the inside, backed up in the drive. SONG N A CAT
 chased the winner early, began a steady retreat after four furlongs.

 Footnotes
 GARY off the pace while racing outside, three wide into the lane, steered out a bit when set down, late bid, quickly clear in the final strides.
 LOOKINGFORROSES away well, showed the way up the backstretch, shook clear turn, continued to lead by daylight past the furlong marker, proved no
 match late for the winner, well clear of the othrs. LOUGAROU within striking distance early, continued in the second flight turn, lacked a winning response in
 the drive, narrowly lasted for the show. LIGHTNING LEWIS settled in mid pack early, roused, slowly gaining for the show late, no threat to the top two.
 ANDY'S PRODUCTION pressured the winner for three furlongs in the two path, had little left for the drive. TYLERS BANDIT void of early foot, picked off a
 couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. ANDWE'LLBESWINGING failed to menace. MATOU a bit rank at the start to be off slow, remained back
 throughout.
