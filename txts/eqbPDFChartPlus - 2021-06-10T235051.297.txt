 ARROGANT soon led, saved ground through the turn while taking some pressure from GREENHORN, turned that foe back from the three sixteenths, and
 held an advantage under a drive in the lane. GREENHORN stalked the pace, pressed outside the leader while in the three path on the turn, was turned
 back for good near the three sixteenths, but ran on well enough to hold second. COSTLY KING reared at the break, settled inside near the rear, saved
 ground through the turn, and found his best up the rail in the final eighth of a mile. AZEG tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, gradually angled
 out from near the three sixteenths, and ran on with interest three wide. PRINCE WHO came inward bumping TWO MINUTE MAN in the opening strides,
 chased the pace two wide on the backstretch, was urged three wide intoo the far turn, raced in the three path around the turn, and ran evenly late. A J'S
 POSSE tracked the pace outside in the backstretch, raced between horses on the far turn, but weakened in the lane. TWO MINUTE MAN was bumped by

 began to kick clear near the eighth pole but was sniped by the closers. TOMASITA was allowed to settle off the pace while on the inside but did not have
 enough. FRINGE hit the gate at the start then sat well rated off the pace, went two and three wide around the turn while sitting well rated off the pace,

 the break and bumped into AMBERJACK in the process, tracked the pace between horses going two wide around the turn but did not have enough to win.
 OH OZ chased the pace between horses going two wide around the turn but had no rally. HAWK'S IMAGE was allowed to settle off the pace, saved ground
 for most of the turn but had to swing into the stretch going four wide, finished evenly. FOUR LEFT FEET tracked the pace on the inside but weakened for
 the drive. AMBERJACK got jostled around at the start then trailed the field, was able to pass a tired rival. HAY NET hit the gate at the start but shook it off,
 chased the pace on the outside going three wide around the turn, had no response when asked for more.

 and continued mildly as the best of the rest. MO'S M V P hit the gate, tracked three wide in the backstretch and the far turn, but was flat in the lane.
