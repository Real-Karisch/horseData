 MIZ MAYHEM matched strides in opening stages positioned outside of CRAZY FOR SOPHIA, held slight edge still unasked through the turn, responded
 when promoted and shook free to clear command, wrapped up in the end. CRAZY FOR SOFIA broke near the lead then raced just off top pair, inched up
 closer leaving the turn then set down driving three wide in the lane, could not reach winner, continued steady effort for second best. MAKE ME PROUD
 hustled up along rail in the turn then shaken up three to four wide in the lane without making late impact. SLY BEAUTY dueled inside of winner at the start
 and continued battle back along rail in the turn, could not match rival upper stretch, flattened out. GIFT OF GLORY away in good order then dropped back
 and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 CONGRATS IN BLUE saved ground early, moved up in the two-path and shadowed OSCURA around the far turn, challenged in earnest turning for home,
 and edged away in the last sixteenth of a mile. OSCURA sprinted clear early, responded when CONGRATS IN BLUE ranged alongside at the top of the
 lane, and fought gamely before relenting late. BLAME IT ON DIXIE raced in the two-path on the first turn, crept closer to the leaders outside up the
 backstretch, was roused three wide nearing the quarter-pole, could not kick on with the top two in upper stretch but kept on with good courage to the finish.
 DEA took an awkward initial step to the left at the break, saved ground well back early, rallied mildly two wide between rivals on the far turn, and had no final
 kick. FAST MAMA bumped solidly with LOST PRINCESS at the start, raced three wide much of the way, and posed no threat outside through the lane.
 SHEZ A GREAT ONE bumped solidly with LOST PRINCESS at the start, raced two wide until shifting to the rail midway on the far turn, and lacked a solid
 bid inside. LOST PRINCESS was sandwiched between horses and checked back at the start, and was outrun.

 MERCURIAL MISS hustled up out of gate and briefly held slim lead before hooking up on front end with SAMARA, continued to battle along inside through
 the turn, edged away from stubborn SAMARA then finished clear. SAMARA slightly bobbled then bumped between at the start, quickly advanced racing
 near equal terms for lead running outside of MERCURIAL MISS, continued to battle two path entering the lane then lost edge to winner, kept on stubbornly
 then settled for second best. HEAVENS PULPIT moved head, away slow at the start, raced along outside then swept up three wide engaging top pair near
 quarter pole, flattened some entering lane, drifted in couple paths then straightened left handed, finished evenly. WHIP ME INTO SHAPE veered out at the
 start then angled inside to save ground racing of early speed, hustled up two path through the turn, swung out five wide entering the lane and finished with
 response. MAURAS FOREVER raced outside in range then dropped to rail in the turn, came out path top stretch then switched back to rail, set down driving
 with response but needed more for serious impact. MONTEREY MARIANNE raced inside of rival just off top pair in early stages then flattened out in the
 lane. SHE'S ALWAYS READY raced in second flight positioned outside of rival then gaveway in the lane.

 BEYOND SMART tugged his way along and led inside through a good part of the first quarter-mile, took back and settled down letting CREAKY CRICKET
 and MR. ONLINE duke it out up front to the far turn, followed close behind shifting off the rail nearing the stretch, tipped out three wide given his cue once
 straightened away, and ran past the duelers through the last furlong under mild hand urging. CREAKY CRICKET bumped with MCFLY at the start,
 contested the pace between horses around the first turn, moved to the rail dueling with MR. ONLINE, battled with that one all the way to the wire and got the
 bob for second. MR. ONLINE pressed the pace widest of a trio on the opening bend, shifted in a path dueling outside CREAKY CRICKET, kept on
 determinedly and missed the place. PICKETTS CORNER saved ground on the turns, moved outside for the drive and rallied mildly. ISLAND THERAPY
 broke slowly, moved up three wide through the middle stages, loomed a threat outside BEYOND SMART coming off the far turn, but lacked a final bid.
 FORALL THE MARBLES was gathered back off the leaders to the first turn, and stayed in range three wide on the far turn before tiring. MCFLY bumped
 with CREAKY CRICKET at the start, and raced two wide on the turns while being outrun.

 Footnotes
 SWEET MAGIC was allowed to settle in opening stages then angled inside and steadily advanced engaging second flight, shook the reins pick up pace
 leaving the backstretch, angled out gathering momentum under drive three wide at quarter pole, came out wider turning for home then kicked by SECRET
 PLEASURE nearing furlong marker, finished going away. SECRET PLEASURE applied pressure to TAPETE CLAIRIE in opening stages then edged up
 past half mile marker to duel for lead, shook free briefly clearing lead past quarter pole, kept under drive with good response then no match for winner near
 furlong marker. UNTRUTHFUL SONNET bumped with rival at the start then rated under snug hold racing off top two flights, let out notch edging closer then
 given cue four wide near the quarter pole, raced widest entering lane then remained in pursuit gaining on place in deep stretch finishing well clear over rest.
 TAPETE CLAIRE held slim lead under pressure then dueled along inside of SECRET PLEASURE, could not match strides leaving the turn then dropped
 back in the lane. FAST GIRL bumped with rival at the start, raced between rivals in second flight at five eighths pole then steadily retreated.
 SHELLSHACKUP stalked along outside through early stages then failed to sustain bid midway through turn.

 Footnotes
 BEAUKATI dueled for the lead outside HAIL TO VICTORY late on the backstretch and into the turn, received a fresh challenge as MITOS Y LEYENDAS
 joined the fray from the outside at the five-sixteenths, and gamely clung to a short lead inside the latter through a long drive. MITOS Y LEYENDAS pressed
 the pace from outside, ranged up three wide to join the leaders before going a half-mile, battled outside BEAUKATI through the stretch and could not get by.
 INMYFATHERSIMAGE moved up while shifting out around the turn, had aim four wide into the stretch, and kept on willingly while unable to reach the top
 two. AUSABLE saved ground early, had the two-path turning for home and made no headway. HAIL TO VICTORY was sent through on the rail to duel with
 BEAUKATI midway up the backstretch, felt the whip before reaching the quarter-pole and faded inside. RANCHO raced four wide into the turn, moved in to
 the two-path by the top of the lane and failed to become a factor. ZACHARY'S PITCH broke open the stall door prior to the start, was slowest to begin, and
 moved to the rail around the turn while remaining outrun. FIFTH AVENUE FLASH had speed outside to the turn, and faded in the four-path after going a
 half-mile.

 leaving quarter pole, hit once right handed past eighth pole then shown whip then ridden out late while pulling away. STARSHIP REINA quickly cleared on
 top and saved ground along inside, lost lead to winner going by quarter pole, continued steady effort finishing clearly second best. CARAMEL MARTINI in
 range off top two leaders racing five then four wide through the backstretch, launched bid in the turn but failed to close in on top pair, kept on three to four
 wide, best of rest. WHO'S CALLING step slow at the start then hustled up briefly racing in contention then steadily retreated. JAMIE'S DANCER raced in
 back along outside and failed to make bid. HELEN VIRGINIA showed brief interest racing widest through the backstretch then dropped back.

 Footnotes
 PROUD O'PADDY saved ground just behind the leaders for six furlongs, came off the rail awaiting clearance nearing the stretch, found a lane in the
 three-path after straightening away and responded to get up outside MAHVELOUS KITTEN in the closing yards. MAHVELOUS KITTEN tracked outside
 QUEEN ROSE for six furlongs, wrested command at the top of the lane, drove clear through the furlong grounds, and just failed to last. SPICY NELLY
 bumped with NEWMANS FAST GIRL at the start, went along under a firm hold near the back early, came three wide off the far turn and rallied mildly
 between horses. NEWMANS FAST GIRL bumped with SPICY NELLY at the start, steadied slightly twice heading to the first turn inside, remained along the
 rail getting shuffled back on the far turn, was roused into the stretch and could not make her presence felt. HAZANA settled in range two wide early, made a
 run in the three-path to loom a threat approaching the stretch, then faded through the late stages. LISA LIMON saved ground until swinging out four wide
 near the stretch, and made no headway. QUEEN ROSE rated along clear through a hassle-free half-mile, was collared by MAHVELOUS KITTEN turning for
 home and faltered inside.

 Footnotes
 MAGALIE sped to lead saving ground along rail in first turn, maintained advantage in early stages then came under pressure from FOLLOW NO ONE, took
 on added challenge of VALEDICTORIAN, dueled inside of duo through the turn then took command upper stretch and held gamely under driving finish.
 VALEDICTORIAN settled nicely stalking early pace, inched up leaving the backstretch, dueled three deep then lost edge to MAGALIE top stretch, remained
 determined in striking distance but could not reach winner, settled for second best. FOLLOW NO ONE raced in tracking mode just off leader then edged up
 applying pressure to MAGALIE, given cue, dueled between rivals through the turn, could not match strides at head of lane, kept up close then flattened in
 final furlong. SPECIAL EVENT raced in range just off top trio then drifted out weakening in turn, continued outside bid under right handed drive without
 posing late threat. LINDA MIMI was unhurried racing near the back then dropped to rail saving ground, hustled up along inside in turn, continued bid up
 inside without threatening late. GIULIA steadied at the start then taken under a hold and pulled wanting to do more, continued under slight restraint racing
 wide, angled in two path briefly but lost interest then back out and eased to wire.

 Footnotes
 POCKET CHANGE was outsprinted for the lead by FOCUS ON ME heading to the turn, chased that one from the outside to the stretch, came under steady
 left-handed urging nearing the eighth-pole, and got up in the last 50 yards. FOCUS ON ME bumped with SONIC BOOM at the start, cleared off to the inside
 with the lead heading to the turn, dug in still clear past the furlong marker, but could not hold on. FIREMAN OSCAR bumped with SONIC BOOM at the start,
 lacked speed saving ground around the turn, and found his best stride through the stretch on the rail. MONGO NATION chased the leaders under pressure
 two wide around the turn, made no headway and was outkicked for the show. SONIC BOOM was bumped between horses at the start, raced well back
 around the turn, came four wide into the lane and did not menace. FRENCH QUARTER saved ground to the turn, had the two-path for the drive and failed
 to factor. BIG ROCK raced two to three wide on the turn and lacked a response.
