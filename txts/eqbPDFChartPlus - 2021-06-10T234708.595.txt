 IRANISTAN rallied into contention on the final of three turns then gained a short lead a with a furlong remaining and drove clear. REAL FACTOR matched
 strides racing in the two path and resisted gamely to the end. SURVEY (IRE) was unhurried early racing in the second flight, was put to a drive into the far
 turn and finished willingly. CLUTCH CATCH saved ground racing in the second flight then needed more in the drive. APOLLO'S FAVORITE unseated his
 rider coming onto the track and ran off a half mile then saved ground disputing the pace before fading in the drive. NEGOTIATE was forwardly placed then
 tired. FIRST DEGREE BURN showed little. ZY steadily gave ground.
