 Footnotes
 C C HARRIS narrowly showed the way out of the chute, cleared before a quarter, steadily increased advantage through the turn and stretch while being
 kept to task. SILVER ZEPHYR forwardly placed early along the inside, chased the winner into the turn, two path into the lane, proved no match in the run to
 the wire, fully extended to hold the place while drifting out late. KEEP THE COMMISH bumped at the start, fell well back off he pace, two path into the lane
 when being called for some run, rallied and was getting to the runner up late. SUCCESSFUL SHOT last to leave, improved position while saving ground into
 the lane, flattened out in the final sixteenth to lose the show. MR CRUZE closest to the winner early, gradually faded. TAKE CHARGE EASY well back off
 the pace and the inside, five wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. CALMACK settled off the early pace, had little left for the drive.
 HEARTSETSMEONFIRE tired in the drive. I'M A C LOOKER remained always back. UNBRAIDED bumped at the start, fell quickly back to trail, showed
 little.

 Footnotes
 CHIEF KNOCKAWAY forwardly placed off the inside, challenged three wide in the second turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane, shook clear in
 midstretch, enough left to hold off the runner up in the final strides. STANTON C void of speed for six furlongs, shifted out four wide when advancing into the
 stretch, closed with good energy to be rapidly getting to the winner late. BEAT GOES ON off a step slow, moved up the opening quarter to become
 prominent along the inside, asked along and took over into the far turn, vied into the lane, weakened in the drive, saved the show. ETBAUER'S IDE settled
 off the pace, moved closest when three wide turning for home, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. PASSING SIMON vied early, fell back, was five
 wide when tiring turning for home. LEAVETHETIP vied early, garnered a larger advantage before a half while off the inside, lost action into the far turn,
 pulled up, vanned off.

 Footnotes
 WILDLY GRAND broke a bit to the outside, stalked the pace outside, moved closer on the outside turning for home, roused right handed when challenging
 nearing the sixteenth pole causing GRANFATHERSLEUGIRL to check up, edged clear late. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE
 RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, WILDLY GRAND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH. SHOULDACOULDAWOULD lacked
 early foot off the inside asked along three wide in the turn, moved out when straightened for home, finished well while out in the strip. BEAUTIFUL BEV with
 the pace from the start just off the inside, dropped to the rail when continuing to vie through the turn, showed the way past midstretch and proved stubborn
 until very late, narrowly lost the second spot. GRANFATHERSLEUGIRL away in good order, set or forced the pace off the inside, was put in tight by the
 winner with a sixteenth remaining, checked up to lose all chance. HALF HEROINE within striking distance along the inside, came up empty for the drive.
 DON'T TELL STACY went one paced throughout in also lacking a closing resposne. AREYOUINABAND broke back, improved position without posing a
 serious threat. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE bothered slightly at the start, failed to menace. TEE NAH NAH broke back and climbed out of the chute when
 appearing to dislike the going, trailed well back, displayed some mild, belated interest down the lane after the issue had been decided. BINDS FAIR LASS
 was finished early.

 Footnotes
 TAP THAT WORD allowed the pace to go early, came in the two path out of the final turn when advancing on the leader, engaged that one soon after and
 wore that same rival down under firm handling. ON CYCLE last away, restrained early, moved out wide first turn, continued well wide in the run up the
 backstretch, roused while still in the four path turning for home, finished with good late energy to be up for the lace. HE'S A SUPER JET forwardly placed
 early while saving ground, advanced up the inside to take over after a half, showed the way through the second turn, gave ground grudgingly to the winner,
 nipped final stride for the place. MONTBROOKS MIRACLE broke alertly, set the pace off the inside, gave up the rail to a rival after four furlongs, began to
 gradually weaken when headed soon after. MUSTANG EDDIE went even ly in lacking a closing response. CHARLIE BALLADO settled in midpack for a half,
 had little for the drive. YONADIXIE remained always back. GASOLINA pressed the issue early from the three path, stopped, jogged in.

 Footnotes
 DR. FRANKIE KAYE restrained early toward the inside, moved out, called on for some run far turn, rallied four wide into the lane, closed with good resolve
 to be up in time. KEEPING TIME broke on top, showed the way down the stretch the first time, well clear midway up the backstretch, shrugged off a rival in
 the far turn, clear again into the stretch, could not contain the winner, remained clear for the place. INSEPARABLE prompted the pace while racing three
 wide, moved closer into the far turn, chased the runner up into the lane, lacked a closing punch. MISS BILLIE K chased the runner up off the inside, moved
 closer between rivals into the far turn, flattened out in the drive. SAFE KEEPING within striking distance for a half inside, came up empty when the real
 running started. RACIN CHRISTINA off a step slow, raced back and wide, made little impact. LADY KING was finished early, no factor. HONEST SMILE
 steadily faded, far back.

 FLYIN ARTIE cleared out of the chute toward the inside, shook off a foe when asked along late in the turn, clear into the lane, held sway while being kept to
 pressure. EIGHT GRAND last to leave, trailed early as a result, angled out four wide exiting the turn, finished willingly to be closing the gap on the winner
 and to edge clear for the second spot. ROCKIN'ROUXS BEST broke out, was straightened to race well back, fanned five wide while being asked turning for
 home, outkicked to the wire for the place. SASSY PANTS SUSIE within striking distance early, fell back early in the turn, went evenly in the drive. JUST A
 BANDIT closest to the winner in the run up the backstretch to that one's outside, lodged a mild and brief bid in the turn, faltered in tghe drive.
 CONSPICUOUS WOMAN saved ground to no avail. STARRY IDE ELAINE void of speed, also saved ground into the lane, lacked room a sixteenth out,
 moved out, too much to do. HER HIGH ROAD floated out at the start, recovered to prompt the pace off the inside, three wide and between rivals into the
 lane, gave way.

 Footnotes
 HEIR OF STORM pressed the early leader from the outside, took over into the far turn, steadily extended that advantage while under pressure through the
 lane. BEN'S MAGIC STONE void of speed for six furlongs, roused three wide into the lane when advancing, could do little with the winner in the drive,
 clearly second best. FANCY THIS settled in the second flight off the inside, crept a bit closer in the three path into the far turn, could not make a further
 advance on the winner nor match the runner up in the drive. MESETA DIABLO last to leave, raced off the pace, four wide through the second turn and
 under pressure, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. SASSY MOE void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a
 threat. BIG MAURICE forwardly placed behind the two leaders for six furlongs, gave way in the far turn. DEVIL'S PAY broke with the winner, narrowly set
 the pace over that one for five furlongs, stopped when headed into the final turn.

 SPEIGHTSONG in the second flight early along the inside, advanced on the two leaders turning for home, lodged a rail bid in upper stretch, long drive to the
 wire, proved best under brisk handling. SCRUTINIZER alternated up front while closest to but not on the inside, allowed the winner the inside entering the
 stretch, outfinished by that one late, proved game for the place. WILD BERT dueled up front in the three path, vied into the lane, outkicked for the place.
 DATA DRIVEN lacked speed, between rivals into the lane, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position. IRRITATOR hesitated at the
 start, raced back and inside, failed to rally. RESILIENCE OF LOVE lacked speed, roused four wide out of the turn, failed to muster a response.

 Footnotes
 DIVINE HOLIDAY with the early pace between rivals, moved out and prompted the issue three through most of the backstretch, put a head in front into the
 far turn, dropped inside and drew off through the lane under a steady hand ride to prove clearly best. RANDY PAUL back off the pace and the inside,
 advanced to be closest to the winner with a four wide move into the far turn, no match drive, held sway for the place. MR. GRACEFUL last to leave,
 continued to race off the pace, staged a mild rally three wide to earn the show. CAP ROCK MINER broke on top, narrowly set the pace for six furlongs, gave
 way when headed far turn. WATCH MY SMOKE pressured the pace while along the inside for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. ACTIF ONE in the
 second flight while between rivals for a half, four wide second turn, lacked a response in the drive.

 Footnotes
 SAMURAI'S PRIZE with the pace from the start, in a bit tight along the inside late first turn, took over along the rail onto the backstretch, clear before a half,
 continued to expand advantage into the stretch, held the runner up comfortably safe late under continued steady handling. MONEY SUNK settled in mid
 pack in the three path early,continued back, four wide rally into the lane, finished willingly for the place, clearly second best. RISEN CORK off the early pace
 and the inside, dropped to the rail far turn, continued in even fashion to the wire to finish best of the rest, no threat top pair. RATATOUILLE narrowly set the
 early pace just off the inside, chased the winner far turn, weakened in the drive to lose a couple of positions. RANGER CONNECTION pressed the issue
 early in the three path, began a gradual fade after four furlongs. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK failed to seriously menace. MYLIE IDEL four wide in the first turn
 outside the runner up, failed to rally. ADIEU MY BABY remained always back. HIGH HOPES DANCE rank early, pulled up after a half, walked back.
