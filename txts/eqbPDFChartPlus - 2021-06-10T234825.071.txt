 TWOFOUR SIX OH ONE fought the rider while being rated under a strong hold in the early stages, set the pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn and
 widened under urging. MEGAN'S MUSE stalked two wide, then pressed the pace, chased on the far turn and was clearly second best. HOPEFAITHJOY
 pulled and was steadied entering the first turn, raced off the pace inside and tired. DAME AMOUR tracked the leaders, lacked a bid and faded. PEGGY
 O'PRADO did not factor and stopped in the stretch.
