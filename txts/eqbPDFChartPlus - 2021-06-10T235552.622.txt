 COCO TIGER quickly went to the front to show the way, responded to looming threat from SHARP DRESSED BEAU at the top of the stretch and held
 safely. SHARP DRESSED BEAU vied three-wide, moved up into striking range, loomed boldly at approaching the stretch but was unable to reach the
 winner. TEN'S LEGACY stalked the pace, shifted out to the three path leaving the turn and lacked a closing response. I PLAY TO WIN offered little. Due to
 a timer malfunction this race was hand timed.

 went in pursuit of the leader but was no match for winner. COMMAND THE LAND prompted from the three path, was unable to move on with the winner and
 chased but was unable to improve contending position. WATCH ME STRUT lacked a serious bid. DA FLASH trailed throughout.

 WESTERN MONGOLIA raced in striking position, responded to urging approaching the stretch run and edged clear late. THORNS N' ROSES reluctant to
 load, reserved off the pacesetters, shifted out late stretch and bested rival for place honors. CAPALLI away well to set the pace, was joined at the top of the
 stretch and weakened late settling for show. FIT FOR ROYALTY saved inside and lacked a closing response that was needed. ULIFTMEOFFMYFEET
 trailed early and lodged a late mild bid. WAVESINTHEOCEAN advanced along the rail leaving the turn and failed to threaten in the drive.

 Footnotes
 DARE TO ENTER stalked the pacesetter from the four path, responded to handling entering the stretch and won driving. WEYAND set a pressured pace,
 was under attack approaching the stretch but was out finished. FIRE THE TRAINER saved on rail and rallied belatedly. STAY GLAD prompted the pace
 from the rail, rallied through the lane but was unable to improve contending position in the stretch. TRUE THOUGHT attended the pace from the three path
 and lacked the rally needed. BEAR FABULOUS SON circled into the lane and was no threat in the drive. TASHREEH trailed throughout.

 MASTER PIP SQUEAK vied for the lead, dueled outside of the eventual winner, was unable to match strides and held for second. BLUEGRASS FUGITIVE
 raced in striking range, gained closer order and just held for show. NUMAANY'S REWARD allowed to settle along the rail, rider lost lines at the top of the
 lane, drifted out and missed for show honors. LINE OF ATTACK sat mid pack and came up empty in the drive. POET SCOUT trailed the field and passed
 tiring foes. DRY ICE chased the pacesetters, stopped and was eased. ZANTANGO never involved.
