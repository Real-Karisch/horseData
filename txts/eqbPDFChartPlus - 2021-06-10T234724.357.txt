 GET TOUGH prompted pace out of first turn, took over at the half and ran away from the field through the stretch run. TIME TRAVELLER mid pack never
 far back, made a four wide run into stretch for the place while never a menace to the winner. BUMPTYBUMPBUMP good speed to the half, overtaken by the
 winner and settled for the show spot. SKYSWEPT raced evenly throughout with no late bid. LEO MEISTER no speed, made a mild middle move to far turn
 but weakened in the stretch run. REALITY was squeezed back at the start and only improved position late. GUNNY ROO through early and dropped back
 readily. SEVENHEARTSWARRIOR never a real threat. JUST ANOTHER JOHN saved ground to no avail. JUST BE FRANK always outrun.

 UNITY caused problems at the start for himself and others, well placed while never far back to the far turn,and edged clear through the stretch run while
 holding sway to the wire. ALBIREO saved ground throughout with a late burst for place and gaining too late. ETERNAL POWER pressed pace to deep
 stretch but gave way grudgingly in the lane. ALDO'S KITTEN had a terrible start then steadied along around the first turn, rallied with a four wide run turn but
 went evenly through the final furlong. ROCKYSHACK speed to the front, pressured to quarter pole and weakened late. SIR YARNALLTON just off pace to
 the half but gave way readily thereafter.

 STEREO VIEWING (IRE) good position early, shuffled back at the half, rallied with a five wide run past the quarter pole and drew clear as much the best.
 SENORA GATO pressed pace to quarter pole, gained a slim lead and battled hard for the place through the stretch run. RILL close up early shuffled back to
 quarter pole but re-rallied and came back widest through the drive. ST. LOUISE unhurried early with a rail run to quarter pole, made a mild bid through the
 stretch but came up empty. SHE BE STRIKING (GB) within striking distance to deep stretch but flattened out in the drive. MAKE MERRY never a real
 threat. SEMANYA good position to quarter pole, bumped hard at that point and backed up into the stretch. CELESTIAL ORB good speed to quarter pole but
 gave way with little resistance.

 Footnotes
 SOUR PEACH stalked the pace early, shifted into the four path in the far turn, drove past the leader in the stretch and drew off late under a steady drive.
 MILEVA set the pace early, angled off the rail into the lane, faltered late in the stretch and was no match for the winner but second best. HAUTE
 PROSPECT lunged at the start and raced back early on, was on the inside into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. VENEZUELANTREASURE
 chased the pace early, shifted into the three path in the far turn and leveled off late in the stretch drive. MANY FACES chased the pace early, shifted into the
 four path in the far turn and faded late in the stretch. HYPERSPACE came out at the start and was no factor. SARK LADY was bumped and bothered at the
 start. PLAY FOR PLAY had early speed then eased down the lane.
