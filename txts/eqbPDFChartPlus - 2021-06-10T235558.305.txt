 WICKED AMBER three then two wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside
 and was forced to alter out a path near the eighth pole as STRIKE MAGIC got carried out by PINK PEPPERMINT to the inside, closed well to take
 command a sixteenth out coming in slightly under an off sided stick, got corrected and edged away to the finish to prevail. HENNI PENNY just off the inside
 early on in mid pack, tipped three wide forcing HONOR BELLE to the four or five path at the nine-sixteenths, tucked back to the two path into the turn, came
 under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to share in the place honors on the wire. PINK
 PEPPERMINT just off the inside near the rear, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, cut the corner into
 upper stretch, angled out and then altered five to six paths nearing the eighth pole carrying out STRIKE MAGIC and forcing WICKED AMBER to alter a path
 as the pair of FAIRY DIVA and SPLASHERSTOWN shied and steadied in front, then briefly paused near the sixteenth marker as WICKED AMBER came
 inwards slightly while offering up a mild bid to share in the place honors. TOASTNJAM tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside at the
 seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in and was
 collared a sixteenth out, then got outfinished in the late stages. STRIKE MAGIC stumbled at the start conceding only a length to the front, tracked the pace
 along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was carried out five
 to six paths by PINK PEPPERMINT near the eighth pole paused in hand and in turn forcing WICKED AMBER to alter a path out as well and lost position as
 a result, then kept on to the finish. SPLASHERSTOWN dueled two then three wide with SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON to her inside, came under coaxing
 near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command holding narrow advantage and shied out under a
 near sided stick forcing FAIRY DIVA to steady in behind near the eighth pole and again at that station when yielding the front in turn forcing PINK
 PEPPERMINT to continue outwards carrying out STRIKE MAGIC , then weakened in the late stages. FAIRY DIVA (GB) five paths off the inside down the
 backstretch in pursuit from just off the duel, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
 stretch, dug in under a drive and was forced to steady nearing the eighth pole as the aforementioned foe shied out, steadied once more at that station as
 that rival continued outwards, went to alter in and steadied a third time as HENNI PENNY went on by in the inside lane and weakened in the late going to
 the finish unable to get going once more. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON stumbled at the start conceding about a length to the front before being coaxed
 along inside to advance and knock heads with SPLASHERSTOWN to her outside, took to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. HONOR BELLE chased three wide
 early on and was forced to alter out four to five wide at the nine-sixteenths as HENNI PENNY tipped out in front three wide at that station, tucked back three
 wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. There was a Stewards' Inquiry
 into the stretch run as well as a pair of Jockey Objections. There was a claim of foul by the rider of STRIKE MAGIC alleging interference against PINK
 PEPPERMINT in the stretch as well as a claim of foul by the rider of FAIRY DIVA alleging interference against SPLASHERSTOWN at the eighth pole. After
 review, the Objection against PINK PEPPERMINT was dismissed and SPLASHERSTOWN was disqualified from sixth and placed seventh having been
 deemed to have interfered with FAIRY DIVA prior to the race being declared official.

 Footnotes
 FULL SALUTE retained the advantage after narrowly out-breaking the competition, cut over towards the inside route, showed the way, pulling on the left
 and with the second place in attendance in path two, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and was asked for more, emerged a sixteenth down the road
 holding what turned out to be his largest lead, saw its fellow in-the-money finishers close in so much so as to loom boldly late, dug in well to reach the wire
 in time. THOUSAND PERCENT was rated along pressing the winner for the opening half from path two settled in upper stretch and was given his cue,
 gained ground in a steadfast manner, missed. THE SICARII stayed along the inside route after the field had been sent on its way, got switched over to
 urging after departing the backstretch, proceeded to angle to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, wound up towards the three path a furlong later, closed
 in well in the final stages, fell short. DEEP SEA pursued the front runners from path two, undertaking the task from between rivals during the most of the
 journey leading up to the five-sixteenths marker, stepped into the lane and lacked the necessary response. SWIPING DAN got sent over to the inside well
 before reaching the conclusion of the backstretch, stayed put to the end of the bend, was moved out into path four from upper to midlahne, made no impact.
 HARDCORE FOLKLORE three wide onto and afterwards off of the turn, had no rally. DARK N CLOUDY squeezed at the start, travelled from path three on
 the turn, shifted out into the five path during the initial portion of the stretch, never made his presence felt.

 MO MAVERICK away in good order, went at it one on one with FAST GETAWAY during the initial stages, with neither pace participant being under any sort
 of brisk encouragement, saw the previously-mentioned rival back off, got guided over to the inside route, showed the way, rated and with CALL ME HARRY
 in accompaniment in the two path, began to edge away during the final stages of the run around the bend, came up to the three-sixteenths pole and was
 turned loose, scampered away to a comfortable lead, had the pilot correctly judge the contest for all practical purposes over well inside the sixteenth pole
 and got geared down in the final forty yards. SHIRAZ made it onto the inside route on the backstretch, cut the corner under a drive, went on to secure
 second. FAST GETAWAY having suffered no ill effects after some light contact with BOURBON MISSION in the shadow of the starting gate, vied for the top
 matched up with the winner, was eased back, content for the pocket trip that was to follow, got cued up as the half was being completed, tip out into the two
 path for the drive home, got outfinished. CALL ME HARRY pressed the winner from the two path for a good portion of the opening half before giving way.
 LE GENERAL lunged out after striking the right side of the starting gate, got going, underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, angled out five wide from
 upper to midlane, rallied mildly. DISCRETIONARY MARQ three wide onto the turn, was ridden one path wider exiting it, had no rally. BOURBON MISSION
 brushed with FAST GETAWAY right after the start, moved inward, departing the backstretch from the two path, went out into the four path once into the
 stretch, made no impact. MO DIDDLEY came out, making solid contact with its next stall neighbor twice, settled into midpack, raced two wide on the turn,
 commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, gave way. HONORABLE HERO pinched at the start, raced from off the inside throughout, brought up
 the back of the pack stationed in the three path on the turn, fanned out into path six during the early going of the stretch run, was never in it. KOSCIUSZKO
 bumped twice with MO DIDDLEY at the start, in each instance with some force, failed to make his presence off the ground-saving journey that followed.

 SECRET RULES hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under growing
 threat through the final furlong, his main rival getting on near even terms a sixteenth from home and gamely persevered to get a neck in front nearing the
 finish to prevail. FLATTER ME bumped at the start by EXTREME FORCE who recovered out from a bobble, chased three wide in aim of the leader, came
 under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong getting on near even
 terms at the sixteenth marker, dug in shying out under a near sided stick slightly to the finish and was ultimately rebuffed on the wire while well clear of the
 rest. ALWAYS MISBEHAVING stumbled at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
 and weakened in the final furlong while along for the show honors. EXTREME FORCE bobbled at the break and recovered into FLATTER ME, chased just
 off the inside until tucked to the rail at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the
 stretch. PINE KNOLL bobbled at the break, chased four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, came under a ride at the
 three-eighths, went three to four wide for home and tired. MENELIK forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn,
 came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

 BOURBON IN MAY made it over to the rail well before departing the homestretch, was patiently ridden tracking the front runners, waited briefly behind
 MOHICAN for the last few jumps leading up to the quarter pole, saw that foe shift into path two at the head of the stretch and proceeded to slip by, still
 hugging the rail, got cued up altering course into the three path between the three-sixteenths pole the furlong marker, exploded to the top at the latter
 station, then drew off smartly, kept to vigorous encouragement. BRAY strung out three wide on both turns, commenced the stretch one wider, straightened
 away and rallied for the place. STARTING POINT grabbed the advantage shortly after the field had been released, got guided over to the inside route,
 showed the way, lightly pressed and appearing keen, was put to a drive approaching the end of the second bend, proved no match when confronted by the
 top one deep into the furlong grounds, weakened late and lost the place. WILLING TO SPEED two wide during the initial stages, was along the rail on the
 far turn, steadied just behind the ultimate winner in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, stepped into the lane and launched a mild rally good
 enough for the last major check. MOHICAN stalked STARTING POINT from path two before tucking along the rail midway on the backstretch, continued
 along it after departing the backstretch, was maneuvered back into path two at the top of the lane, came up empty. WHERE'S RUDY quickly spotted along
 the inside route, made no impact. HARDEST PART (GB) two to three wide for over three-quarters, gave way. TANGLED WEB forwardly placed three for six
 furlongs, folded.

 FULLY VESTED just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing tipped out nearing the quarter
 pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, stacking outside the top pair, took over command straightened away for home, went clear under a drive kept
 to task to the finish. VICI broke in a step at the start bumping DUBINI, chased three to four wide down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, tucked to
 the two path into the turn and advanced to press that rival through the bend, got set down between foes spinning just off the inside for home, proved no
 match for the top one while running on to just preserve the place honors on the wire. LONHTWIST brushed at the start by JAMMER, settled two to three
 wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, closed well in the late stages to
 secure the show honors at the finish. GIDU (IRE) established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift
 splits, tucked inside into the turn, came under increasing pressure from VICI to the outside from the three-eighths, got joined three deep by the eventual
 winner near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch roused for the drive, got displaced in tandem with VICI from command straightened away, dug
 in knocking heads to the finish with VICI keeping on to the finish but was outfinished in the last jumps. DUBINI bumped at the start by VICI who broke in a
 step, chased three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid closing in
 concert with LONHTWIST until the sixteenth marker, then flattened out in the late going. NICE TUNE three to four wide in pursuit from the tail of the field,
 came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. JAMMER chased just off the inside put
 to coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 PERFORMER away well, worked out a tuck onto the inside route coming up to the crown of the clubhouse bend, kept to it as CARLOS L. was shortly
 thereafter assuming the top, abandoned it by tipping into the two path entering the backstretch, ranged up to the leader, was in hand taking over at
 three-quarters was being completed, went back to the rail once sufficiently in the clear to do so, cut the corner into the stretch with TAX lurking dangerously
 in the two path, settled in and was given his cue, saw a spirited tussle get ignited with the aforementioned rival as that foe clawed its way forward, begin the
 final furlong still clutching the lead, yielded no further and instead edged away again, was under vigorous encouragement crossing the finish line. TAX
 remained along the rail after the start, was patiently ridden tracking the pacesetter, inched his way to the outside as the third fraction was being finalized,
 picked up interest and after knifing its way into the two path, split rivals in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, turned into the lane and got turned
 loose coming up to the three-sixteenths pole, chipped away at the deficit, made no addition progress and ultimately had to settle for place honors. GRUMPS
 LITTLE TOTS sat forwardly placed three wide, swung into the lane and gave way. EN WYE CEE shied in at the start, was sighted taking up the chase from
 path two on each bend, but was in the middle of strip during the trip between them, got roused as three-quarters was being reeled, moved out four wide
 racing down the lane, made no headway. CARLOS L. reluctant to load, broke sharply, worked his way to the front end on the first turn, tucked along the rail
 at the top of the backstretch, showed the way rated along, got headed by the winner at the three-eighths pole, stayed prominently placed for a little while
 longer before faltering. MUBARMAJ pursued the pace from path two until the end of the backstretch, tipped into path four for the run around the second
 bend, came into the lane and backed away. AIR ATTACK put to a hand ride out of the gate, made it over to the rail in short order, sat isolated from the
 others at the back of the pack, failed to pick it up when asked to at the midway point of the far turn, was not making headway when taken hold of at the
 three-sixteenths pole, allowed to fade away thereafter.

 SI QUE ES BUENA (ARG) saved ground near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the
 corner into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, was in behind a pair of rivals and used the infield chute gap to circumvent that traffic scraping
 the paint paused at the eighth pole briefly inside of PIVOTAL CONNECTION before issuing a challenge to the leader, rallied up the rail to take command a
 sixteenth from home, dug in under a drive and held on at the finish from a late surging rival. MY SISTER NAT (FR) saved ground at the tail of the field
 through the early stages before taking to the two path down the backstretch, tipped three wide at the three-eighths, came under coaxing near the
 five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and offered up a good finish closing stoutly outside but missed at the end. DECORATING coaxed
 from the gate to establish the front, showed the way under rating just off the inside through the first turn accompanied by ROMANTIC PURSUIT to the
 outside, took to the inside the initial time past the stands, remained patiently handled under watch by her escort to the outside through to near the quarter
 pole, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fending off a host and drifted out under a near sided stick just inside the eighth pole, got
 collared a sixteenth from home and fought on to the finish to preserve the show honors. PIVOTAL CONNECTION (GB) three wide through the first turn,
 tucked to the inside seven and a half furlongs from home and tracked from just off the pace in hand, remained patiently handled along the inside until roused
 cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive, got brushed by the eventual winner skimming up the rail a furlong out, dug in battled on to the
 wire. EMPRESSOF THE NILE settled two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper
 stretch, offered up a mild kick but was outfinished in the late stages. MERCILLA saved ground in the early going before taking to the two path down the
 backstretch, chased three wide through the far turn placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive offering up
 a mild bid but was outkicked to the finish. LIFT UP just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
 into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. WEGETSDAMUNNYS just off the inside near the rear, tipped out four wide at the five-eighths,
 remained four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, went six wide into upper stretch, made mild progress outside but
 was outkicked. ROMANTIC PURSUIT bobbled slightly at the break and came under coaxing to be forwardly placed, attended the leader from the outside in
 the three path through the first turn and past the stands until tucked to the two path seven furlongs from home, remained patiently handled applying little
 pressure save her presence until nearing the quarter pole, came under coaxing at that juncture, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in
 under a drive in contention to the eighth pole, stayed on one paced to the finish. HOMELAND SECURITY tracked just off the inside from mid pack, got
 steadied in tight between foes at the three-eighths losing some minor position, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into
 upper stretch, dug in under a drive to the eighth pole, got paused in behind rivals briefly a sixteenth out and was outkicked. ENTROPIA (ARG) broke out at
 the start and took over the lane of MY SISTER NAT briefly, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
 the inside for home and weakened. MORE FUN AGAIN just off the pace two to three wide, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into
 upper stretch and weakened in the drive.

 CALL THE CAT loped along the rail for the opening half, worked his way into the five path in two stages during the opening half of the stretch run, kicked
 into his best with approximately a sixteenth to go, gaining ground readily, got up with a few jumps to spare before the finish line. ELIOS MILOS initially took
 up the chase three wide on the turn, shouldered its way into the four path at the expense of JOHNNY WISHBONE right around the five-sixteenths pole,
 challenged in earnest entering the stretch, took charge during the ensuing furlong, offered resistance as the winner was closing in late, got caught. QUEST
 FOR FIRE reserved two wide for the initial half, swung out four wide for the drive home, rallied for the show. BRONXVILLE responded to a light hand early
 to establish the top, cut over to the inside, carved out the pace, pressed by TIZANOXBOW from the outside, turned into the lane and was turned loose,
 yielded to ELIOS MILOS at the furlong grounds, stayed weakened thereafter, but managed to hold on to the final significant slice of the purse. TALENT
 SCOUT worked out a tuck into the two path approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, was on the move to the outside heading home, wandered out six
 wide racing down the lane, rallying all the while, but only mildly. TIZANOXBOW pressed the issue from the two until the furlong grounds before giving way.
 MAC'S REVOLUTION made his way towards the inside along the backstretch, went on to track the pace while straddling the right rim of the inside route,
 was on hold briefly in traffic late on the bend, stepped into the lane, came up empty after getting asked for more. JOHNNY WISHBONE four wide onto the
 turn, was nudged into path five by the second place finisher after crossing the midway mark on the turn, went into the lane and had no offering. OUR
 AMERICAN STAR sent over to the rail shortly after the start, failed to menace.
