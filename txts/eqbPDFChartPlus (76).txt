 Footnotes
 BEAST MODE ducked out at the start, was quickly righted to track outside foes off the second flight racing to the turn, steadily advanced four wide nearing
 upper stretch to challenge for command, then took over and went clear under energetic handling. ENDGAME sprinted to the lead along the inside, held
 sway on a clear margin into upper stretch, proved no match when confronted by the winner but was best of the others. EL PRINCIPE I B tracked off the
 second flight between foes in the opening stages, shifted out to bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, switched out five wide in the lane and
 continued well enough to prevail for a share. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the turn but couldn't produce the
 needed closing bid. JOHNNY CHADDA was settled last, angled out six wide in upper stretch but made no impression. ZESTY STORM, forwardly placed
 four wide in the opening stages, shifted in pursuing the pacesetter into the stretch but came up empty entering the lane. CAST A STONE vied briefly
 between foes racing to the turn but emptied out early.

 Footnotes
 LAPIS STORM broke sharply to gain a narrow advantage, dictated the pace racing a bit off the rail and held sway through the lane under spirited handling.
 KENAI COOL tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing into the bend, continued with a steady effort while failing to gain terms with that rival but
 was best of the others. HER NAME IS UM tracked just off the pacesetter inside a rival racing into the turn, shifted off the rail in upper stretch but lacked the
 needed final kick. TOMASITA was settled outside foes, angled out entering the lane but lacked a rally. ANNIE TIME GIRL, caught in close quarters in the
 opening stages, was prompted to gain a position off the second flight while angling inwards racing into the turn but lacked a closing response. TRACK
 MAGIC, caught in close quarters in the opening stages, settled along the inside and soon dropped out.

 VOLUPTUOUS, a bit rank in the opening stages, tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing three deep to the backstretch, continued outside a
 rival in the second bend, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm
 encouragement. BACK PAGE STAR tracked off the second flight while angling inwards a bit racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide in upper stretch
 and finished with interest to edge rivals for the place honors late. FRINGE tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, saved ground to
 upper stretch and edged a rival for a share on the wire. LUCKY AT JUSTICE tracked the pace inside foes in second flight, shifted out racing into upper
 stretch, steadied a bit in close quarters leaving midstretch and just missed for a share. REAL DE JALPA tracked off the second flight between foes to the far
 turn, shifted out racing through the stretch and continued with a mild bid. CHLOBEE settled inside foes in the last flight early, saved ground to upper stretch
 and improved position inside foes late. WILDWOOD SCAT was settled last, split foes racing into upper stretch, shifted wide in the lane and made some
 belated progress. MAGIC FEET settled off the second flight racing three deep between foes to the backstretch and lacked a rally. BAHAMA KITTEN, urged
 to terms prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue through the far turn to upper stretch but gave way in late stages. HIDE AND STREET, urged to the fore
 outside foes, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled into upper stretch and emptied out.
 SUNSET GABLES, caught four wide racing through the first turn, retreated early.

 MISTER CHARMING was urged to prompt the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, went clear after a half, shifted a bit off the inside while
 contesting a rival's challenge racing into the far turn, dispatched that rival, then gamely turned back a bid from CANARY ISLANDS in the closing stages to
 narrowly prevail under left handed encouragement. The latter tracked off the first flight three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to
 striking distance after a half, continued under patient handling while shifting to the inside on the far turn, swung outside the leaders while being roused to
 challenge in upper stretch, struck the front late but was outfinished. ENJOY THE JOURNEY, caught four wide racing through the first turn, advanced outside
 foes in that path to challenge for command racing into the far turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch but flattened out nearing the furlong marker. DON
 CURLIONE was settled inside rivals in the opening stages, switched out entering the far turn to improve position between rivals in the lane but was no real
 threat. ENUMCLAW, urged to prompt the pace inside a rival from the outset to the backstretch, gave way after a half. COCKALORUM was settled three
 deep between foes, then outside rivals in the last flight in the opening half, was fanned four wide racing into the lane but lacked a rally.

 Footnotes
 PROBABLY GRACE was prompted to gain a forward position outside foes while shifting inwards in the opening stages, commenced a sharp, three wide
 advance racing into turn to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, took over entering the lane and steadily widened the advantage under firm hand
 urging and a few right handed taps. LA NEGRA NOCHE tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight, made steady progress through the
 turn in that path to prove best of the others late. TALK NICE sprinted clear of the field from the break while angling sharply to the inside racing through the
 backstretch, dueled for command into upper stretch but couldn't match the winner while losing the place honors late. GIRL FROM BERLIN was rated seven
 wide in the opening quarter, advanced four, then five wide into upper stretch and continued to gain position to the end. STRONG MANDY, unhurried inside
 foes tracking off the second flight early, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an even effort. RAY'S SILVER STORM, forwardly placed along
 the inside tracking just off the leaders, shifted out in upper stretch and faded in late stages. RUBIETTA BLUES, brushed start, switched outside rivals early,
 angled six wide racing into the lane but had no rally. RED CARPET hopped at the break, was held up momentarily when caught in close quarters and never
 gained contention. WICKET HOPE tracked off the second flight racing five wide between foes to the turn and lacked a rally. MIMI'S AWESOME was brief
 factor between foes in second flight but retreated early. NO PASSING ZONE raced six wide between foes in the last flight but dropped out early.

 WAKE UP JOE, switched outside a rival in the opening stages while being prompted to secure the lead, shifted to the rail dictating the pace on a narrow
 margin racing into the turn, dispatched several rivals after a half, then gamely turned back the late challenge of LEE'S LUCK in the final stages under firm
 left handed encouragement. The latter broke sharply, then angled quickly to the rail, tracked just off the leaders along the inside racing into the bend, shifted
 to challenge just outside the pacesetter nearing midstretch, struck the front between calls late but was just outfinished. HAWK'S IMAGE settled off the
 leaders near the inside racing into the bend, shifted off the inside to split foes in upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. MATCH
 PLAY tracked off the first flight outside foes racing four wide into the turn, then upper stretch but offered no rally. TOUCH OF DISNEY, urged to gain a
 forward placing between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, pressed the issue between foes through the turn and gave way in upper stretch. PEACOCK
 MAN tracked the pacesetter outside foes in early stages, lodged a brief, three wide bid nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out.

 Footnotes
 READTHECLIFFNOTES, caught a bit wide racing into the first turn while under prompting to gain a forward placing, moved to terms with a rival attending
 that foe's pace in the opening half, pressed the issue into the far turn, was headed nearing midstretch but responded to firm left handed pressure to regain
 the advantage in time in a game effort. CITALI tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, shifted to the inside after a half, steadily gathered
 momentum while angling three wide racing into upper stretch challenging for command, gained a narrow advantage midstretch but couldn't put the winner
 away. SKYCRAFT, brushed at the start, was guided to the inside early dropping off the second flight, shifted outside foes racing into upper stretch, was
 fanned five wide avoiding a drifting rival in late stages but finished with interest to edge a rival for a share. DOMIKATE was rated off the second flight along
 the inside in the opening half, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch to challenge but finished evenly in the final stages. BAROQUE sped to the fore
 along the inside racing into the backstretch, dueled for command racing into the far turn, gave way in upper stretch and drifted out through the last furlong.
 THE ROUGE DIESEL settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. PISTOL BOX was settled outside foes
 racing to the backstretch, dropped out last and failed to menace. MIRACLE MOUNTAIN switched off the inside tracking off the first flight in the opening half
 and steadily faded racing into the far turn.

 Footnotes
 GO VO, forwardly placed five deep in the opening stages tracking a rival's pace, shifted inwards entering the bend advancing with an early move to gain a
 clear advantage midway through the turn, continued a bit off the inside into the lane but held sway on a clear margin to the end under firm right handed
 pressure. SUPERSTAR LEO tracked just off the leaders four wide between foes in the opening quarter, continued with a steady bid in that path to upper
 stretch but proved only second best. COUNTRY COOL broke outwards at the start bumping MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET and forcing that rival into the path of
 FLEETWAY, was righted to track just inside the pacesetter on the backstretch, continued along the inside into the stretch and finished evenly to prevail for a
 share. BOOTLEGGIN settled outside foes in early stages, shifted out four wide racing into the lane and made some belated progress to gain position.
 MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET, bumped, then squeezed between rivals at the start, was collected to track off the second flight inside rivals into the turn and
 finished evenly. STEALIN' SUMMER was settled near the inside racing into the bend and failed to menace. FLEETWAY, bumped from both sides and
 knocked back at the start, switched outside foes racing into the turn, then was fanned wide into the stretch while proving no threat. WAR GENERAL TOO
 was a brief factor three wide between foes but faded early. DR. LIECHTY broke inwards bumping FLEETWAY, was collected, then flashed brief pace
 between foes racing to the turn and emptied out into the stretch.
