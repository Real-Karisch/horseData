 Footnotes
 DEVIL'S DRAMA was void of speed early on, raced along the outside, moved to the rail inside the five sixteenths pole, was on the inside into the lane,
 rallied down the lane from the inside and drove clear in the final stages. LAND GRANT vied for the lead early on, took over, was off the rail into the lane, led
 from between horses down the lane but yielded late in the drive. DAVIDIC LINE was bumped and bothered at the start, chased the pace early, was off the
 rail into the lane, made a bid four wide down the lane and moved up in the late stages. WE'RE STILL HERE vied for the lead early on, shifted into the three
 path in the turn, made a bid three wide down the lane but weakened late in the drive. COURT SKY stalked the pace early, shifted into the four path in the
 turn while making a bid but faded late in the stretch run. GAME SET AND MATCH trailed the field early on, fanned into the five path in the turn and
 improved position down the lane. AMERICAIN JOEY veered out at the start and bothered multiple foes, was no threat thereafter. JOHN'S ROCK had early
 speed then folded up. REVVED was bothered at the start and through after a half. AUSTRIAN was through early.
