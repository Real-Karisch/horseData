 Footnotes
 MARS CURIOSITY bobbled after the start but recovered immediately, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the turn,
 took the lead at the three-sixteenths, drifted out some under a left-handed whip into the final furlong, dueled with the runner-up in the final sixteenth and
 gamely prevailed under strong urging. GUNTHER chased the pace from third, rounded the turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch, made an
 outside bid at the furlong marker, dueled with the winner in the final furlong and was denied while clear for the place. SKYLAS GOLD set the pace under
 pressure, was urged along against the rail on the turn, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong then weakened
 but just held the show. PLASKA settled near the middle of the field, was roused while four wide on the turn, came under the whip outside the furlong marker
 and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. YANKEE GAMBLER was forced out at the start then bumped with a rival, raced towards the rear
 while urged along, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. MADE ME TALK settled off
 the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to outside the sixteenth-pole, altered course to the outside and
 failed to threaten. PRINCE BING bumped with a rival after the start, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the
 stretch, lacked room coming to the eighth-pole, shifted to the outside from behind horses and was no factor. VALID DECISION broke out at the start then
 was hustled, went three wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. HIYA KID was urged along off the pace, saved
 ground on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty.

 Footnotes
 WITT SEVEN saved ground on the first turn, was well placed near the inside, went two then three wide on the far turn, rallied into upper stretch, closed
 strongly to get the lead near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under a strong hand ride. SURE THING SHEILA went three wide on the first turn, tracked
 the pace, took the lead at the three-eighths then moved clear in the two path on the far turn, dropped to the rail turning into the stretch, drifted in passing the
 chute and was overtaken while clear for the place. JOYOUS EVELYN went around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, raced four wide
 while urged along on the far turn and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. AFTERIMAGE went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace,
 moved closer late on the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn, moved to the two path turning into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong
 and tired. GIO POINT settled on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, moved to the two path near the quarter-pole, swung four wide into the stretch
 and failed to threaten. WINGS OF SILVER went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn
 and came up empty. GLITTER BRIGHT went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was taken up early on the far turn, went three wide
 on that bend, steadied behind horses at the furlong marker and was no factor. MULA STALKER went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the inside
 of a rival, rounded the far turn in the two path, steadied behind horses at the furlong marker and never reached contention. REJOICE AN BE GLAD was
 taken up a tad early, went four to five wide on the turns and failed to respond. DYNA ON A MISSION went four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed
 down the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the far turn and tired. DIMES FROM HEAVEN traveled around the first turn in the two path, set the
 pace, was headed at the three-eighths, came up empty while inside on the far turn and stopped.
