 margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the second turn, held a clear margin at the eighth pole but shortened stride
 late. OHMYMY OHMYYES stalked the early pace from the outside, crept closer entering the second turn, responded but was no match late while best of the
 rest. GRAND ARGUMENT allowed to settle early, advanced inside through the second turn, responded and had a late rally. KING FORMEREDITH could
 only improve position. WATCHOUTFOR TAYLOR chased the early pace inside but came up empty in the drive. E PORTO was no factor. CAJUN CASH
