 Footnotes
 KIT CHECK leaned in at the start bumping AIR FORCE CADET, was reserved, advanced on the far turn and offered a steady four bid to prevail. SECRET
 LIFE STYLE attended the pace, wore down his chief rival late but could not contain the winning bid. GOT MOJO set a contested pace along the rail and dug
 in for the stretch run late. DREAM BABY DREAM never menaced. AIR FORCE CADET bumped at the start, raced forwardly while four wide and lacked a
 rally. HAULIN' FREIGHT was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 LANGS LEGEND prompted the pace, took over on the turn and drew off in the stretch. ROOSTER BAY saved ground, posed no threat and stayed on.
 DESANCTUS raced forwardly while four wide, continued four wide into the stretch and kept on. CHEROKEE CHARLIE passed tired ones. RICKSHAW
 EXPRESS gained a narrow early lead, was challenged on the turn and gave way. GALAXY'S WILDCAT was always outrun. GUNTOTER showed little.
