 Footnotes
 DONA BIANCA allowed to settle, shifted out to the five-path, gained the lead late in the far turn and remained clear under light handling. ANGELS SING
 trailed early, advanced outside at the quarter pole, continued a steady bid and captured place. SOPHISTICATED SARA stalked the pacesetter, rallied mildly
 through the far turn, lacked the kick needed through the lane and was denied place but finished best of the others. SPARKLING CHOICE saved ground
 while setting the pace, was unable to keep pace with the field and faded steadily inside. ANNIE'SLITTLEANGEL settled three-wide in the opening stages
 and dropped back. CHRIS TINA B saved inside and was finished early.

 Footnotes
 KVOTHE settled in range from between rivals, shifted out four-wide into the backstretch, hustled three-wide into the stretch and kicked by. GOTTA GET
 LUCKY prompted the pace, moved up alongside LIVE A LITTLE to challenge the lead, dueled into the final turn, was bumped repeatedly at the top of the
 stretch, roused forward and was ran down late stretch. LIVE A LITTLE set the pace under a snug hold, responded to challenge from GOTTA GET LUCKY,
 bumped outside rival in the final turn, gave way inside, steadied and held on for show. CONQUEST HOT HUMOR stalked the pacesetters from the three
 path, raced widest through the backstretch, responded to heavy steady urging and was unable to improve contending position through the drive. KISSIN
 DANCER was reserved off the pacesetters, tracked inside and was done early. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of LIVE A LITTLE
 against the rider of GOTTA GET LUCKY alleging interference at the top of the stretch was not allowed.

 backstretch and finished evenly. OUR DANDY'S BOY dismounted rider in gate, lagged early, gained closer order and failed to threaten in the drive. BUD
 TIME offered little. JOVIAL DESTINY lacked a bid.

 Footnotes
 JAYA HO quickly took command, was remained uncontested at the quarter pole, rider checked under shoulder mid stretch and was geared down late.
 FLATTERING LIFE unhurried early, advanced quickly outside in the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch but was no match for the winner through the
 stretch. THE GREY ONE raced in closest pursuit, chased hard leaving the backstretch but was unable to reach the eventual winner and held firm for show.
 IS IT GOLD raced four-wide leaving the first turn, advanced position racing three to four-wide and flattened through the stretch. YZITMYFAULT failed to
 menace. FLORIST hopped leaving, saved ground and failed to produce a bid. BEARDINI passed tiring foe. BEACH PREMIER hustled away, tracked the
 leader inside and faded steadily.

 SLEIGH RIDE settled mid pack inside, angled out to the three path entering the far turn, swept the lead and drew off. ALPHAGATE shuffled back in the first
 turn, hustled five-wide leaving the backstretch, chased from the two path, was gaining late but needed more and proved clear second best. CANDY ALLEY
 fanned three-wide into the first turn, gained closer order and rallied mildly for show. HOTALING HEART saved ground and closed belatedly. SANTANA'S
 GIRL was forwardly placed racing three-wide through the backstretch and yielded through the lane. THIS IS MY NIGHT trailed and passed tiring foes.
 POP'S LITTLE GIRL sprinted to the lead, was quickly overtaken late in the final turn and faltered. SIMPLY FABLUS hurried away, checked in the opening
 turn, prompted from between rivals and was done early.

 Footnotes
 LONG TIME DON stalked the pacesetters from between rivals, angled out to the three path, gained a narrow lead at the quarter pole, drew off into the
 stretch, was showing signs of tiring late but had enough cushion to hold safely. UNCLE GRUMPY lacked early foot, came under coaxing in the far turn
 racing four-wide and closed well but needed more for impact. PINEDA fanned three-wide, pressured the pace, rallied between rivals, joined MANDELA
 FEVER mid stretch matching strides and won the nod. MANDELA FEVER hustled away, emerged the leader entering the backstretch, took pressure inside
 of PINEDA, came under a ride into the drive and rallied determinedly inside and was denied share by the nod. INCLUDING GOLD trailed the field early,
 shifted out to the three path upper stretch and failed to menace in the drive. RIQQA broke awkwardly, breaking inward, moved up into contending position,
 race wide through the far turn and lacked a closing response. TALK THE WALK tracked inside and faded gradually. PAKAL fanned four-wide in the opening
 turn, moved up four-wide to press the issue and stopped.

 Footnotes
 CHISUM G was reserved off the pacesetters, took closer order, swung five to six-wide at the top of the stretch and responded to steady right-handed urging
 and got by in time. FIRST ROUND DRAFT was strung five-wide through the first turn, advanced steadily outside, gained a narrow lead and was worn down
 from prolonged pressure. WILKO SAY WHAT broke inward, carried FIRST ROUND DRAFT wide through the first turn, moved up to tracked the pacesetters,
 roused forward then was steadied mid stretch and was along in time for show. GEE FOR THREE rated just off the pace, moved up alongside TRIPPI
 RIVER MAN to challenge the lead, dueled into the far turn, gained a short advantage into the stretch and gave way late. RUN AWAY LANE offered a late
 mild bid. DASHER saved and was roused to no avail. TRIPPI RIVER MAN broke alertly, responded to challenge from GEE FOR THREE, was unable to
 match strides with the fore mentioned into the stretch and retreated. A GUY CALLED SUE saved to no avail. SOLVANG squeezed away from the gate then
 was in tight in the first turn and tired.

 Footnotes
 TIMELY PRIZE sat in striking position in the three path, quickly overtook the leaders at the three eighths pole, drew off into the stretch then held under a late
 drive and was vanned off after the race. NORM'S PLACE stalked the pacesetters, angled out to the four path leaving the backstretch, chased the leader into
 the stretch, was gaining late but was unable to get to the winner. KODIAK KING raced at the back of the pack, gained closer order at the quarter pole,
 circled into the stretch and closed late getting up for show honors. ROCKY ROYALE fanned four to five-wide in the first turn, moved up closer racing
 four-wide into the far turn, chased hard through the stretch and was collared late for show. DONNA'S BOY fanned three-wide, hustled through traffic at the
 quarter pole and lacked the rally needed. SMART COPY strung wide through the first turn, was set down for a drive at the top of the lane, gained then
 evened out. SPECIAL KISS saved early, cut corner into the stretch and failed to threaten in the drive. BLAZINGULCH moved up to contested the early
 pace, was quickly overtaken at the three eighths pole and dropped back. BEAR'S REALITY was in tight in the first turn then was done early and eased.
 HOLLER AT THE MOON broke alertly, quickly went to the front to secured a rail position, was overtaken, retreated and was eased.
