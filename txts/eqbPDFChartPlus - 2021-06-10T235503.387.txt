 Footnotes
 STEVES EVEN raced in pursuit of the top two through the turn while three wide, bid from the three or four path into the lane, cleared near the
 three-sixteenths pole and held. CORBIN raced in the back through the turn when not far back and in the two path, came into the lane from the two or three
 path, was blocked near the sixteenth pole, shifted out and finished with good energy to gain the place spot. BROTHER WINSLOW was bumped at the start,
 raced in contention from the three path through the turn while in behind the pacesetters, tipped into the four path at the top of the lane then did not show the
 necessary closing response while missing the place spot. MUNY ME TOO was in the four to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five
 path then offered a mild gain. STRONG IMAGE bobbled to the inside at the start bumping his stablemate, pressed the pace two wide through the turn, led in
 late turn then gave way straightening in the lane. ROYAL BANK was never a serious factor while weakening along the inside. SWIFT PUNCH vied for the
 lead while off the inside through the turn, alternated leads into the lane then was empty.

 Footnotes
 OPERATION STEVIE trailed into and through the turn while moving from the two to the four path in late turn, came into the lane from the five or six path
 with considerable momentum, caught the leader inside the eighth pole and quickly cleared. MR MANNING cleared on the lead early from the two path, was
 under pressure into the lane, repelled that challenger inside the eighth pole then was no match for the winner while keeping on for the place spot.
 FLOWERPECKER was along the inside while tracking the pacesetters into the turn, briefly steadied near the three-eighths pole, continued near the rail into
 the lane, shifted into the four path inside the eighth pole and moved up a spot. CALANDAVE was in the two path through the turn when in close pursuit into
 the lane, bid while straightening into the lane, loomed a serious threat near the eighth pole then flattened out. SIDAVI was never a threat while near the
 inside through the turn. MYSTERY UNBRIDLED chased the pace from the three to the two path into mid-turn then faded. SO CAUGHT UP IN U was in the
 four path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

 BOOM FIVE THOUSAND tracked the winner from along the inside through the turn, could not gain on the top one but kept on well to save the place spot.
 ROUGHIN THE CITY raced in the two to the four path through late turn, came into the lane from the four path, could not gain on the top one then missed
 the place spot. ADMIRAL BROWN was in the two path through the turn, continued in the three path into the lane and moved up while never a threat. SLATE
 was in the three or four path through the turn and never was a factor. CELER hopped inwardly and hit the gate at the start thus spotting the field at least
 three lengths, raced through the turn from the two path, bumped rival entering the lane and was never a menace. U. S. WARRIOR chased the pace from the
 three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and was empty. SEA NOBLE show early speed into the turn then retreated from near the

 RIVER ECHO (GB) set the pace while under some pressure into the backstretch, shook clear near the five-eighths pole, remained clear while near the
 inside, was asked for more into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then held. BROKEN PROMISE was in the two path through the turns, remained in the
 two or three path through the lane, was no match for the winner but finished well clear for the place spot. POWERFUL ALLY was in the four path through
 the first turn, raced in the three path through the far turn, bid three wide into the lane, looked to have good momentum straightening in the lane, then
 flattened. IKE WALKER chased the pace from the three path through the turn then weakened after turning into the lane. HARD TO BE GOOD pressed the
 pace into the backstretch, continued to chase the pace into the far turn and was done nearing the five-sixteenths pole. FLAT LUCKY was done after going a
 half while in the two path and was galloped to the wire when hopelessly beaten.

 MISS ARTIE broke sharply, took back and settled three wide, angled six wide at the eighth pole, rallied and was up in time under steady urging. LET'S
 ROLL pressed the pace in the four path, bid at the eighth pole, was clear late and was caught. UNAPOLOGETIC ME stalked the pace between foes and
 improved late while no threat. SUPPORT was bumped at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, then failed to menace. ELLE'S CROWN dueled inside,
 then gave way late. BERNING REPENT pressed the early pace inside, settled, stalked and then gave way in the stretch. FRENCH LEGACY veered out at
 the start, dueled outside and gave way latte. LADY LEAH was squeezed back at the start. GREEDY AMERICAN was not a factor. AFRICA (FR) raced five
 wide before fading.
