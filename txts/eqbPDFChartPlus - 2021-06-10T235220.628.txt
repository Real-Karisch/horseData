 Footnotes
 EMPTY HOUSE controlled the pace inside, repulsed several challenges and lasted. VALIANT SPIRIT pursued the winner throughout and continued gamely
 to the finish. PRETTY VENEZUELA saved ground throughout, rallied mildly but was no match for the top pair. BLACKBIRDHASSPOKEN lacked speed,
 chased inside and passed rivals without menacing. GLAMOUR QUEEN chased wide all the way and flattened out through the stretch. LAYLA'S VOYAGE
 bobbled at the start, raced outside and was no factor. KELLY AND KILEY urged close up three wide, drifted wider on the final turn fading. FOREVER FAITH
 dropped back early and trailed throughout.

 WIND SPIRIT lodged his bid from the outside and ran down the leader in the final furlong then prevailed. TRAPPEZIO awaited room while boxed around the
 turn, came between rivals in close quarters into the stretch and finished well. DOWN MARKET disputed the pace then gave way grudgingly. NAUGHTY
 DELITE lacked the needed closing kick. SPIDER JOHN rallied mildly. TWO STEPPIN vied for the early lead and weakened. ARRIVANO stumbled at the
 start then was no factor. A claim of foul by the rider of TRAPPEZIO against the winner for interference in the stretch was not allowed by the stewards.

 INCLEVELAND vied outside early, moved inside leading before the half, repelled a challenge in mid-stretch and edged clear. GRAZEN HONOR dropped
 back early, advanced wide and closed well for the place. MRS. REMBRANDT prompted the pace outside, rallied to near even terms in mid-stretch then
 weakened. STELLA B. ducked out at the start, chased three wide and lacked a bid. OUR JULIET urged close up in the two path, faded on the final turn.
 STAR OF MIDNIGHT vied along the rail through the opening quarter and was finished after half a mile. DEREYA in tight early, lacked speed and stopped
 abruptly.

 THE POOCH was hustled up after a sluggish break to a clear lead to set the pace then held rival safe. PAHALL REVEAR raced in close pursuit, lacked the
 needed closing kick and was easily second. FACTOR THIS IN rallied mildly to gain the show late. WIZARD OF ODDS was fractious in the gate then lacked
 a solid rally. DARK MOON chased then weakened. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN showed little. ON THE WALL was no factor. I AIN'T KITTEN tired from his early

 Footnotes
 CLOWNEY pursued the loose pacesetter, took over near the quarter pole and quickly moved clear under moderate urging. UNDENIABLE TEMPER lagged
 far behind, advanced wide and closed well too late while no threat to the winner. YAKOV well placed three wide, was asked for run on the final turn then
 flattened out. ACT OF MADNESS saved ground throughout and continued well while no threat. WENDY WEND hustled to a clear advantage, was collared
 on the final turn then struck the rail near the eighth pole while faltering. GENERAL BELLAMY chased outside and was never in contention. LAWYER DAVE
 broke a step slowly and gave way after half a mile.

 Footnotes
 GHAREEB allowed to settle outside, bid on the final turn and held on gamely following a long drive. RECANTED saved ground off the pace, angled out in
 the stretch but could not get by the winner. URBAN BURN dueled outside, angled in leading on the final turn then weakened. CHASING TWILIGHT dropped
 back outside, moved very wide into the stretch and had a mild rally. CHIPPEWAWHITECHIEF chased inside and lacked a solid rally. FRANKLIN prompted
 the pace three wide for three quarters and faded. STAR OF SARAVA earned a narrow advantage inside then faded into the far turn. PICOZZA broke
 sluggishly and was always outrun. TITANIUM HEART chased very wide and was never in contention. DIAMOND PRINCE trailed throughout.
