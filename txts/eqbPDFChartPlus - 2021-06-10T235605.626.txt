 TONALIST'S SHAPE settled nicely in forward position while tracking the early leader, prompted and advanced two wide to briefly race on equal terms with
 FILLY JEAN KING then took command and held clear at the quarter pole, roused for more at head of the lane, stayed sharp and finished going away. CECI
 VALENTINA moved out wide after the start racing off the early speed, angled to the inside late backstretch, advanced near the inside then switched out at
 the quarter pole, came out wider for the drive, was no late match for the winner and settled for second best. FILLY JEAN KING was away in good order and
 took over the early lead, set the pace racing near the inside down the backstretch, briefly race on equal terms then failed to move on with eventual winner
 around the turn, kept on under steady pressure and raced along for share. ADDILYN raced off the speed in opening stages then prompted and advanced
 into a forward position, could not hold position around the turn then raced evenly through the lane. POWER MOVE raced in range down the backstretch,
 continued in contention around the turn then weakened in the lane. GREATER PLAN raced in the back and failed to make a bid. MISS CHEENY raced near

 BLAZING DESIRE raced three deep near the lead entering the first turn, continued in a forward position and applied pressure to the leader, raced on equal
 terms in the turn then edged away turning for home, drifted out wider entering top stretch, came under right handed pressure and kept clear. COSMIC
 TREASURE settled nicely while rated off the pace down the backstretch, began to show interest around the far turn, was set down driving two wide at head
 of the lane, gained position and stayed on with good response. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME secured inside position and tracked the top two leaders down the
 backstretch, angled off the inside and headed in pursuit around the turn, continued a steady bid under pressure and secured share. STORM RISK raced
 four deep entering the first turn, settled in range down the backstretch, given cue near the three eighths pole, kept on six wide with response in upper stretch
 then yielded. HE'S SUPER LUCKY was allowed to settle and raced in the back through early stages, picked up the pace around the far turn, kept on three
 to four wide in the lane and needed more for late impact. KING OF RANCH settled off the early pace and saved ground through the far turn, angled out a
 couple paths at head of the lane and lacked the needed response to threaten. BUSHIDO'S WAY held a slim lead around the first turn, set the pressured
 pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn then gave way in the lane. GARNETT raced off the early pace, hustled up around the far
 turn, kept under a ride along the outside in upper stretch and failed to move on. ELECTRIC HEAT was a bit keen and steadied slightly leaving the first turn,
 settled and raced in range down the backstretch, roused along the rail around the far turn then faded. GLOBAL CURRENCY raced off the pace then hustled
 along four wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. Run up distance unavailable

 around the turn, roused for more turning for home, challenged by WENT WEST in upper stretch, got headed for the lead then dug back in gamely from the
 inside, refused to be denied, took back a slight edge and held firm. WENT WEST gained a contending position out of the gate and tracked the top two
 leaders through early stages, hustled up three wide around the turn, advanced to duel for the lead with SHIVAREE in upper stretch, took a slight edge from
 the outside position then lost the lead, continued with a good effort but could not get back by the game winner. COMPLEXIFIER raced in contention off the
 top two leaders in early going, hustled along and raced two wide in close contention through the turn, could not kick on with the top pair in upper stretch but
 kept clear for share. AYCAPOTE raced off the early pace, came under a ride and raced three wide in upper stretch and failed to gain a threatening position.

 Footnotes
 CHEERMEISTER held a slim lead and secured inside position around the first turn, continued near the inside and set the pace down the backstretch,
 remained clear and comfortable around the far turn, was put to a drive along the inside in stretch run and held firm. SUNSET PROMISE settled nicely while
 rated down the backstretch, picked up the pace racing two wide around the far turn, shifted to the inside position at head of the lane, roused forward and
 lasted for place. LUCKY JINGLE raced off the early pace, launched a bid along the outside near the quarter pole then raced wide into stretch, kept on with
 response and got nipped for place. AMERICAN GIANT raced in range down the backstretch, came under a ride three wide near the quarter pole, continued
 a bid in upper stretch then evened out. DIAMONDS ARE A rated along the inside down the backstretch, moved through the far turn along the rail then
 stayed inside and had a mild improve. ENVIED stalked the leader through early stages, hustled up three wide around the far turn then gave way in the lane.
 FUJAIRAH stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, came under a ride racing two wide around the turn, stayed on in upper stretch then
 faded in final furlong. SPEIGHTSTOWN GAL settled two to three wide down the backstretch, roused for more around the far turn and lacked the needed
 response for impact. ALAFIA raced in the back then urged three wide into the lane and failed to move into contention.

 of the lane, continued to steadily gain on the late leader and just missed. MALIBU MUSIC was allowed to settle through early stages, hustled up four wide
 around the final turn, raced in striking distance in late stages and lacked the needed kick to move by. UNLIMITED DATA raced near midpack saving ground,
 picked up the pace and raced four wide entering top stretch, shifted to the rail and raced in close contention then lacked room and steadied nearing the
