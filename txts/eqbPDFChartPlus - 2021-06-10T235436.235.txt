 Footnotes
 LATE NIGHT POW WOW rushed up and angled in to rate the pace inside, increased her lead through the backstretch and around the turn on the rail, then
 was tapped twice down the lane and was much the best. LADY'S LADY, squeezed between Mistro Ali and Starboard after the break, saved ground in the
 first turn and settled well off the pace inside, made a bid leaving the seven-sixteenths pole and eased out from that point, steadily improved through the turn
 in the four path, then dug in under steady handling and finished well. STARBOARD broke in and bumped Lady's Lady at the start and settled well back,
 made a bid nearing the three-eighths pole, improved through the turn in the three path and moved to the outside leaving the turn, then raced down the lane
 and finished evenly. FLIRTIN HEART settled off the pace on the inside and made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole, eased out to take the turn in the
 three path, then leveled off in the lane. DECIDING FACTOR stalked the pace from the outside, began dropping back past the seven-sixteenths pole, made
 a bid a furlong later and went around the far turn on the rail, but was through after a half. MISTRO ALI broke out and bumped Lady's Lady at the start but
 was never a factor. WE DID IT was never a threat. BLOWN AWAY BABY was through after a half.

 Footnotes
 SET'EM UP JOE angled in through the front stretch to stalk the pace from the two and three paths the opening turn, challenged nearing the seven
 sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep rounding the far turn, was carried out leaving the turn, took the edge mid-stretch and dug in
 from there to earn the nod. EMBLEM'S ESTATE raced off the early pace inside then steadied into the first turn, eased out past the nine sixteenths pole,
 started a bid leaving the three eighths, improved four wide on the far turn, lugged inward to make contact with Cinderellas'spalace a sixteenth away,
 continued gamely from there but missed the nod under the wire. HE'S SPECIAL rated the pace from the inside, was pressured nearing the seven sixteenths
 pole, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the far turn, drifted into the lane, held the advantage to mid-stretch but dug in gamely to late yards before
 reluctantly yielding. CINDERELLA'SPALACE raced in the four path the first turn and settled just off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
 the far turn three wide, was bumped inward and into Cashton Peak mid-stretch, steadied briefly but recovered stride to finish evenly. CASHTON PEAK
 settled off the pace and off the rail the opening turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail but was bumped in
 and checked mid-stretch and lost all chance. THE SQUIRE, just off the pace and off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase from the half mile pole but
 started to fade past the three eighths. I NEED YOU, off the pace about the five path the first turn, settled outside into the backstretch but showed little
 response. NO HUNTING ducked in and checked at the start then trailed. The stewards reviewed an objection against the rider of Emblem's Estate, lodged
 by the rider of Cashton Peak, and disqualified the former for causing a chain reaction which ultimately affected the latter and Cinderella'spalace in
 mid-stretch.

 B'S WILD CORK was steadied on the rail shortly after the start and settled close off the pace inside, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths pole and took the
 lead near the five-sixteenths, dueled around the turn on the rail, then drove down the lane and drew clear near the sixteenth pole, and widened to the wire.
 IMAGOODCHATTERBUG settled off the pace on the outside and took the lead without encouragement near the three-eighths pole but was overtaken
 approaching the five-sixteenths, dueled through the turn in the three path, then dug in down the stretch, leveling off in the final sixteenth. DORIDORI settled
 well back on the outside and made a bid near the three-eighths pole, angled in toward the rail at the five-sixteenths to round the far turn in the three path,
 was steadied near the three-sixteenths pole while boxed in, then swung out to mid-track leaving the turn and lugged in down the lane. FALSE PROPHET
 settled well off the pace outside and made a late bid at the quarter pole in the four path, then angled in to the rail leaving the turn, but weakened in the
 stretch. PROCIDANA settled off the pace inside, made a bid near the three-eighths pole and moved to the outside at that point, went around the turn in the
 four path, but flattened in the lane. ALLEGHENY MACGRAW raced in the nine path throughout and came up empty in the lane. CHIPLEE saved ground in
 the first turn but showed little further. FRAGRENT CANDLE set the pace inside, was caught near the three-eighths pole and steadied from between horses
 just past that point, then faded from there. B F F ABBEY was through early.

 GREENWAY COURT settled off the pace and off the rail, started a bid nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail, eased out through the upper
 stretch and took over later yards in a well timed ride. CAT COME HOME broke out to make contact with Eutaw Street, picked up the chase toward the
 outside, raced in the six path of the turn, finished well to take place later yards and was gaining on the winner. NAY'S BACK pressured the pace two deep,
 moved alongside Chasin Rush midway through the turn, took the edge a sixteenth away but was caught in later yards and flattened stride approaching the
 wire. EUTAW STREET quickly recovered stride to pick up the chase after being jostled at the break, rounded the turn about the three path and finished well.
 CHASIN RUSH was hustled along inside to set a pressured pace, headed midway on the turn, yielded the advantage mid-stretch then flattened out later
 yards. LAST PLUNGE gave chase while racing off the rail and finished evenly. NEW WINDSOR stumbled inward and made contact with Eutaw Street
 leaving the gate, picked up the chase from the outside, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly. GEORGE TOWN CAT chased the pace
 from the inside, raced at the rail rounding the turn, steadied approaching the head of the lane but had little left through the lane.

 Footnotes
 SEVERN TIDE settled off the pace on the inside, eased out going into the backstretch and made a bid near the three-eighths pole, took the lead near the
 quarter pole and dueled through the turn in the five path and in the upper stretch, then pulled ahead past the sixteenth pole and widened to the wire. BOCA
 BIRDIE, saving ground in the first turn, stalked the pace from the inside, made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the three path,
 then eased out through the stretch and was gaining on the winner in the final sixteenth. LIME JUICE was bumped at the start by Fired Up Chic then was
 pinched back and settled well off the pace on the outside, made a bid near the three-eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the seven path, then drew to even
 terms at the head of the lane and dueled in the upper stretch but leveled off after the sixteenth pole. FOREST ACCORD was bumped at the start by Fired
 Up Chic then rated the pace on the outside, was caught near the quarter pole and dueled through the turn in the three path, then saved ground leaving the
 turn and leveled off in the stretch. GREAT ROCKET settled off the pace on the outside early then angled in entering the backstretch, made a bid leaving the
 three-eighths pole and went around the far turn in the five path, then gained down the lane and finished evenly. NIK NIK'S CASTLE settled off the pace on
 the outside and made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, then moved to the outside leaving the turn and finished
 evenly. DURING GRACIE settled well off the pace on the outside, made a bid at the three-eighths pole, took the turn in the six path, then drifted out down
 the lane. FIRED UP CHIC broke out and bounced between Lime Juice and Forest Accord then settled off the pace on the outside but showed little, and
 faded in the lane. SMARTY PLEASE broke awkwardly then settled outside and was never a threat. SOARING ELLA was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 ELLO GOVNA angled in to stalk the pace off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dug in at the head of the lane to take over inside the sixteenth pole
 and inched clear toward the wire. HELP A BROTHER rated the pace inside, was pressured leaving the five sixteenths pole, caught inside the sixteenth then
 weakened approaching the wire. BLAZIN LUCK saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved at the rail rounding the far turn
 and was along to take third mid-stretch but had little more. IN THE FAIRWAY saved ground off the pace, bid at the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
 turn four wide and was outfinished in the duel for third. ALLEN'S CASTLE, off the pace about the three path, bid mildly leaving the three eighths pole,
 continued in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly. LUCY'S BOB BOY stalked the pace two deep and took aim into the backstretch, engaged in
 close chase most of the backstretch but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then weakened through the
 lane. HEAR THE CHATTER came through the front stretch in the four path then settled off the pace two deep past the five eighths pole, started a bid
 leaving the three eighths, raced in range while five wide approaching the top of the stretch then flattened stride down the lane. RUN REAL QUIET raced well
 back. ROCKET ROAD rounded the first turn in the four and five paths and was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 NOBLAME set a pressured pace three wide on the outside and engaged in a three-way duel down the backstretch, drew clear past the quarter pole in the
 five path, angled in to the rail leaving the turn, then drove down the lane under moderate handling and was much the best. NELLYSFORD pressured the
 pace from the inside and engaged in a three-way duel through the backstretch, rounded the turn on the rail, then finished evenly. CORKY PUNCH gave
 chase from the outside and took the turn in the six path, then gained down the lane, passing rivals, and was quickly gaining on the runner up. I AM FURH
 REAL gave chase on the outside at a distant fourth and rounded the turn in the three path, then ducked in late in the lane and finished evenly. BOUND TO
 WINDSOR pressured the pace two wide between horses and engaged in a three-way duel through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path, then
 leveled off in the lane. WOLFBLADE hesitated at the gate then gave chase well back on the inside, eased out around the three-eighths pole and took the
 turn in the four path, then raced down the stretch and finished evenly. SILKEN BELLE raced on the rail but was never a factor. HIP HOP raced wide and
 was never a factor. GHOST FEVER hesitated in the gate then gave chase two wide between horses but was through early.

 Footnotes
 WILLIAM AND MARY rushed up for inside position to take over just inside the three eighths pole, was urged away at the rail through the turn and proved
 much the best with steady handling. After a brief lead, PUNCH YOUR BROTHER chased William And Mary through the backstretch, dropped back nearing
 the quarter pole, proved no match for that one and had to settle for second best. DIONYSUS' CHALICE chased the pace toward the outside through the
 backstretch, rounded the turn in the five path and finished evenly for third. OWEN'S WAY chased the pace toward the outside, saved some ground into the
 turn, left the turn five wide, eased out past the eighth pole and finished evenly. TRUE HEIR chased the pace from the outside, rounded the turn in the six
 path and raced evenly through the lane. BINN GOODE chased the pace from the inside, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened. OWEN'S MO broke out
 to exchange contact with Grand Fiber, picked up the chase in the four path, saved some ground on the turn then had little further through the stretch. MR.
 JACOBY chased the pace inside, raced off the rail rounding the turn and had little further down the lane. GRAND FIBER broke in to exchange contact with
 Owen's Mo, gave chase in the five path then weakened in the stretch. WONDER HOW steadied on the chute and was hard held while lacking room early,
 picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the seven path of the turn.

 Footnotes
 MOONLIT SONG rushed up and angled in to rate the pace inside, was met at near even terms at the three-eighths pole, drew clear through the turn on the
 rail, then drove down the lane, widening her lead, and was much the best. T REX EXPRESS settled off the pace on the outside and made a bid at the
 five-sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the five path, then dug in determinedly down the stretch and finished evenly. JACKY'S NOTION chased the pace
 from the outside and drew to near even terms at the three-eighths pole, dropped back a bit through the turn in the three path, then leveled off in the lane.
 TRICKY WINDSOR, saving ground in the first turn, settled off the pace inside at a distant fourth, eased out through the backstretch and made a bid leaving
 the three-eighths pole, went around the far turn in the six path, then finished evenly. CANDY MAN'S GIRL settled well back on the outside, made a bid near
 the three-eighths pole and angled in near the five-sixteenths to take the turn on the rail, then finished well. ROMANTIC CORK raced well back on the rail
 and weakened through the turn, then passed tired rivals down the lane while drifting out. SPA CREEK was bumped at the start by Lies and Scandals, then
 saved ground going into the first turn and settled well off the pace on the inside, moved to the outside leaving the turn, made a mild bid near the
 five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the seven path, then leveled in the stretch. LIES AND SCANDALS broke in and bumped Spa Creek at the start,
 then saved ground in the first turn and settled close off the pace on the inside, made a bid at the three-eighths pole and rounded the turn on the rail, but
 faded in the lane. BLISSTIKUS hit the gate at the break; was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 After being bumped in and into Follow The Notion, UNRIDEABULL accelerated to the front while angling in and rated the pace, was met at even terms
 leaving the first turn, moved away from that rival approaching the three eighths pole, widened the advantage through the far turn then dug in under steady
 encouragement to hold on. START LINE came away awkwardly to make contact with Follow The Notion and was squeezed shortly afterward, settled back
 in the three and four paths, eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved four wide on the far turn, dug in at the
 head of the lane to finish strong for second and was gaining on the winner. After being bumped at the break and forced into Start Line, FOLLOW THE
 NOTION settled off the pace in the four path the opening turn, raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in
 the four path then dueled through the stretch for second. PRINCE OF WINDSOR came away awkwardly and in to make contact with Unrideabull, angled in
 through the front stretch, roughed off the heels of Scythe in the vicinity of the five eighths pole, settled close into the backstretch, bid nearing the three
 eighths pole, raced two deep on the far turn then leveled off later yards. CHARITABLE ANNUITY settled back in the three and four paths, bid nearing the
 three eighths pole, improved off the rail rounding the far turn, eased out in the upper stretch and finished evenly. SCYTHE angled in to stalk the pace off the
 rail, moved to even terms into the backstretch, gave chase from that point, raced evenly at the rail rounding the far turn, showed no further response in the
 stretch, was unsaddled on the turn and vanned off sore. BIG BAD DUDE saved ground off the pace the first turn, eased out past the half mile pole, bid
 toward the three eighths then leveled out off the rail rounding the far turn. CASTLE BOUND bobbled inward and was forced outward and into Start Line
 soon after the start, settled off the pace in the four path the first turn, raced close into the backstretch then faded past the three eighths pole. GOLD
 SOVEREIGN, off the early pace, eased out into the backstretch and showed little response. CREATIVE MIST rated close toward the inside through the front
 stretch, steadied in the vicinity of the five eighths pole, gave chase from the half mile pole then faded through the backstretch. After posting the inquiry, the
 stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Unrideabull, lodged by the rider of Start Line, but found the rider of Unrideable faultless in the incident
 leaving the gate.

 LAKE PONCHATRAIN was slow into stride at the start then settled well off the pace on the outside, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths pole and
 improved on the outside through the backstretch, took the lead near the quarter pole in the four path and angled in to the rail leaving the turn, then drove
 down the lane and held on well. KATHBALLU settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid near the three-eighths pole and took the far turn in the three
 path, then ducked in toward the rail mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. SWEET ON SMOKEY was bumped at the start by It's the Truth then stalked
 the pace from the outside, took over near the three-eighths pole, was asked for more half a furlong later, then was caught near the quarter pole in the three
 path and leveled off in the lane. LINE OF BEST FIT settled off the pace inside, made a bid approaching the three-eighths pole and eased out to round the
 turn in the four path, then gained down the stretch and finished evenly. IT'S THE TRUTH broke in and bumped Sweet on Smokey at the start then saved
 ground in the first turn and settled off the pace inside, made a mild bid leaving the seven-sixteenths pole and moved to the outside after that point, took the
 turn in the five path, but leveled off in the lane. RIVETER GLORIA hustled up and angled in to rate the pace inside, was caught near the three-eighths pole
 and faded through the turn. SHE'S GOING STRONG was never a factor. ULTIMATE HOLIDAY was through after a half.

 Footnotes
 TEQUILITA broke out to make contact with Chanel's Legacy then settled off the pace toward the inside, eased out into the backstretch, started a bid
 approaching the three eighths pole, progressed steadily to take the lead three wide toward the head of the lane, raced clear at the eighth pole and held well
 under steady handling in spite of her saddle slipping back. YORKIEPOO PRINCESS angled toward the inside and settled close through the front stretch,
 raced four wide into the backstretch, pulled herself to the front approaching the three eighths pole, soon cleared Astrollinthepark, was pressured for run into
 the far turn, caught nearing the head of the lane, dropped back a furlong away and was outmatched in the drive for home while managing to hold on for
 second. OVERTURE raced well back toward the inside, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced in the three path rounding the far turn, angled five
 wide leaving the turn, lugged in through the stretch and finished evenly to maintain third. BERNED raced well back toward the inside, eased out entering the
 backstretch, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, improved her position six wide on the far turn and raced evenly down the lane.
 ASTROLLINTHEPARK rated a short lead inside leaving the five eighths pole, was headed by Yorkiepoo Princess at the three eighths, gave chase from that
 point, raced in range off the lead near the rail rounding the far turn but dropped back into the stretch and weakened in the drive. SHIMMERING ASPEN
 rated off the pace in the four and five paths the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and briefly improved her position, rounded the far turn in the
 five path then weakened from the top of the lane. MUNNY SPUNT drifted into the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch then showed little
 response from the three eighths pole. R ANGEL KATELYN broke in and made contact with Chanel's Legacy, was hustled along with a slim lead between
 horses through the front stretch, dropped back into the first turn, gave chase from that point then started to fade nearing the five sixteenths pole.
 DOWNTOWN MAMA rated close three wide through the front stretch, dropped back into the first turn, gave chase from the half mile pole then faded past
 the three eighths. CHANEL'S LEGACY, jostled soundly leaving the gate, eased shortly afterward and was vanned off in obvious distress.
