 Footnotes
 JOYCE'S REFLECTON was slow leaving the gate, advanced outside early, took over four wide entering the turn, angled in to be three wide before a half,
 ran clear in early stretch and was under mild urging through the lane. WORTH THE WAIT trailed early, raced two wide between rivals into the stretch, edged
 out in the lane and gained to the end. INHERENT VALUE made the early pace between rivals, angled to the rail on the turn and weakened. RUNTHISWAY
 was prominent early between rivals, raced three wide into the turn, swung wide into the stretch and lacked a strong closing. FINAL TALE pressed the early
 leader from along the rail then fell back entering the turn. TANGO WITH LOIS showed speed between rivals, raced inside the winner around the turn then
 weakened in the lane.

 Footnotes
 MISSED HIM sat well rated of the pace while saving ground around the first turn, had no where to run turning for home so was forced to enter the stretch in
 the five path, rallied well when asked, took control of the lead with seventy yards to go and won driving. BIG PLATINUM stalked the pace on the outside
 going three and four wide around the turns, edged clear at the quarter pole and dug in for the drive but did not have enough to hold off the winner. BLYDE
 RIVER stalked the pace between horses while going two wide around the turns, ran all out through the stretch but was no match. ANDY'S SPECIAL hit the
 gate at the start and the outside door appeared to come in again, was unfazed then was allowed to settle, saved ground around the first turn but had to
 swing very wide into the stretch, had a long outside rally while drifting out. MARCH TO MY TUNE sat well rated off the pace while going two wide around the
 turns then lacked the needed rally. STEAL THE BREW vied for the lead on the outside going two wide around the turn then grew tired with three sixteenths
 to go. ALL BLINGED OUT stalked the pace on the inside, had no response when asked for more and was eased with a furlong to go. PEARSONALITY
 TOO was quick to the lead then set a pressured pace, stayed on the rail the whole way but came up empty at the quarter pole. AL tracked the pace on the
 outside while going five wide around the first turn, swung for home going two wide but had no response. I LOVE MY BICYCLE was quick into stride while
 going three wide around the first turn, stalked the pace but got a spot on the rail on the backstretch but stopped at the three eighths pole. NICKY C was
 never asked for more.

 CORT'N ASONG wasn't never far back along the rail, waited for room approaching the stretch, got clear in early stretch, took over leaving the furlong
 grounds and widened under urging. SPIN MOVE opened a short lead soon after the break, stayed close to the rail while making the way into the final
 furlong then gave way. SPEIGHTSHILL lagged early then was going fastest through late stretch. JUDGE CARR had early position between rivals, raced
 three wide around the turn, was caught in tight and bumped with WILLIWAW entering the stretch then continued evenly. ULTRAFLAME began a run outside
 on the backstretch, gave his best four wide nearing the stretch, was bumped lightly entering the stretch and weakened. WILLIWAW pressed outside the
 early leader, was caught in tight and bumped with JUDGE CARR entering the stretch then tired. HIGHROLLER DAVE was slow from the gate, came out
 sharply entering the turn and failed to menace. RESURRECTION BAY briefly showed speed between horses.

 DOUBLE SKY bumped with WHY WEIGELIA at the start but shook it off, went up and dueled for the lead on the outside while going two wide around the
 turn, dug in when asked for more and held on. PAL CAL stalked the pace on the outside going four wide around the turn, was full of run at the three eighths
 pole and continued the momentum into the stretch, ran all out through the finish and almost got up in time. TREMBLANT lunged a bit at the break then sat
 well rated off the pace, saved ground around the turn and ran all out but was no match. ANY SUGAR HONEY chased the pace while going three wide
 around the turn, was full of run at the three eighths pole but flattened out at the three sixteenths pole. WHY WEIGELIA slid out of the gate and bumped into

 four wide around the turns, angled out at the three sixteenths pole and rallied well down the lane and almost got up in time. EVERY STEP lugged out at the

 gain when asked. PARADE OF FREEDOM got squeezed at the start then went up and chase the pace on the outside, went two and three wide around the

 Footnotes
 STORM APPROVAL RVF ran towards the rear while saving ground most of the way, was forced to swing four wide into the stretch, circled the field at the
 eighth pole and drew off from there. SOUTHERN TOUCH chased the pace while hugging the rail around the first turn, inched closer to the pace turning for
 home while going two wide, took control of the lead at the quarter pole and began to edged clear but was rundown by the winner. BUTTERFLY ROSE was
 allowed to settle off the pace, went three wide around the turns but lacked the needed rally. MULLIGAN'S SINGER trailed the field but saved ground, was
 forced to go five wide into the stretch, had a rally but it was not enough. FIELDS OF GOLD lugged out at the start then was allowed to settle off the pace,
 went two wide around the first turn but got a spot on the rail on the backstretch, vied for the life briefly at the eighth pole but flattened out. RHYTHM AND
 MOVES dueled for the lead on the outside going two wide around the turn then came up empty at the quarter pole. SMARTY MADDY tracked the pace
 while going two wide around the turns but had no response when asked for more. LA SALAZAR hit the gate at the start then dueled for the lead on the
 inside, stopped at the five sixteenths pole suddenly and was eased from there, finished, then was vanned off the track.
