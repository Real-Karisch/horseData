 Footnotes
 BOLD WOLF patiently handled saving ground around the turn, angled three wide upper stretch, split rivals with a furlong to go and surged strongly going
 clear at the finish. MINI COSMO well placed tracking to top of the lane, took aim coming three to four wide in upper stretch, loomed in deep stretch but was
 out finished by the winner to settle for second place in a good effort. GONE WILD broke alertly and angled inside, held a clear lead in mid stretch but would
 tire nearing the wire being overtaken to hold the show position. URDUWAAZ settled in mid pack saving ground, swung out five wide receiving strong
 encouragement, mildly gained late but needed more. FLYING AROUND lacked early foot traveling towards the rear, came out six wide in upper stretch,
 rallied belatedly. RICHARD'S TUNE well placed stalking along the rail, put to a drive turning for home but failed to respond and weakened in the lane. SPIN
 WILD rushed hard into the far turn, loomed off the leader at the quarter pole, began to flatten out mid stretch, no late factor. HOUSE OF PRAYER varied
 little traveling off the rail in the second flight, roused to no avail showing little. FOURTH TOP lacked speed racing mid track throughout. AMBER DUBAI
 dipped at the start losing the rider, horse completed the course and was vanned off.

 TRANSFIGURED broke alertly taking a short lead, headed by MY BROTHER STEVE entering the stretch, turned that rival and drove clear in deep stretch.
 MY BROTHER STEVE settled early in mid pack, made a bold bid to draw even with TRANSFIGURED in kid stretchy, was turned away to settle for second
 best in a hard effort. GEE PEA ESS settled in the second flight, came out six wide under a drive upper stretch, rallied willingly taking the show position. THE
 GREEK BOP raced up close from the start, gave chase entering the stretch, lacked rally and was out finished for a minor award. TEQUILA'S CHANCE
 raced in the second flight, roused running along the rail top of the stretch, lacked needed kick. DR DYNAMITE raced at mid track throughout, roused into the
 lane, failed to respond. FOUNTAIN RUN trailed soon after the start, swung out seven wide mid stretch, failed to menace. SAN NICOLO rushed hard
 pressing the winner briefly, faded in mid stretch and was vanned off after the race.

 Footnotes
 GREAT WAY LADY tracked around the bend, gained along the inside entering the stretch, dueled at the eighth pole the slowly edged away under strong left
 handed stick. D'FOREST DIVA hustled to the lead, set the pace racing three to four wide, headed into the lane, battled to deep stretch, weakened late and
 was fully extended saving second place. FLASHY WON was in close shortly after the start, settled in the second flight, roused splitting foes inside the eighth
 pole, surged willingly just missing second place. SINGSUMTHINFORME rushed hard into the far turn, stalked to the quarter pole, came five wide giving
 chase entering the stretch, loomed from mid stretch but leveled off to miss a minor award. KODIAK CUTIE tracked around the turn, came under a drive at
 the quarter pole, failed to threaten. CUTE DEPUTY raced along the inside turning for home, failed to menace despite being hard ridden. MY LANI ROSE
 trailed soon after the start, did improve position but was no factor. LADY SOYADORA tracked to the quarter pole, roused into the lane, failed to threaten.
 RIDE THE SHARK lacked speed offering little. HEAVENLY ENCORE hustled early racing up close to the quarter pole, began to drop off in upper stretch,
 used up.

 RISE TO THE TOP well rated to mid turn, rallied four wide drawing even entering the stretch, dueled abreast a trio of rivals briefly then drive clear and
 widened under steady urging. EILDON HALL set the pace for six furlongs racing in the three path, headed from both sides turning for home, was no match
 for the winner but gamely dug in to save second place. WILL'S MONEY stalked along the inside, set down at the quarter pole, vied along the rail top of the
 lane, leveled off and was out gamed late losing second place. OAKLEY WAY moved to mid track entering the backside, stalked to mid turn, rallied to vie for
 the lead running between foes in upper stretch, failed to sustain move and tired in mid stretch. LEAVE IT IN VEGAS settled towards the rear, roused to no
 avail and failed to threaten. DYNAMONDS FOREVER raced wide while trailing down the backstretch, failed to factor. HELLCAT chased the pace to the half,
