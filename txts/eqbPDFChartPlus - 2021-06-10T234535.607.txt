 Footnotes
 RAPO had a three wide trip, bid on the far turn, rallied between horses and prevailed in a driving finish. LAST CLASS TO GO raced off the pace between
 rivals, came three wide into the lane, rallied between foes and was just up for second. PERFECT EXECUTION raced three wide early, stalked, steadied
 entering the far turn, moved up inside on the turn and rallied on the rail. HIGH SIDE raced three wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and was
 outkicked. STEP TWO set the pace, dueled on the turn and weakened. CRIMSON HAYES raced off the pace inside, came five wide into the lane and rallied
 mildly outside. MIDNIGHT TRACE pressed the pace, bid on the turn and tired. BO'S BULLET raced inside and did not factor. SABBATARIAN was outrun.
