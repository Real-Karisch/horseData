 Footnotes
 MAST COVE broke readily to prompt the pace between foes in the opening stages, edged forward in the second furlong to dictate the pace on a narrow
 margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, maintained a narrow advantage to upper stretch and widened late under firm right handed pressure. J P'S GIA,
 forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside the pacesetter prompting that foe racing into the turn but proved no match in late
 stages. SISTER DRAMA, in touch between rivals in the first flight in the opening sixteenth, was eased off the leaders nearing the five furlong marker,
 tracked the first flight three wide into the turn, then upper stretch but weakened in the drive. MADISON BLUES tracked off the first flight along the inside and
 faded into upper stretch. MILBRA switched outside foes early, raced five wide into upper stretch and had no rally. NERVE LINE broke awkwardly, angled to
 the inside racing through the backstretch but failed to menace. TWOFOUR SIX OH ONE flashed brief pace four wide in the opening quarter but gave way
 abruptly nearing the turn. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

 MAMBO DANCER was urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the opening stages, continued to press the issue into the turn, shifted off the inside racing
 into upper stretch and edged forward between foes to prevail in the closing stages under right handed encouragement. ENDUROS TIGRESS broke readily,
 was eased off the first flight while angling to the inside early, tracked just off the first flight into the turn, bid for command inside the pacesetter racing into
 upper stretch but was outkicked. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA joined the pace outside rivals from the outset, pressed the pace three deep racing into the turn
 to upper stretch and weakened in late stages. ARTS AND CRAFTS, forwardly placed between foes just off the first flight in the opening stages, tracked the
 leaders between foes into the bend, was urged to advance inside the pacesetter between foes nearing upper stretch, then shifted out four wide in the
 closing stages while continuing with interest. DO WHAT IT TAKES, raced three wide between foes in second flight in the opening stages, was eased back
 from that position racing into the turn, was fanned five wide racing into the stretch while being prompted to advance but finished evenly. MANCORA settled
 off the second flight while angling inside early and never mounted a serious challenge. MORNING PRINCESS tracked just off the first flight racing four wide
 into the turn, was prompted to lodge a brief bid in that path nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out.

 Footnotes
 MALIO'S angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking just off the second flight racing into the first turn, advanced to challenge the pacesetter along
 the rail midway through the backstretch, shifted out racing into the far turn once gaining the advantage, turned back a challenge from CREDIT CYCLE
 nearing upper stretch and edged clear under firm right handed encouragement. DIG IN angled to the inside in the opening stages gaining a position just
 inside the eventual winner, tracked just off that foe along the inside racing into the far turn, gained position along the rail racing into upper stretch, then
 shifted out in late stages but couldn't gain terms with that foe. CREDIT CYCLE tracked the pacesetter four wide between foes racing to the backstretch,
 advanced in that path racing into the far turn to briefly gain terms with the eventual winner nearing upper stretch but flattened out in late stages.
 GUERRERON settled off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, angled outside foes on the far turn while being prompted to advance and
 gained some position in an even effort. UPPER CROWN tracked the pace three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, angled in on the far turn and
 steadily faded. MYSUREWINWILLIAMS settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. PREQUALIFIED was urged inside foes
 prompting the pace into the first turn, switched outside the pacesetter racing into the backstretch and emptied out after a half. YOU'LL LIKE IT, caught five

 Footnotes
 BETTER YET, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, conceded some position to track just off the leaders along the inside into the
 backstretch, shifted out on the far turn to advance in close quarters three deep between foes challenging for command nearing upper stretch, then wrested
 the advantage and edged forward late under firm right handed encouragement. SPEEDING STARLET tracked just off the first flight under light rating while
 switching outside those foes racing into the backstretch, advanced three deep after a half to challenge racing into the far turn, dueled for command between
 rivals through the second bend, then inside the winner to late stages but came up second best. ASHLEY'S ROSE, reserved outside foes racing to the
 backstretch, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner racing four wide through the far turn to briefly loom outside the top pair but lacked the needed
 final kick. SECRET TEMPLE, urged to dispute the pace while angling to the inside nearing the backstretch, dueled inside foes racing into the far turn and
 gave way entering upper stretch. A ROSE FOR LIZZY joined the pace outside foes in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival, then between
 foes for five furlongs but emptied out early.

 Footnotes
 SINGANOTHERSONG tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out three deep leaving the midway point of the
 turn readily advancing on the leaders, took over entering upper stretch and kicked clear under firm left handed encouragement. ROCKYSBUCKAROO,
 forwardly placed three wide attending the pace in the opening stages, eased off the leaders to track those foes outside a rival racing to the bend, was
 fanned four wide nearing upper stretch while advancing in tandem with the eventual winner, couldn't match terms with that foe in late stages but prevailed
 for the place honors. FORWARD MOTION, urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the outset into the turn, weakened in the drive. KEEP THE
 COMMISH tracked off the second flight between foes in early stages, angled to the rail nearing the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and made an effort
 to improve position. DEFICIT HAWK tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. I'M IN A HURRY, urged between
 foes pressing the pace from the outset, dueled for command into the turn and gave way in upper stretch. SEVENTYSEVENWILOW settled near the inside
 early, was steadied off a rival along the rail racing into the turn and never menaced thereafter. CHESTER MON tracked off the second flight three wide
 between foes and retreated early. AMERICAN LUXURY dropped out early.

 Footnotes
 NO CENTS LEFT tracked the leaders from just out of striking position along the inside racing into the first turn, continued under light rating while shifting out
 to race between foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance in tandem with a rival three deep on the far turn, shifted outside the pacesetter to race
 four wide in upper stretch and wore down that rival to prevail in time under firm right handed encouragement. PERP tracked just off the pacesetter three
 deep racing to the backstretch, shifted four wide after a half while being urged to advance in tandem with several rivals racing into the far turn, pressed the
 issue outside a rival through the turn, drifted out racing into upper stretch while gaining the advantage and held sway to late stages while just failing to
 contain the winner. K D'S CAT BIRD, caught four wide racing through the first turn tracking the leaders in second flight, advanced in that path in tandem with
 the eventual winner racing into the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but had no final kick. HEY BIG GUY, off a step slowly, angled to the rail
 in the opening stages, steadily regained contention inside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to challenge with an early move inside foes racing into the
 far turn to strike the front but came up empty in the drive. NAUTI BUOY was settled between foes off the second flight early and never gained contention.
 BLUE PIGEON, forwardly placed along the inside, switched outside the pacesetter racing into the backstretch while being prompted to challenge that foe on
 the backstretch but was through after five furlongs. SYNCLINES TRIP, urged to the lead racing into the first turn, emptied out after a half. RED CAT (CHI)
 ducked out at the start, was righted to track three deep between foes to the backstretch but dropped out early.

 Footnotes
 DON'T SPIN ME was urged clear in the opening stages while angling to the inside, held sway past midstretch and held the late challenge of MY COTTON
 CANDY under firm left handed pressure. The latter was settled near the inside, shifted out on the turn splitting foes three wide advancing to contention,
 shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner at the wire. MISS LOTUS FLOWER settled last, saved ground
 racing into the turn, swung out six wide in upper stretch and continued to improve position. AUNT BETTY was rated off the second flight between foes,
 came around a tiring foe to advance along the rail in upper stretch and continued with a mild bid. MIA'S BOBTAIL tracked off the second flight in early
 stages, raced four wide through the turn, was fanned five wide into the lane and had no closing bid. THEY CALL ME LUCKY broke awkwardly, angled inside
 to make some brief progress racing into the turn but proved empty in the drive. WINTER'S GRACE tracked the leaders between foes just off the second
 flight and faded early. MARDI GRAS GIRL switched off the inside early tracking the leaders in second flight, made brief pursuit of the pacesetter three deep
 on the turn but soon emptied out. TRACK MAGIC settled outside foes in early stages and never mounted a serious challenge. PLEASANT BUFFY, urged
 along pursuing the pacesetter outside a rival racing into the turn, gave way after a half. RETURN THE FAVOR flashed brief pace while angling to the inside
 but was spent early. MISS TEA BLONDE proved no factor.

 Footnotes
 EXCHEQUER, brushed at the start, angled to the inside racing to the first turn, steadily gained terms with the pacesetter between foes just off the inside
 racing into the backstretch, took over to dictate the pace into the far turn, dispatched a rival on the far turn, then held the challenge of RELISHMENT to the
 end under firm left handed encouragement. The latter racing three deep into the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter, was eased back from that position
 to race between foes on the backstretch, steadily advanced while angling inside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch to challenge for command and
 continued willingly to the end while proving only second best. CENTERFOLDPROSPECT tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening half,
 was prompted to challenge three deep racing into the far turn and faded entering the lane. SLEEPLESSDREAMMORE settled last along the inside, angled
 out four wide racing into the stretch but made no impact. LITIGANT, urged to the lead along the inside, gave way after a half.
