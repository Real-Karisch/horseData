 Footnotes
 ALL TRUMPED UP prompted the early issue, chased through the lane and finished gamely to prevail. HARNERSBACH set the early pace and edged clear
 on the turn, continued with a clear advantage into upper stretch then yielded grudgingly. NORM'S PLACE raced three deep on the turn and finished willingly
 while needing more. PULPITS POWER a bit fractious briefly in the gate, trailed while not far back then was gaining late while finishing between rivals.
 GRAND PALAIS raced between foes on the turn and needed more in the drive. PLASKA saved ground and lacked the needed response.

 Footnotes
 DREAMY GAL vied to the turn, drew off and extended her lead while ridden out. STURDY ONE saved ground, angled out on the turn, bid six wide and
 earned place while no match for the winner. RISQUE'S LEGACY led early, was taken back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, closed under strong
 urging and got up for show while no threat to the top two. I'M THE QUEEN was never far back, bid four wide to get within range and came up empty.
 KALLISTE ROSE raced outside, went five wide at the top of the stretch, bid and came up empty. KAST INTENTION contended inside, was steadied on the
 turn, dropped back and gave way.

 Footnotes
 MONUMENTAL SEVEN showed the way through the opening stages then tracked, took over from JUNE AND JOHNNY heading into the far turn, showed
 the way to the lane and edged away under urging. REAL LUTE bumped a rival early, trailed and raced five wide into the stretch then finished steadily and
 was clear for the place. SENJA bid along the inside on the far turn, moved out then drifted out entering the lane passing directly in front of a rival then
 needed more in the drive. BLANK IT saved ground early, moved out on the far turn, was bothered some entering the lane and lacked the needed response.
 JUNE AND JOHNNY bumped early, drew clear on the clubhouse turn, set the early pace then tired through the lane. NUMAANY'S REWARD a bit unsettled
 in the gate briefly, raced well placed outside and weakened through the stretch. The Quarter-mile fractional split was hand timed.

 Footnotes
 PAPPOU prompted the early issue, moved to the front on the far turn, drifted some to be in the five path entering the stretch then held gamely to the wire.
 SO LONG SAILOR between rivals on the backstretch, raced between foes again passing the quarter pole and loomed boldly inside PAPPOU to be on even
 terms a sixteenth out then needed just a bit more. HOT BOBBY lodged a bid from the outside on the far turn, raced in the six path entering the lane and
 finished willingly. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD lacked the needed rally. CELTURIAN angled inward on the clubhouse turn, raced up close and inside then tired in the
 drive. TON EIGHTY set the early pace near the rail and weakened in the drive. DR. WATSON saved ground and had no bid then tired through the stretch.

 MADDYMAX raced close to the pace, shifted out for the drive, closed under steady urging, got up near the sixteenth pole and was all out at the wire. NOT
 THAT I RECALL was unhurried early, trailed while never far back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, found her best stride late and was gaining
 ground. THE GREY ONE stalked the pace while racing outside, challenged five wide on the turn to duel, had the rider lose his whip near the eighth pole,
 continued gamely, faltered near the sixteenth pole and held for show. BULLICIOUS was hustled along to vie between horses, faltered near the sixteenth
 pole and lost position. TRINNI was checked after the start, awaited room on the turn, bid off the rail between horses to loom a threat, hung late and lost
 position. CHAMPION RISK vied three across to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. ONE AFLEET STAR was hustled along to vie inside to
 the turn and gave way.
