 Footnotes
 GREAT POWER stalked off the rail then outside a rival, bid three deep then alongside a foe leaving the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, lugged in a bit in
 the drive and inched clear in the final sixteenth under a couple left handed cracks of the whip and steady handling then a long hold in the final strides.
 THUNDER CODE broke in a bit, dueled outside a rival then between foes midway on the turn, angled in and regained the advantage leaving the turn, fought
 back along the rail in the stretch, could not match the winner in the final sixteenth but clearly bested the others. THREE FOOTER chased outside then
 alongside a rival leaving the backstretch and on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and just held third. EEL POINT dropped back off the rail then
 angled in and saved ground off the pace, came out leaving the turn and around a rival into the stretch and finished with some interest to be edged for the
 show. ROYAL THUNDER had good early speed and dueled inside, took a short lead into the turn, dropped back nearing the stretch, came a bit off the rail in
 the drive and weakened. HEROS REWARD stalked a bit off the rail to the stretch, continued just off the fence in the drive and also weakened. STACKIN
 SILVER broke a bit slowly and was slightly crowded, saved ground chasing the pace, dropped back in the stretch and gave way.
