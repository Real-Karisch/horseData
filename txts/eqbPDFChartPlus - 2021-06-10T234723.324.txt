 the lead, set the pace near the inside, was put to a drive nearing the quarter-pole, lost the lead at the top of the stretch, battled with the winner in the drive
 and missed while clear for the place. SERIOUS STEAM dropped back while urged along, went three then four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the

 then steadied, came under a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly to just miss the show. SWEETEST APPEAL broke in and a step slow, settled on the
 outside, was asked while three to four wide on the turn, jostled with a foe at the five-sixteenths, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed
 kick then just missed the superfecta. ANALYZE THIS CAT was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while inside on the turn, jostled with a foe
 near the five-sixteenths then checked repeatedly along the rail, dropped back into the stretch then moved out under a drive and gained late but failed to
 threaten. DIVA BANKER broke a bit slow and spotted the front a few lengths, angled in sharply at the rear, rounded the turn in the two then three path,
 drifted out outside the furlong marker and failed to respond. Following a stewards' inquiry into the run around the turn, no change was made to the order of
 finish.

 improved position to just miss the show. SINGINGINTHEWIND broke a step slow, raced at the rear, steadied to avoid the injured horse outside the half-mile

 and weakened then lost the show. ONEHOLYLION bumped soundly with a rival at the start, chased the early pace, made a bid midway down the
