 Footnotes
 EXPLOSIVE RUN stalked from the inside, loomed dangerously on the turn, angled outside the leader and challenged at the top of the stretch, kicked clear
 of that rival and outfinished CALLIE MESA in the lane. CALLIE MESA tracked the pace early from off the rail, swung out around the turn, rallied but was
 outkicked by the winner. SHE'S GONE WESTERN sped to the front, set the pace from the two path, held an narrow lead into the stretch and weakened late.
 ACCLAIMED CAT traveled along the inside into and around the turn and failed to rally. SHE'S MOVIN ON saved ground to the stretch and improved
 position. SHAREMYWAY raced off the rail, three wide into the lane and was never a factor. RED WHITE N FAST stumbled leaving, settled off the pace, two
 wide around the turn and weakened.

 GRACIAS TOM stalked the pace early, raced two wide around the turn, rallied through the stretch and reeled in FANCY TERRACE to win under a drive.
 FANCY TERRACE bumped nearing the three-eighths pole, dueled from the inside, gained a clear lead around the bend, held command through the drive
 but could not contain the winner late. WHERE'S BUBBA showed no early speed, raced along the inside, angled out in the upper-stretch and gained the
 show. GAMBLER'S WISH stalked from the inside, was in tight and checked entering the turn, continued to chase to the lane and never rallied. FAST LANE
 LARRY showed early speed three deep, altered out when rider fell off CORN ON THE CODE on the turn, continued off the rail to the lane and weakened.
 CORN ON THE CODE lugged in and bumped rival near the three-eighths pole, dueled for the lead outside of FANCY TERRACE, clipped heels with outside
 rival and lost the rider on the turn and was vanned off following the race.
