 Footnotes
 LEGENDARY VISION broke sharply, sprinted clear while angling to the inside, widened his advantage racing into upper stretch and just maintained the lead
 to the end under some left handed pressure. MIAS MOONBEAM, shifted out avoiding close quarters along the inside in the opening stages, gathered
 momentum on the turn shifting outside foes, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner to the end.
 ANOTHER RICHIE, slow into stride, settled last racing to the turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and improved his position. SPIN HARD worked his
 way to the inside tracking off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. GUARD YOUR GRILL, urged to contend four,
 then three wide as part of the second flight racing into the turn, faded into upper stretch. ST. PEREGRINE angled inside early but offered no rally.
 SOLANAIR urged between foes tracking the pacesetter in second flight, gave way into upper stretch. SAVEMETHELASTDANCE angled inside early
 tracking the pacesetter in second flight, came up empty racing into upper stretch.

 honors. HEY HEY, forwardly placed along the inside, shifted out to bid three deep racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the to pair. LOCK N LOLA,
 urged to the lead along the inside, dueled for command into the turn, went clear nearing midstretch but faltered late. SHORT AND SASSY, bumped at the
 start. tracked off the second flight between foes and continued evenly four deep in late stages. SHE KANT MISS angled to the rail tracking off the second
 flight racing into the turn, shifted out three deep between foes entering the lane but had no late bid. MISS CLASSY GIRL settled between rivals in early

 Footnotes
 DURANGO KID, brushed at the start, was righted to make a steady advance on the pacesetter racing into the turn, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch,
 continued in a protracted skirmish to late stages while being brushed but narrowly prevailed on the wire under firm right handed encouragement. CALEB'S
 HEIR broke sharply, dictated the pace along the rail into the turn, drifted out midstretch brushing the eventual winner while grudgingly resisting that rival to
 the end but was just outfinished. COLONEL FRED tracked the leaders four wide, then three wide between foes racing into the turn and continued well
 enough to edge a rival for a share late. GHOST POSITION, urged to gain a forward placing between foes racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.
 MAGIC DRAGON broke outwards brushing the eventual winner at the start, settled while angling inside racing into the turn but offered no rally.
 RAISEDONROCKNROLL, caught five wide racing to the turn tracking the leaders, soon dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF CALEB'S
 HEIR LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

 WAY broke sharply, moved clear dictating the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn and held sway to the end under pressure. CARTIAC ROAD
 angled inside tracking the pacesetter in second flight, continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. RIPPIN RANGER, urged to lead the second
 flight between foes racing to the backstretch, couldn't gain terms with the leader and weakened in late stages. READY RIGHT NOW tracked off the second
 flight early and improved position three deep between foes into the stretch. TAMBOV settled along the inside early and passed only tiring rivals. STEALTHY
 TRAVELER tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn and lacked a rally. WALK TIZ WAY settled outside a rival in the last flight early and
 proved no threat. EBEN ZABEEL, outpaced early, proved no factor. RODS RUN AWAY was urged to contend three wide between foes in second flight
 racing to the backstretch, gave way early. BROADWAY BRETT, caught four wide racing into the first turn, soon dropped out.

 REMINISCE was prompted to gain a forward placing attending a rival's pace under light reserve racing into the backstretch, took over from that foe on the
 far turn to set the pace on a narrow margin into upper stretch, shifted out through the final furlong while being roused to fend off several challengers and just
 prevailed under pressure. DESCARADO, pulling against restraint tracking just off the leaders along the rail racing into the backstretch, continued in that path
 into the far turn, shifted out sharply nearing midstretch bumping a rival while being roused to challenge between foes and continued willingly in close
 quarters to the end while just failing to edge the winner. R U FORREAL tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced
 on the leader three wide on the far turn to upper stretch, was bumped by DESCARADO nearing midstretch but continued willingly to challenge the top pair
 to the end while just outfinished. CLASSY STUDENT was settled between foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail racing into
 the far turn and improved position inside foes to late stages. COMMERCIAL APPEAL, caught four wide racing into the first turn to track off the second flight,
 continued in that path through the far turn to upper stretch but had no final kick. SARK LADY ducked out at the start, then was reserved in early stages,
 shifted outside foes racing into the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and gained some position while making no impact. BETTY GRABLES LEGS
 switched off the inside early to track between foes off the second flight but proved no threat. WAKE UP AND RUN tracked the leaders between foes in
 second flight in the opening half and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. TERRACE settled between foes in early stages, was caught wide racing into the
 far turn and soon faded. ENSONADOR settled along the inside early and proved no threat. DODA DOODLEALLDAY, urged to the lead along the inside, set
 the pace to the far turn and abruptly gave way after five furlongs. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
 STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED DESCARADO FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER THIRD.

 Footnotes
 PASS THE GRAVY was rated just out of striking distance tracking the first flight while shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on
 those foes three deep between foes racing into the far turn to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, then continued with a game effort to fend
 off a rival's challenge under brisk handling. SIR ANTHONY, caught wide into the first turn tracking the leaders outside rivals in the second flight, advanced
 on the leaders in tandem with the eventual winner four wide racing into the far turn, lost some ground to the leader racing into upper stretch but produced a
 solid second effort to challenge that rival again nearing the wire. GHAALEB'S WINNER, restless in the gate before the start, tracked off the second flight
 early, angled to the inside entering the backstretch, steadily gained position inside foes on the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch but had no final
 kick. MR. LUV MAKER settled between foes early, angled four wide into the stretch and improved position. BE AN INSPIRATION broke awkwardly, was
 settled last, then was fanned five wide into the stretch to pass some tiring rivals. RUN FOR CHARLIE, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival for the
 opening half mile, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way. IM THE BEST I KNOW switched off the inside early to the track the leaders between
 foes in second flight but faded entering the second bend. DEMAND RANSOM angled inwards while being urged to terms prompting a rival's pace, dueled
 for command to the far turn and gave way. SPANISH COYOTE proved no factor.

 Footnotes
 PERFECT PLUS, urged to terms with the first flight prompting the pace along the rail racing into the turn, edged forward into upper stretch and just held
 under firm encouragement. JOLEE tracked just off the first flight four wide in the opening stages, continued with a steady advance in that path on the turn to
 challenge for command into upper stretch and just missed. PARTAY joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue in that path
 between foes to upper stretch and was just outfinished by the top pair. VELVET SAMI switched out early tracking off the first flight racing into the bend,
 shifted five wide in upper stretch and finished evenly in late stages. REVIVE settled outside foes in the last flight dropping well off the leaders early, angled
 six wide racing into upper stretch and made some mild progress. KIM DANDY swerved out at the break bumping ARTIC VORTEX, was righted while
 angling to the inside to track just off the first flight racing into the turn, continued along the inside to upper stretch but had no final kick. ARTIC VORTEX,
 bumped soundly while being squeezed, then knocked back at the start, settled along the inside early and proved no threat. SILVER KITTY broke inwards
 bumping ARTIC VORTEX at the start, soon dropped out. SHE'S VENTASTIC was urged to prompt the pace between foes from the outset into the turn and
 gave way after a half.

 Footnotes
 WAKE UP JOE broke sharply, was urged to dispute the pace inside a rival racing into the turn, shook clear nearing midstretch and widened under pressure.
 GORGEOUS GEORGE tracked the pace between foes in second flight, shifted four wide on the turn while advancing on the leader and continued willingly
 to prevail for second. DR. CLARK, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the leaders, steadied racing into the bend, saved ground to upper
 stretch, then altered course out of tight quarters to race three deep in late stages while prevailing for a share. TYOGA SIX joined the pace outside a rival in
 the opening stages, pressed the issue to upper stretch, then weakened late. HAWK'S IMAGE tracked off the second flight between foes early, angled out
 entering the lane and continued evenly. LOOKTHEOTHERWAY tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned five wide into upper
 stretch but had no rally. SON OF PEARL, off slowly, proved no threat. STRICT OBSERVANCE proved no factor. KYZAN broke awkwardly, then was held
 up in early stages and trailed the field to the stretch. CAITLINS ROAD, urged to brief contention three deep racing into the turn, soon faded between foes,
 then was pulled up in late stretch but walked off under his own power.

 stretch but had no final bid. ALPHA BOY settled outside foes early and proved no factor. LOGI angled inwards a bit to track the leaders wide between foes
 in second flight, shifted five wide into the lane and faded. DEVIL HUNT, urged to gain a forward placing four wide, then three wide in second flight racing to
