 Footnotes
 PEBBLE SLINGER rated just off pace to the half, took over and cleared off through the stretch. PEPPER THEM GIRL chased the pace throughout, inherited
 the place spot late. SAFARI HEART raced along in good position, swerved inside late to avoid stricken foe in the late going for the show spot. TRUE
 SIMPLICITY raced rank, steadied along first turn, improved position inside after an eventful trip throughout. QUEEN JEANNE good position throughout,
 rallied in the stretch with a bid but went wrong just before the finish and pulled up quickly in distress while vanned off. OUR MARIKKA raced a wide trip while
 never a real factor. FOREVER THANKFUL set pace to the half but gave way readily thereafter. SENORITA JOSEFINA dropped hopelessly far back and
 eased across the wire and subsequently walked off.

 SUNNY'S RAINBOW speed to the front, well handled to stay clear to the wire. COURT'S RULING well placed, much the best, three path into stretch for
 place. DOUBLE DERINGER just off rail, in tight to the turn and shuffled back a bit but came back running for for show. RUN RUN dueled on the lead to
 quarter pole but weakened through the drive. NORTHERN EMPIRE no speed to the turn and only moved up wide into the stretch run while no real threat.
 TATTAGLIA rank after the start with not much after that, no gain. FEET'S AFIRE never a factor. MAGICAL CONNECTION saved ground to no avail. THE
 LAST DISCIPLE failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 OLD CENTRE no speed to turn, split horses into the stretch and, rallied outside to go clear late. DEAR BENNY chased pace to the turn, dug in gamely
 through the final furlong to earn the place spot. MISS DISCREET good speed to the front, stayed to deep stretch but lost place spot on the wire. SPOT A
 KISS just off pace, came three wide into stretch while grudgingly in the late stages. QUEEN OF CORONA raced a five path trip throughout while mildly in
 the late going. ADORABLE EYES never a serious factor. DON'T TELL MOM up close to the turn but faded back from that point. CANARYINACOALMINE
 never a menace.

 SHARM good position to turn with a three wide run to lead and held sway to the wire. BUD'S BAYONET close early on, displaced into the turn, went inside
 with a mild run through the final stages. COMPULSIVE speed to lead from the rail to stretch and stayed on gamely for show. TWENTY GAUGE dueled to
 quarter pole but weakened in the drive. INDY RHYTHM never a menace. VINTAGE TIME had an awkward start and failed to threaten.

 BLUE MESA just off leader throughout, rallied outside while all out and surged to the wire with the rider almost coming out of his irons from the effort.
 TOMAHAWK KITTEN loped along on the lead to the stretch, put to a drive in the late stages but could not hold off the charge from the winner and nipped on
 the wire. ESCALERA no speed to the far turn, rallied with a mild gain in the drive. PISTOL BOX raced along to the stretch with a very mild bid late in the
 drive. MAXIMUM FORCE never far back to the half but dropped back thereafter. MOSCOW MINISTER turned in a dull effort. GATTO ROSSO chased pace
 for three quarters and gave way readily.
