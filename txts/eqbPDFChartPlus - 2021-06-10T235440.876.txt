 UH OH BABY dueled inside a rival down the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle that foe to the furlong marker and gradually inched away in
 the final furlong. CAMPAIGNER dueled outside the winner down the backstretch and around the turn, fought back outside that foe in upper stretch, could
 not match that one late but was clearly second best. HIT THE SEAM chased three deep on the backstretch and turn, came into the lane three wide, could
 not muster the needed rally but held off a rival to hold third. BUCK DUANE chased a bit off the rail on the backstretch and turn and inside a rival through the
 lane and lacked the needed rally. BLACKHAWK BEAUTY chased between horses into the turn, came into the lane between foes, angled out in the stretch
 and did not threaten.

 FLASH HENRY prominently placed from off the rail early, stalked three wide into the stretch, collared pacesetter under urging nearing eighth marker and
 drew clear under steady handling. CAL CAL LI GOWCHIS quickly sped to clear lead, set uncontested pace from the inside, came two wide into the lane,
 was overtaken just outside furlong marker and could not go with winner late. BUCKY GOLDSTEIN settled along the inside, hugged the rail throughout and
 clearly proved best of others. GUMMY bumped with inside rival early, chased four wide into the bend, continued off the rail to the stretch and lacked needed
 response while coming in some late. SIR PORFIRIO unhurried from the inside, saved ground chasing the pace, angled off the rail leaving the bend and
 failed to menace. TIBBENS SECRET bumped with outside rival early, chased three wide into the bend, came in slightly around the bend, gave way readily
 in upper stretch, was eventually eased and walked off.

 HARROVIAN settled three deep into initial turn, stalked from outside, made steady progress around last turn, came four wide into the lane, collared leaders
 nearing eighth marker and pulled clear under urging. SECOND GEAR forced the pace into and through the backstretch, challenged outside leader on the
 second turn, battled for control in upper stretch, could not go with winner late but edged away to prove second best. FALL HARVEST caught three wide on
 first turn, moved up on same path around second turn and into the stretch, remained off the rail and was along late for minor award. HARD ARCH between
 rivals early, tracked pace from bit off the rail, shifted four wide leaving last turn and failed to seriously threaten late. LUCKY WITH YOU set pressured pace
 from the inside, remained along the rail into the lane, fought back in upper stretch and past eighth marker then weakened some. MAJESTIC JOURNEY
 stalked from along the rail, continued inside throughout and lacked needed response. COLONEL GOTHAM chased from the outside, continued four wide
 into second bend then three wide into the stretch, gave way readily in the lane, was eased late and walked off.

 pace then tracked leaders from bit off the rail, remained two wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed late response. AGLIMPSEOFGABBY settled well
 off the rail, chased three wide on the turn and into the stretch, lugged in badly through the entire stretch and weakened. MR. ARAIZA reserved while outside

 Footnotes
 MAGICAL LUCY settled outside then was four wide into the bend, swung out six wide entering the stretch, closed strongly from the far outside, swept past
 rivals passing eighth marker and drew clear. SAUSALITO SUNSET was bumped and jostled at the start, chased inside, came out in upper stretch, closed
 then loomed in mid stretch and edged away for the place. FAMILY RULES forced the early issue while four deep into the turn, continued prominently three
 wide into the lane, battled between rivals but was out finished. FORTHE LOVOF PATTY forced the pace from along the rail, continued inside into the
 stretch, challenged nearing eighth marker and was out finished for third. GHOST LADY settled while slightly off the rail, came two wide into the lane, angled
 out slightly in the drive and proved best of the rest. MY PROJECT GIRL broke in then dueled early from between foes, was taken off the pace, then raced
 four wide leaving the turn and weakened. SLIGHTLY stalked from off the rail then there wide, shifted five wide entering the stretch and lacked any response.
 MISS FIREBALL emerged from between rivals to gain lead into the turn, set pressured pace around the bend, dropped back in the drive, came in and faded.
 E Z MISS was bumped and jostled leaving the gate, dropped well back early, chased inside and never reached contention.-+.
