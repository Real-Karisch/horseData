 WE WILL RE JOYCE sped to the early lead off the rail, dueled outside the runner-up leaving the backstretch and on the turn and through the stretch and
 gamely prevailed under urging. LA CHEPIS broke out and bumped a rival in a bit of a slow start, went up inside to duel for the lead, fought back along the
 rail through a stiff drive and continued gamely to the wire. SUGARATSUNDOWN stalked between horses then off the rail on the turn, came three wide into
 the stretch and bested the others. INNYMINNIEMINEYMOE bumped at the start, was between horses early then stalked a bit off the rail, dropped back on
 the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and weakened. DREAM OF EAGLES stalked three deep on the backstretch and turn, came four wide into the
 stretch and also weakened.

 HAWKS PEAK sped to the early lead and angled in, set the pace inside then a bit off the rail, fought back into and on the second turn and into the stretch,
 inched away under urging in the drive and proved best. RAINBOW SQUALL three deep on the first turn, stalked off the rail then bid outside the winner
 leaving the backstretch and on the second turn and into the stretch, could not match that one in the drive but was clearly second best. CURLY'S
 WATERFRONT saved ground chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and bested the others. RUN LIKE RHETT a step slow to begin, angled in outside
 a rival then was forced out on the first turn, chased three deep, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. POPULAR KID steadied and came out off
 heels on the first turn, chased off the rail then between foes on the second turn and three wide into the stretch and did not rally. SALDAMENTE between
 foes early, was pulled up on the first turn and vanned off. QUARTER MILE HAND TIMED.

 DREAM TREE stalked three deep, bid outside the winner on the backstretch then stalked again, re-bid alongside that one into the stretch to gain the lead,
 inched away in midstretch and won clear under a steady hand ride and a hold late while drifting in. YESTERDAY'S NEWS sped to the early lead outside,
 angled in and set the pace a bit off the rail, inched away inside on the backstretch and second turn, came off the rail into the stretch, fought back inside the
 winner in upper stretch, drifted in and was clearly second best. PIEDI BIANCHI stalked outside a rival or between horses, continued alongside a rival on the
 second turn, came out into the stretch, also drifted in some and weakened. EXUBERANCE saved ground stalking the pace throughout and also weakened
 in the drive.

 Footnotes
 BEAUMARCHAIS sent between horses early, angled in and set the pace inside then a bit off the rail to the stretch, drew away under urging and proved
 best. JUST KIDDING came off the rail on the first turn, chased off the inside then a bit off the rail on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and
 gained the place late. CHRIS AND DAVE pulled and stalked off the rail then outside a rival leaving the backstretch, continued off the inside on the second
 turn and three deep into the stretch and bested the others. CITY STEEL settled outside a rival then three deep on the backstretch, continued off the inside
 on the second turn and three wide into the stretch and did not rally. RED CARPET CAT four wide into the first turn, stalked off the inside, came four wide
 into the stretch and lacked the necessary response. GROUND RULES chased just off the rail then between foes on the backstretch, dropped back on the
 second turn and weakened. DADTAUGHTMEWELL angled in and saved ground stalking the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and had little left for the
 drive.
