 Footnotes
 SEATTLE ENCOUNTER settled off the raill, angled out on the turn, rallied outside ASTUTELY and drew clear. ASTUTELY set the pace a bit off the rail into
 and around the turn, lost command in the stretch and held the place. UNION LEGEND pulled from the inside early, asked on the turn but lacked room and
 steadied into the stretch, continued willingly along the inside but could not get up for the place. CONFIRMED tracked the pace a bit off the rail, bid between
 rivals leaving the turn, angled out near the eighth pole, looked to advance but got blocked and checked behind ASTUTELY and SEATTLE ENCOUNTER at
 the sixteenth pole, shifted out and kept to task to the wire. POINTSETTIA PARK pressed from the outside in the early going, chased the leader outside a
 rival on the turn, in tight between rivals entering the stretch and weakened. WHAT WE DOING raced off the rail up the backstretch, angled in entering the
 turn, came out in the stretch and never threatened.

 Footnotes
 PAPA CABALLERO stumbled and bumped with READY EDDIE at the start, pressed from the outside, moved up on even terms with HES KNOT UNUSUAL
 around the turn, came three wide into the lane, battled through the stretch and dug in late to get up. HES KNOT UNUSUAL sent for the lead, set the pace
 up the backstretch, dueled around the turn and through the final furlong, resisted late but was bested at the wire. ADVANTAGEOUS shifted out and bumped
 rival then steadied off the heels of KES KNOT UNUSUAL in the beginning , stalked the pace to the turn, raced two wide then angled over to the rail, rallied
 along the inside was too late. HEAT THINGS UP chased along the inside, lost ground on the turn and weakened. ANGRY BOBBY bumped and lost path at
 the start, unhurried in the early going, saved ground around the turn and proved no menace. READY EDDIE bumped at the start, traveled off the rail, three
 wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

 the place. KALUHLA vied three deep to the lane and was outfinished past the sixteenth pole. PICK ONE bumped and shuffled back at the start, raced along
 the inside, angled out in the stretch and produced a late bid. FOUR GAELS between rivals early, lost ground and chased two wide to the lane and finished
