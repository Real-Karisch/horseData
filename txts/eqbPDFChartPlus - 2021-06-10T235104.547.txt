 Footnotes
 SUPER SWISS advanced turning for home and battled through the lane then finished gamely to prevail. SURE SWEET lunged some at the break, moved
 up between rivals on the turn, raced in the five path into the stretch and finished willingly while needing a bit more late. BUGGY BROWN drew clear in the
 run to the turn, set the pace and weakened in the drive. RISKY VENTURE saved ground into the turn, moved off the inside for the drive and lacked the
 needed response. DEL MAR'S JOURNEY chased and tired in the drive. BROMANCE outside into the turn, was four wide into the stretch and had no rally.

 had nothing left and faded. SPRING SPRUNG raced outside, lacked a bid and was outrun. BLUE GESSAMI stalked the pace to the turn and gave way.
