 Footnotes
 ICY INTERLUDE rushed hard and cleared early, angled to the rail mid turn, was kept to task holding safe. HONKEYTONK MAN was out sprinted by the
 winner for the lead, stalked to top of the stretch, angled out giving chase under a drive, was slowly closing in late to finish a willing second. BANTRY BOY
 showed good early foot, stalked along the rail throughout, won the battle for third place in a hard try. STUNT DOUBLE raced up close around the turn,
 moved out four wide being hard ridden in mid stretch, needed more late and was edged for third place. ALYCAR FLASH tracked around the turn, failed to
 respond when asked, held spot. KID ORY settled in the second flight, roused to no avail, no threat. CHIEF MANGO lacked speed, showed little. STREET
 GRAY was quickly outrun, lagged far behind in a poor effort.

 Footnotes
 MIZ MACHEN broke sharply, led throughout, widened in the final furlong and was in hand at the finish. MOM'S MAGIC stalked around the bend running in
 the three path, gave chase finishing a game second. DIXIE'S DANCE broke well, stalked along the inside, tired in the lane saving third. BECOMING
 MACHEN was a step slow into stride, rushed a bold move mid turn, failed to sustain bid and flattened out mid stretch. CALIMONCO'S HEART flashed brief
 early foot, chased from the quarter pole, tired in upper stretch. FORTY CAL. lacked speed, raced mid track, showed little. WILL'S BECOMING stopped in
 upper stretch, finished the course and walked off.

 GLORIOUS RIDE sent hard setting a pressured pace, held on late under strong urging. DANG IT DOROTHY pressed mid turn running between foes, came
 again nearing the wire missing in a game effort. STORMIN MARGARET showed good early foot, pressed mid turn racing three wide, needed more late
 while just holding the show position. HONOR BAR rated early running towards the rear, swung out seven wide in upper stretch, surged late missing third.
 GELATO GAL well placed saving ground, asked from the quarter pole, lacked response. MY VICTAURUSECRET raced evenly in mid pack, hard ridden into
 the stretch, no late kick. SHESA BAD BAD GIRL tracked mid turn, lacked response in the lane. DIXIE ROSE was quickly outrun, raced wide into the stretch,
 no factor.

 pace taking a short lead on the turn, clear in upper stretch would dig in to outside pressure near the wire being out gamed late. MARTIN MAN slow early
 raced inside to upper stretch rallying in the two path closing the gap steadily late. REATA'S CASTLE saved ground racing evenly failing to menace. UTANA
 sluggish from the outset bore out on the turn coming ten wide in upper stretch showing interest well after the fact. SUPER GARNER pressed while in close
 to the turn, ceded there fading near mid track in upper stretch. ST MUFASA was always outrun.
