 Footnotes
 SUNDAY CLOTHES attended the pace along the inside, shifted out to commence his bid between runners leaving the second turn, battled on through a stiff
 drive and was all out to best his stable mate by the narrowest margin. KINGDOM'S GATE settled in hand, looped up five wide to make a bold bid, fought
 hard through the final furlong but missed on the last bob. COLOMBIANO set the pressured pace toward the inside, disputed the issue to the final furlong,
 was unable to go on with the top two, but stayed on to maintain the minor award. ACCUSING prompted the pace three wide, but weakened between rivals
 in the drive and faded. ACESANDSPADES contended between horses, tipped out four wide to make a mild bid leaving the second turn but failed to sustain
 the drive. COMPROMISE contended four wide, was collared between runners after five furlongs, was caught in tight and steadied near the five-sixteenths
 pole and came up empty thereafter. BOASTFUL BOY was slow into stride and was never a factor.

 VIA FRATTINA settled off of the inside, tipped out five wide with three furlongs to run, made a sweeping move five wide into the stretch, forged command a
 furlong out and shook clear. SUMMERTIME GAL was forwardly placed four wide, drew even entering the stretch, kept on well but was unable to go on with
 the winner. RED SPOTS was squeezed at the start and unhurried into stride, wheeled out leaving the second turn, finished well and was along to earn the
 show. IN FOCUS sent clear and angled in to set the pace, was headed entering the stretch and weakened in the drive. BRILLIANT KITTEN was close up
 between horses, came three wide but flattened in the final furlong. KOOKABURRA contended along the inside to the stretch and faded. RHO
 CASSIOPEIAE failed to make headway. RUNAWAY SCARLETT was never a factor. BRIXTON was slow into stride, was taken up on the first turn, pulled up

 Footnotes
 TAKIN THE SLOROAD came away slow, pulled to contention along the inside, took over midway through the second turn, got through and drew away.
 HURRICANE PASS was forwardly placed off of the inside, was unable to go on with the winner, but kept on well to clearly proved second best.
 THELASTTHUNDER settled in hand, circled five wide to make his bid, and finished willingly to earn the show. BLUEGRASS BEAT broke a step slow, was
 allowed to settle, advanced five wide through the second turn and improved position. NO BARNEYS was close up four wide through the second turn and
 tired. EPHRAM S settled between horses, finished with a belated improvement, but was never a factor. CANDY CHANT was unhurried, swung nine wide
 but passed only the tiring ones. BLUEMYMIND failed to respond. JUSTFOLLOWMYLEAD set the pace three wide to the second turn, was headed before
 going six furlongs and gave way readily. ROOFTOP VIEW was through after a half.
