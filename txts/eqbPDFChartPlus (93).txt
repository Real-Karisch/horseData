 Footnotes
 KENDYL ELIZABETH settled in the two path, advanced on the final turn, rallied wide in the stretch, dueled through the final furlong in a determined score.
 FLIPPITY FLOP lacked speed, rallied three wide, led briefly in mid-stretch but was outfinished. LAYLA'S VOYAGE stalked the leaders outside, movd to the
 front on the final turn but came up empty late. LOVE THAT CHICK saved ground close up, steadied briefly outside at the top of the stretch and retreated.
 PASTICHE moved closer inside into the far turn then gave way. OUR JULIET set a clear pace inside, was collared on the final turn and stopped. OCEAN
 COURT chased inside and weakened after a quarter mile. GEORGIA BONNET dropped back along the rail and faltered. DESIROUS lagged far behind
 throughout. SOFT LANDING broke in a complete tangle and was eased soon afterward. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race with no
 action taken. A claim of foul by the fourth finisher against the third finisher for interference at the top of the stretch was dismissed.

 Footnotes
 LOOKINGFORANEWHOME, very wide throughout, took the lead nearing sixteenth marker and edged away. OK NOW saved ground to turn, swung out and
 gained place. KING'S HOUSE didn't break sharply, saved ground, took the lead in early stretch, drifted out then faded. RECANTED raced wide and failed to
 menace. THE POOCH stalked from the five path and tired. BUTCH CASSIDY set the pace well off the rail then had little left. WILD MAN broke slowly and
 trailed throughout. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF OK NOW AGAINST LOOKINGFORANEWHOME FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
 QUARTER POLE WAS QUICKLY DISMISSED.

 Footnotes
 RIGHTEOUS inside early, angled three wide before quarter mile, bid on the turn, drew clear in the final eighth and lasted. RIDE ON FAITH dropped far
 behind, moved out advancing in the stretch but was too late. DISRUPTOR dueled along the inside to mid-stretch and weakened. THE ITALIAN forced the
 pace outside, between rivals at the quarter pole then flattened out. BLAME US ALL advanced four wide on the turn, led narrowly and came up empty.
 DRIVE ON dropped back in the two path and was never a factor. STORM TALES saved ground off the pace and faded steadily. P J'S BAD BOY lacked
 speed very wide and was never in contention.

 WILL MUNNINGS, three wide, took the lead soon after the start, set the pace in three path and drew out. HEY JABBER JAW, outside winner, was unable to
 keep pace. CREDO saved ground and fought back for show. HELLOITSME broke slowly, raced very wide and failed to menace. HAMMERS VISION, two
 wide and just off the early pace, tired. TAIRNEACH broke slowly and only flashed brief speed. SAMURAI ZIP broke slowly then never threatened. BADUKE
 was never a serious factor.

 CROWDER lacked speed, made a menacing wide move on the turn thn flattened out. CLEAR PROSPERITY saved ground off the pace and proved empty
 in the stretch. D'YER MAK'ER raced close up between rivals and gradually weakened. EBO STRONG chased wide down the backstretch and turn and gave
 way. WARRIOR LAKE hustled to the front inside, stopped on the turn and was eased in the stretch. He subsequently returned to the paddock, collapsed

 SAINT MAIN EVENT, very wide throughout, quickly took the lead leaving the turn and drew off under strong handling. PEACH ALLEY, just off the rail and
 just off pace, split rivals entering the stretch but failed to sustain her bid. SMOKINPADDYLASSIE set the early pace in the three path and then weakened
 late. FORMAL CLASS, outrun to stretch, passed faders while racing along the rail. IGNITE, in the three path and not far back, tired. ROLL ON BIG MAMA,
 three wide prompting the early pace, gave way leaving the turn. GRAZEN HONOR, wide, failed to menace. RAPIDEZ, four wide and just off the early pace,
 tired. AUSSIE MIST broke sharply, moved closer to the rail, dueled in the four path then stopped.

 Footnotes
 SMOOTH DON B took control inside, widened on the turn and stayed safe under moderate pressure. DEAD BROKE chased behind the leaders, angled
 wider on the turn, rallied and continued willingly. BUZZ WITH ALEX pursued the pacesetter inside and flattened out through the stretch. D. S. BOYD
 dropped far behind then offered some late energy inside. BLINDING prompted the pace three wide then came up empty in the stretch. SON OF SANIBEL
 trailed early then passed rivals without menacing. FREEMARK chased the pacesetter outside then began fading on the turn. C K DEXTER HAVEN dropped
 back outside and stopped abruptly. GIANT ROCKS saved ground off the pace and gave way readily.
