 Footnotes
 FEELIN FOXIE vied three wide between rivals early then asserted herself and pulled clear leaving the far turn, dropped in and set a rated pace, kept on
 under right handed rousing past the furlong grounds, switched over to her correct lead with about a sixteenth remaining and held firm under a steady hand
 ride late. NINA'S PATIENCE , with the early pace four deep, stalked three wide mid turn and held well through the drive. WIGGLE ROOM had speed to the
 inside of rivals then was rated back nearing the turn, eased out three wide for the drive, moved up some in mid stretch then flattened out. ROMANTIC BABE
 had speed between runners then eased back off the leaders near the half mile pole, dropped back after steadying near the far turn, was fanned four wide by
 the loose horse entering the lane, drifted in slightly and came up empty. GRACE ISABELLA , four to five wide, failed to menace. THALIA'S SONG , up close
 behind rivals, stumbled and checked sharply into the turn, angled in to make some progress nearing the lane, steadied in upper stretch then lacked a further
 response. OUT OF JUICE broke a step slow, checked entering the turn and failed to recover. HOLD THAT KISS vied three wide between rivals, chased
 around the turn, shifted in and gave way. IT'S A DOOZY broke a step slow, steadied soon after, was taken up near the far turn and failed to menace.
 TEMPLE SKY flashed speed inside, eased back to track then stumbled when in tight and lost her rider entering the turn. There was a stewards' inquiry into
 the run into the turn, no action was taken.

 MAKEANENTRANCE steadied soon after the break, settled off the pace and outside a rival, commenced a three wide run leaving the far turn, moved
 menacingly past the five sixteenths then failed to seriously sustain. CHARISMATIC BLUE saved ground off the pace, was stalled behind a tiring rival mid
 way on the final turn, swung out and had late interest. EXECUTIONERS TERMS , forced in some early, vied between rivals, led past the five eighths,
 dueled into the far turn and weakened near the quarter pole. KAMEHAMEHA , away alertly, disputed the pace inside rivals and weakened leaving the five

 Footnotes
 BEYOND FOREVER , bumped and steadied at the break, regrouped and settled off the pace and off the inside, took closer order into the far turn, chased
 the dueling leaders three wide into the lane, worked through a seam between rivals in the final sixteenth, forged to command late and prevailed under a
 drive. SETUBAL prompted the pace three and four wide outside QUEEN NEKIA, drew on near even terms past the quarter pole, dueled under strong
 handling and gained a slim advantage nearing the eighth pole, kept on gamely but just wasn't quite good enough. QUEEN NEKIA cleared early, set a slow
 pace off the inside, was under a drive maintaining command past the five sixteenths, sparred with SETUBAL from the quarter pole and stayed on well.
 STAKES ON A PLANE broke outward and bumped the winner, corrected and moved up to stalk the leaders, bid four to five wide nearing the quarter pole,
 failed to match strides leaving three sixteenths and hung late. UNTAKEN , in hand three deep off the pace, circled six wide into the stretch and came up
 empty. UNLUCKY HILLARY saved ground off the pace, was under a drive mid way on the final turn, eased out and lacked a solid bid. MIXWAYS , well
 placed tracking the leaders inside, was under pressure into the lane and faded in the final furlong.

 Footnotes
 ANYTIME ANYPLACE was sent clear early then taken to rate, set the pace towards the rail, edged away a bit under a drive past the three sixteenths, dug in
 when confronted a sixteenth out, kept on tenaciously under stout left handed rousing and proved best. RAPID DAN advanced inside nearing the turn and
 gained a stalking spot, eased out soon into the stretch, ranged up outside the winner with a sixteenth remaining, dueled and hung. JOSEPH was lightly
 steadied in the opening sixteenth, drafted towards the rail leaving the far turn, stayed inside and progressed inside rivals past the furlong grounds, continued
 willingly but had to steady when lacking room late. INDIAN BUCKS rated in the clear in mid pack mid turn, swung five wide for the drive, ranged up past the
 sixteenth pole but hung late. CALL WIL stalked three to four wide, moved up between rivals leaving the sixteenth marker but failed to sustain. GOLDEN
 EMPEROR edged up outside rivals early on and stalked the winner, chased three wide between rivals leaving the eighth pole and faded. MY ENIGMA
 broke a step slow, eased back from between runners leaving the far turn, saved ground nearing the lane, angled out but lacked a solid run. OKLAHOMA
 CRUDE , inside, was not a factor. ODLUM , wide, faded. UNUSUAL FLEET saved ground and failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 JERICHO MARSH eased off the inside past the three quarter and was taken well in hand while measuring the leader, went after that one into the far turn,
 quickly opened up leaving the three eighths, turned away an inside challenge from FLEET ADMIRAL in mid stretch then held sway under right handed
 rousing. FLEET ADMIRAL settled outside early on, advanced three wide past the five sixteenths, shifted in soon into the lane, briefly threatened the winner
 in mid stretch, failed to match strides but continued willingly to be well clear for the place. LOVELY GAMES rated inside while not far back, eased out and
 made a mild run between rivals after six furlongs, dropped back in towards the rail and flattened out. SIR SMARTY , in close at the break, recovered and
 settled off the pace and removed from the inside, gained three wide approaching the stretch but needed more in the final furlong. RED MIST (ARG) saved
 ground off the early pace, was put to a ride nearing the half mile marker, angled out leaving the three eighths and faded. VALLEY CAL , between rivals
 leaving the far turn, weakened. STORMY PATRIOT came out at the break tightening SIR SMARTY, dropped well off the pace, angled out for the drive but
 failed to threaten. WILIAM H gave early chase three wide and faltered. SURVOYANT was sent wide to clear rivals into the first turn, angled in and set the
 pace, gave little resistance leaving the far turn and faltered.

 Footnotes
 HOME RUN MAKER , well handled between rivals early, shifted in and stalked past the half, eased back out and took the measure of the leader leaving the
 five sixteenths, responded when roused left handed in upper stretch, drew alongside FORCED leaving the eighth pole, dueled, took command past the
 sixteenth marker and was edging away late under steady handling. FORCED , bumped at the break, sped clear early, set a strong pace under some
 coaxing and towards the rail, was pushed along for his best soon into the lane, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, dueled inside the winner through the
 final sixteenth and gave way grudgingly. POLAR JET , between rivals nearing the turn, dropped in to advance mid turn, angled back out for the drive, moved
 up while drifting out some in mid stretch then hung in deep stretch. BO VUK broke a step slow, settled well back, angled five wide into the lane, was lightly
 brushed when straightening, angled in gaining past the eighth pole, split rivals and finished full of run. COUSIN JIMMY broke a step slow, advanced four
 wide to be in range leaving the far turn, chased then flattened out. SO LONG CHUCK flashed speed then was shuffled back inside, angled out and
 advanced three wide nearing the lane, shifted in and came up empty. CORREJON , brushed at the break, rushed up between rivals, chased and gave way.
 GREAT COUNTRY angled out mid turn and failed to menace. STOMP DANCE broke awkwardly and bumped with a rival, moved up and pursued the
 leader, raced between rivals past the five sixteenths and tired.

 rousing near the three sixteenths, forged to command nearing the sixteenth marker, kicked clear and was taken in hand through the final fifty yards. IF I
 WAS A BOY settled outside the winner, moved with that one approaching the stretch, failed to initially quicken, shifted further out and closed willingly to gain
 the place. NOT IN JEOPARDY broke a step slow, was taken firmly in hand while saving ground, moved up inside foes in upper stretch, altered off heels
 near mid stretch and rallied between runners. FLY was rated back in the opening furlong, steadied entering the turn, angled out and rallied between foes.
 DO WHAT I SAY , sluggish from the gate, was unhurried early, commenced a wide run mid turn, steadied and shifted out near the five sixteenths, corrected
 and rallied wide. KEEP YOUR DISTANCE broke a step slow then was gunned to the front, relaxed when clear nearing the turn, took pressure around the
 turn, kicked back clear inside the quarter pole, could not resist the swarm leaving mid stretch and weakened. UNAQUOI , four wide early, vied between
 rivals around the turn and faded in the final furlong. EYE ON BERLIN , five wide early, forced the pace outside foes around the turn, remained a presence to
 mid stretch then weakened. WISE GAL rated close up, angled four wide in upper stretch and weakened. SWEET YARE N DIRA had speed inside foes,
 tracked around the turn, remained forward to the eighth pole then gave way.

 ZIG ZILLION was sent clear early then taken to rate, dictated the pace towards the inside, opened up after being set down in upper stretch and was much
 the best while kept to task. JAMMER , bumped at the break, settled off the pace, awaited some room in upper stretch, swung out and finished up willingly to
