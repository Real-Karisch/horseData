 Footnotes
 RIVER LIGHT broke sharply, tracked close up inside, was shuffled back slightly on the turn, made a strong three wide run at the quarter pole, quickly pulled
 away under urging and then taken in hand late. SHANGHAI MISTRESS set the pace racing with a clear lead, was no match for the winner and clear for the
 place spot. DUTCHESS CAROLINE broke a step slowly, quickly recovered and stalked three wide, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. CANDY FOR
 ALL raced off the pace, three wide on the turn and had no rally. ASYENA was off slowly, outrun early, moved up four wide passing the quarter pole and had
 no rally. MS. GENUINE raced off the pace, inside on the turn and was outrun. VALID TREASURE bobbled at the break, chased outside and gave way.
