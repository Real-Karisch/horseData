 Footnotes
 MAGNETO was rated just out of striking distance while angling inside early, steadily drew into contention along the rail on the turn, switched out in upper
 stretch while being roused briskly to close the gap on the leader and narrowly prevailed between foes on the wire. SPUR, urged to dispute the pace inside a
 rival from the outset, shifted off the rail once gaining the advantage, set the pace to upper stretch while angling back to the inside and continued under
 withering pressure to just miss. JACK MORMON bobbled, then was bumped at the start, settled out of striking distance, was urged to advance four wide
 racing into the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while edging a rival for a share. BUXTON broke inwards
 bumping JACK MORMON, was collected to track just off the first flight in the opening quarter, switched out nearing upper stretch to bid three deep between
 foes and continued willingly to the end to close the gap. GLORIOUS SUMMER was outpaced early and proved no threat. DEFENDER OF HEARTS broke
 sharply, was urged to force the pace racing into the turn but gave way early.

 Footnotes
 ALPINE GATHERING was urged to terms prompting the pace along the rail, dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn into upper stretch and edged
 forward under firm handling. QUALITY INDEED joined the pace three wide in early stages, pressed the issue outside the eventual winner to upper stretch
 but proved only second best. RED CORVETTE was rated along the inside tracking just off the first flight to the far turn, shifted out three wide racing into
 upper stretch and continued with a mild bid. HANDSOME JACKSON, reserved well off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, steadily
 gathered momentum on the inside through the far turn, angled out to split foes entering upper stretch and made a mild gain between foes.
 TRANSFORMATIVE tracked the pace between foes in the second flight, shifted out three wide entering the far turn to lodge a brief bid but flattened out in
 the drive. PASCHAL, reserved between foes in the opening stages, saved ground on the far turn and passed inside some tiring foes.
 ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY, forwardly placed between foes in the first flight racing to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. BEER SHERIFF settled between
 foes in the last flight early and offered no rally. SHEER TRICK broke slowly and failed to menace. YA ANTABTTSY was a brief factor three wide in the
 second flight but was through after a half. HEISENBERG, caught wide early, proved no threat.

 Footnotes
 HARNERSBACH was hustled up the rail soon after the break setting the pace on a clear margin into the turn, came under stout right handed pressure
 racing past midstretch and grudgingly held the challenge of CHESTNUT JOHNNY to the end. The latter was prompted to gain a position within striking
 distance between foes in the second flight early, worked his way to the inside racing into the turn, switched out in upper stretch while being roused to
 challenge the leader but was just outkicked. SIR NAVIGATOR was eased back from a position in the second flight along the inside racing into the turn,
 shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and continued with a mild bid. GLACKEN'S GHOST angled nearer to the inside
 in the opening quarter while tracking off the second flight, shifted to the rail on the turn, advanced through close quarters nearest the rail into upper stretch
 and made mild progress inside rivals to the end. BEAR'S BIG BOY was settled off the second flight early, angled to the inside on the turn and made an
 effort to improve position in late stages. SUPER CHARLIE, urged to gain a forward placing four wide, then three wide in the second flight racing into the
 turn, steadily weakened entering upper stretch. POETIC POSER broke a bit awkwardly, then settled last, switched outside foes racing into the turn, was
 fanned five wide into the stretch and proved no threat. POCKETBALL tracked the pacesetter between foes in the second flight racing to the turn and gave
 way into upper stretch. SMOLTZ, reserved off the second flight in the opening stages while racing off the inside into the turn, offered no rally.

 HOT SHOT KID broke sharply, joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue to gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, then
 shook clear through the final furlong while being kept to firm encouragement. FRIDAYNITESTAR, reluctant to load in the starting gate, broke slowly, was
 quickly righted to track off the first flight four wide racing into the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch while being prompted to advance, couldn't gain
 terms with the winner but proved best of the others. RICHARD THOMAS was settled off the second flight remaining off the inside into the turn, swung out
 five wide nearing upper stretch and finished evenly while prevailing for a share. GOT EVEN SMARTER, urged to press the pace between foes from the
 outset, vied inside the winner to upper stretch but emptied out in late stages. DEVIL'S TEETH angled to the inside early tracking off the first flight but came
 up empty racing into upper stretch. LET DA COWBOY ROCK was outpaced early. PRAYINTHEPRAIRIE was urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the
 outset into the turn but gave way after a half.

 Footnotes
 BOREALIS BEAUTY was prompted to gain a position tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted out three wide leaving the midway point of
 the bend while readily advancing to challenge for command, took over nearing midstretch and kicked clear late under some mild urging and a few right
 handed taps. BALL AND CHAIN sped to the fore soon after the break while angling to the inside, dictated terms on a narrow margin on her own courage
 racing into the turn, was prompted to resist the winner's bid but soon proved no match while clearly best of the others. DIVA'S RULE, urged along between
 foes in the second flight in pursuit of the leaders, lost some ground on the turn but continued willingly between foes to late stages to edge a rival for a share.
 PEACEFUL APPROACH, off last, quickly recovered to gain a position tracking the leaders three deep in the second flight, was fanned four wide nearing
 upper stretch while advancing on the leaders in tandem with the eventual winner but lacked the needed final kick. TEELFA was settled off the second flight
 while angling over a bit, saved ground into upper stretch and passed tiring rivals late. SHE'SABREES was rated off the second flight while shifting to the
 outside early, raced four, then five wide to upper stretch and had no rally. HOT AND DANGEROUS was urged to terms pressing a rival's pace, then dueled
 between foes on the turn but gave way in upper stretch.

 Footnotes
 RASPBERRY PUNCH was urged to secure the lead along the inside racing into the first turn to set the pace on a narrow margin, dueled inside a rival into
 the far turn to gain a narrow advantage and just lasted under brisk handling. HIT IT UP tracked just off the leaders while angling inside early, shifted out
 three wide nearing upper stretch while moving to challenge the leaders, continued willingly to late stages and edged a rival for the place honors.
 ELEVENPOINT RIVER tracked the pacesetter between foes in the opening quarter, moved to press that foe before a half, continued in a protracted skirmish
 past midstretch but weakened nearing the wire. NOMOREHAPPY settled into stride shifting a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch but failed to
 menace. POPGOESTHEWEASEL was urged to brief contention, four, then three wide into the backstretch but soon dropped out. HEY HEY was checked
 abruptly in the opening sixteenth, was soon outdistanced, walked to the unsaddling area on her own power after the race, than got loose from her handlers
 post-race.
