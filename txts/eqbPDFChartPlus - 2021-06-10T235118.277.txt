 QUEEN TO CHECKMATE stalked the pace, circled the turn four wide, took the lead in upper stretch and dug in late under brisk urging to prevail. PRANK
 CALL , forced in by HUNK BUNKA BROWN leaving the starting gate, lacked room in the two path mid way on the turn, swung to the five path turning for
 home and gamely rallied outside the winner. PRESENTER , two wide on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and rallied mildly. SHECOR saved ground on
 the turn, eased out in upper stretch and passed tired horses. YOUNGER GIRL , three wide between horses disputing the pace to the stretch, weakened.
 DAD'S CITY GIRL disputed the pace two wide for the three furlongs then faltered. HUNKA BUNKA BROWN bore in leaving the starting gate, hugged the
 inner rail, disputed the pace and faltered.

 Footnotes
 HEY WILLIE was sent up to the inside of INEXCESS AGAIN early on and moved clear after a furlong, set a rated pace two wide, was shaken up soon into
 the lane, kept on under repeated left handed encouragement through the final furlong and held off FINAL FORUM. FINAL FORUM bobbled inward at the
 break, drafted back four wide and stalked the pace, came under pressure mid turn, circled four wide making some headway into the stretch, kept on grinding
 through the final furlong but just couldn't quite reel in the leader. SAM SPARKLE was steadied off of the heels of SIR BOND soon after the break, regrouped
 and edged up along the rail past the half mile marker, gave hard chase remaining inside into the lane but came up empty through the final sixteenth. SIR
 BOND drifted in soon after the start, corrected and settled outside a rival, angled six to seven wide for the stretch run and rallied. DODDSPRIVATELABEL ,
 between foes nearing the turn, raced three wide into the stretch, angled out but failed to generate a solid kick. INEXCESS AGAIN bobbled at the break, led
 briefly, stalked the winner three wide, was under coaxing into the stretch and weakened late. NICARADALIC ROCKS saved ground around the turn and
 failed to menace.

 ENGLISH TUDOR , rated well off the dueling leaders, advanced three deep leaving the far turn, secured command in upper stretch, was under energetic
 urging and eagerly pulled away. ZAP CAT disputed the pace outside STOMP DANCE and faded in the drive. STOMP DANCE hugged the inner rail,
 disputed the pace and weakened. CONQUEST FALCON , steadied behind several horses leaving the backstretch, raced three wide between rivals on the
 far turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and passed foes. TRADE THE PICK had a mild three wide advance on the far turn then gave way in the
 stretch. I AIN'T NEVER , shuffled back soon after the break, was outrun. O SAY EYE , a forward factor along the inner rail down the backstretch, gave way.
 FIERY CHALLENGE raced inside horses and was no factor. YES MEANS NO , four wide on the turns, was outrun. REDEEMED GENTLEMAN , unhurried
 early, was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 DOUBLE NAUGHT SPY , keen to the lead, set the pace in the two path while handling outside pressure, shook clear when let out soon into the lane, kept
 on under strong handling through the final eighth and dug in late to hold off MOONSPELL. MOONSPELL chased a contested pace while four wide, was
 under a stout ride mid turn, wandered outward a bit approaching the stretch, was straightened with the right stick, ranged up past mid stretch, drifted out and
 late and continued gamely to gain. FIFTIES MUSIC pressed three wide outside the winner and gave way grudgingly. ARIZONA BABY , taken to rate, saved
 ground leaving the three eighths pole, eased out some in upper stretch but lacked a solid bid. SLICK MAN saved ground stalking the leaders, took closer
 order past the five sixteenths, had dead aim into the lane and faded. CARYSFORT REEF , four to five wide, faded around the turn. TUFFY'S LUCKY , five
 wide, failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 MY SISTERSLEDGE tracked three deep under rating, dropped in a bit and bid in hand nearing the quarter pole, spurted clear after being roused left handed
 leaving the three sixteenths, widened a bit near the sixteenth pole then held firm while kept to task. KITTY'S RIGHT , under a long, but firm hold four wide
 early on, dropped in slightly when edging closer leaving the far turn, moved back out four wide and ranged up to threaten into the lane, could not quicken
 with the winner near the eighth pole but had enough left to save the place. AQUAMARINA (GB) saved ground and was steadied along while rank through
 opening five and a half furlongs, eased out in upper stretch, moved up between rivals near the sixteenth marker but hung a bit late. HOT GIRL angled in
 early and settled off the pace, moved up into the far turn, awaited some room past the three eighths, got through along the rail in upper stretch and churned
 on willingly. SHE DOESN'T MIND (FR) broke awkwardly then was steadied back soon afterward, was a bit rank nearing the first turn, stalked between foes
 mid way on the final turn, angled out for the drive and rallied mildly. OH MY , in tight at the break, raced four wide early, angled five wide for the drive but
 lacked a solid run. MADAME X. set the pace towards the rail, was taken on nearing the lane and weakened in the final furlong. ROYAL CASHMERE
 prompted the pace outside the leader, came under a ride leaving the far turn, stayed on to the head of the lane then retreated.

 Footnotes
 MY COUSIN LOU settled in the clear, angled out and was put to pressure past the three eighths, circled five wide into the lane, rallied under strong handling
 and reeled in the leader in mid stretch, kicked clear with a sixteenth remaining and dug in gamely to fend off BORSA VENTO to his inside. BORSA VENTO ,
 in range between rivals near the half mile marker, remained forward under coaxing and to the outside of a rival approaching the stretch, dropped to the rail
 near the three sixteenths, closed gamely and was steadily getting to the winner. BO VUK , taken to rate, advanced to the inside of a rival mid turn, swung six
 wide for the drive, closed in under a drive past mid stretch but wasn't quite good enough. JUMP JIVE AN WAIL edged up in hand leaving the five eighths
 pole, angled out leaving the far turn, moved menacingly while four deep nearing the five sixteenths, forged clear under a drive leaving the quarter pole, met
 the winner's charge near the eighth pole and faded. RIVINGTON saved ground under rating and in range of the leaders, awaited room past the three
 eighths pole, shifted out past the quarter pole, split rivals leaving the furlong grounds and churned on with interest. ZIG ZILLION prompted the pace two to
 three wide, bid around the far turn, forced the issue to upper stretch and weakened. MAX CROWN , three wide and off the pace, was under pressure
 leaving the half mile marker but failed to respond. DELTA OUTLAW , three to four wide stalking the pace, lodged a mild bid around the turn, stayed on to
 about the quarter pole then gave way. DEAL DRIVEN cleared leaving the chute, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure around the turn and tired.
 BROCKADOODLE drafted back after an alert beginning, secured the rail and found himself well off the lead after a quarter mile, continued inside around the
 turn and into the lane, had his rider switch to the right stick near the three sixteenths pole but failed to muster up a significant response.

 GOTHAM NEWS settled well off the early lead while saving ground, picked up steam and advanced to the inside of a rival departing the far turn, eased out
 mid turn then swung six wide when making a solid run into the lane, moved up to engage NOW WE ARE FREE inside the three sixteenths, dueled outside
 that one from there, gained a slim lead a sixteenth out and prevailed in an extended drive. NOW WE ARE FREE prompted a contested pace three to four
 wide, moved clear entering the lane, dug in when confronted leaving the three sixteenths, battled gamely inside the winner while under fierce left handed
 rousing and missed. SAN CRISTO chased the pace four wide, shifted out some past the quarter pole and gained the show. TURBIN broke a step slow,
 advanced inside nearing the three quarter pole and gained a stalking spot, awaited some room mid turn, got through along the rail and made a run in upper
 stretch, chased past the furlong marker and flattened out late. PLEIADIAN , off the pace four wide, was under pressure mid turn, angled out in the drive and
 had belated interest. BEAUZIGGITY vied two to three wide outside DAYSTRIKE, remained a solid presence past the quarter pole then faded. ALARMING ,
 off the pace, was under a ride three wide mid turn, angled out in upper stretch but lacked a bid. WHO STOLE MY SOCK saved ground chasing the pace
 and faded. DAYSTRIKE set a pressured pace inside, ceded command mid turn and faltered.
