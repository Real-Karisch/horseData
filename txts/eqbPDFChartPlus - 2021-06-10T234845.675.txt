 Footnotes
 ZAP TOWN broke alertly then was allowed to sit just off the pace from a rail position, gained a narrow advantage at the top of the stretch and drew away.
 DRIVE SANDY DRIVE lugged out in the first turn, led the way into the backstretch, was under attack into the far turn and lacked the rally needed. BLACK
 MAGIC RIVER checked in the first turn, tracked inside, rallied mildly and flattened out. FLYING DAGGER was squeezed out early, trailed and passed a
 tiring rival late. PACIORETTY outsprinted to the turn, stalked three-wide, rallied outside in the far turn and tired.

 PICK A PRIZE tracked inside, was checked at the five sixteenth pole along the rail, shifted three-wide then was along in time under mild encouragement.
 SOME GAVE ALL raced wide leaving the turn, pushed clear into the backstretch, held a good advantage into the stretch but was rundown late. HOPEWICK
 trailed early, chased the leaders in the far turn, swung out and closed well. LILLIE ABBIE lacked early foot, raced three-wide in the turn and displayed a mild
 late interest. D'WILDCAT GOLD rushed to vie, settled in range, waited at the top of the stretch and lacked the kick needed. DANGEROUS PURSUIT carried
 wide by SOME GAVE ALL, was roused through the far turn and gave way late.

 Footnotes
 HERO'S GINGER SNAP contested the pace, widened racing into the stretch to win easily. STREET BELLE chased the leader into the far turn and finished
 gamely in vain. TOCCALOT chased, was checked approaching the stretch along the rail and rallied late for show. SHADYDEED quickly went to the front
 then was overtaken and came up empty in the drive. LADY CHARDONNAY raced four-wide in the turn, chased and was roused to no avail. HITHER AND
 YON offered little. FAST FORWARD GAL failed to menace. FILLY'S EGO raced wide into the turn and was outrun. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection
 lodged by the rider of TOCCALOT against the rider of STREET BELLE alleging interference at the top of the stretch was not allowed.

 GO WILD settled midpack, moved closer quickly leaving the backstretch, swept the lead and won going away. STORMCHASER broke alertly, set a
 pressured pace, disposed of HYANNISPORT entering the stretch but was outkicked in the stretch and finished best of the rest. DIZZY MZ TIZZY unhurried
 early, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. GOT TWENTY hurried away, shifted out to the three path and lacked a serious bid.
 HYANNISPORT pressed the pace, was unable to match strides with STORMCHASER and faded steadily in the stretch. FIRST ROUND DRAFT saved
 ground and lacked a serious bid. TRAFFIC TICKET settled in range then was done early and was eased, walked off. **It was reported by the official track
 veterinarian as having TRAFFIC TICKET BLED.

 TIMELESS FLIGHT quickest to the turn, led the way, responded to looming threat and just held under a late drive. DOC saved ground inside, shifted out
 four-wide at the top of the stretch and closed determinedly, just missing. BUCK MAGIC raced three-wide in the turn, moved closer in the three path, loomed
 boldly midstretch but was not good enough late. ABEEL bumped by POLKA DOT RIVER in the first turn, chased the winner and lacked the rally needed
 through the drive. LONG TIME DON chased four to five-wide in the far turn and finished with a belated bid. PASSAGE OF POWER lagged early and
 showed some interest late. POLKA DOT RIVER bumped ABEEL in the turn, tracked inside and finished evenly late. VISION OF ROSES unhurried away,
 raced four-wide in the turn, chased and failed to threaten. CRESENT MCGAIN carried wide then bumped by VISION OF ROSES and failed to recover.
 ROCIANTE no factor.
