 Footnotes
 GOLD LACE bumped lightly with CHA CHA HEELS in the shadow of the starting gate, tucked along the inside, slipped to outside midway on the far turn,
 fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, kicked into stride once straightened away, closed in relentlessly, poking a head down in time at the wire to
 steal away the decision. QUESTEQ tracked the front runners at or near the inside, was forced to await suitable options caught in traffic beginning a few
 jumps shy of the quarter pole, shifted to the outside once into the lane, gained some clearance in midstretch and burst through, fought its way to slim and
 what turned out to be short-lived advantage only to get out-bobbed by the winner at the finish line. VASILIKA three wide on the clubhouse bend, was one
 path wider on the subsequent one, got sent into path five for the stretch run, finished with good courage down the center of the course to take the show.
 CARRY YOUR HEELS three to two wide on the first turn, stalked the loose leader from path two on the second bend, chiseled away at the deficit after
 three-quarters had been completed, was given her cue after settling into upper stretch, fought its way to the lead, although barely, with approximately a
 sixteenth remaining, got swallowed up in deep stretch. CHA CHA HEELS pinched shortly after the start, tucked along the inside, was gradually worked into
 path three after stepping off the backstretch, got maneuvered into path seven during the initial portion of the stretch, becoming the widest of all, made no
 impact with her mild response. DYNAMIC WAR motored to the front primarily taking the three path on the opening bend, cut the pace on open lead, keen
 during the early stages, got guided over to the inside before arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, came under pressure for the first time in upper
 stretch, offered some resistance before relinquishing in the general area of the sixteenth pole then backed away. RIMANISEMPREFORTE loosely pocketed,
 came up empty.

 FUEL THE BERN came away without apparent mishap, got set up in the four path, cruised up towards the front runners during the run around the bend, in
 hand, settled into upper stretch and was let out, began the final furlong as the new leader, extended the winning margin, racing erratically in the final
 sixteenth, mostly shying away from the whip. HERECOMESYOURMAN abandoned the inside route for the two path shortly after departing the backstretch,
 swung into action by swinging four wide into the stretch, closed in readily on the ones to catch, atlered course a couple of paths inward in deep stretch and
 maintaining his momentu, procured the place. ELECTRO brushed with RULE YOURSELF right after the field had been sent off and running, was moved
 into the pocket, was asked to pick up interest getting sent to the outside past the five-sixteenths pole, was ridden three wide into the stretch, proved no
 match and had to settle for the show. NOTJUDGINJUSTSAYIN mostly four wide, came one path wider into the stretch, lacked the needed response. RULE
 YOURSELF made some contact with ELECTRO at the start, was two to three wide in pursuit of the pacesetter on the turn, angled out towards path six from
 upper to midstretch, made no impact. CHANNEL WON pressed the leader from the two path, forged to a narrow lead approaching the quarter pole, was
 asked for more turnnig for home with the eventual winner lurking dangerously to the outside, got overhauled then steadily backed away. SMARTER took up
 the chase two wide and never made its presence felt. GOLDEN AWAY was corrected by the pilot after lunging leftward with its initial step, proceeded along
 the backstretch pulling on the bit early, worked out a tuck along the rail at the half mile pole, got sent six wide approaching the three-sixteenths marker,
 failed to menace. GRIFF'S GHOST along the rail, vied for command until near the quarter pole before faltering. LONE TRAVELER fowardly placed three
 wide, appeared done by the three-sixteenths pole. RED HOT SALSA in the two path and between rivals stepping onto the turn, gave way.

 Footnotes
 NISHA showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, edged away to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail.
 LAMONTAGNE hustled from the start, chased three wide coming under coaxing midway on the turn, continued three wide for home and was nudged,
 leaned on and even elbowed in the face by the rider of VICKI'S DANCER and pushed four wide straightened away for home, dug in under a drive and
 offered up a mild kick to procure the place honors at the finish. VICKI'S DANCER just off the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home behind foes, came out and nudged the aforementioned foe before leaning on that rival as the rider's elbow
 made contact with that foe's face twice and a third time making contact with the rider of LAMONTAGNE while forcing his way to the three path, kept on
 through the stretch to be along for the show honors. READY FOR SUMMER just off the inside near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
 angled three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. AWESOME QUICK rated just off the inside in aim of the leader, came under coaxing
 nearing the quarter pole, continued just off the inside for home and weakened in the late stages. BILLYSCRYSTALBALL chased three to four wide under
 coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, tired. MAKING HAVOC saved ground near the rear, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from
 home, angled out three to four wide at the quarter pole, trailed.

 Footnotes
 NEW YORK HERO vied for command two to three wide, well rated for the opening three-quarters, turned for home poised to strike the front, did indeed do
 so within the next two jumps, had already edged away from DARK OPS when put to a drive, lengthened away, kept busy until the final seventy yards. DARK
 OPS got set up along the inside after the break, contended with the winner for six furlongs, was called upon cutting the corner into the lane, yielded within a
 few additional strides, held off a field lacking closers to preserve the place. ODIN'S STEED took up the chase two wide and never made its presence felt.
 MR. PRESIDENT saved ground on the backstretch, got driven into path four from the top of the bend to the three-eighths pole, commenced the stretch
 slightly wider and proved no match. MANGO M stalked the top twosome from the two path for three-quarters and gave way. ACCOLADE underwent a three
 wide journey to the end of the bend and folded. SCRUTINIZE rode the rail on the turn to no avail. RUNNIN FOR DACE three to four wide on the turn, drifted
 seven wide exiting it.

 IRON POWER inside early on, tipped out three to four wide five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths advancing on the top pair
 nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide at that station seizing command straightened away, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under
 growing late threat and held safe to repel that challenge to the finish. AIRE BUENO (CHI) carried out at the start by ANDALUSITE, settled two to three wide
 near the rear, came under a ride at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth
 but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire. SHALAKO broke out at the start bumping SILVER DAGGER, saved ground nera the rear, tipped out three to four
 wide put to coaxing with three furlongs to run, swung six to seven wide at the head of the stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors.
 ANDALUSITE broke out at the start carrying out AIRE BUENO about two paths, settled three then two wide in mid pack, came under encouragement
 midway on the far turn, swung five wide for home and offered up a mild kick. UNCLE SIGH three wide through the opening dog legged bend, settled three to
 four wide near the rear until tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing past the three-eighths, swung four wide at the quarter pole,
 offered up a mild bid but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. TIZNOBLE four then three wide through the opening dog legged turn, settled three wide in aim
 of the leader stacked outside a pair, had the leader attempt to slip away with half a mile to go and was given some rein before being put to coaxing three
 furlongs out, spun three to four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. BIRCHWOOD ROAD saved ground in mid pack, came under coaxing
 tipped out three wide midway on the far turn, swung five wide for home and offered no response. SILVER DAGGER bumped at the break by SHALAKO
 breaking outwards, established the front into the backstretch and showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure through attendance from a
 pair to the outside, came under light coaxing half a mile from home quickening the pace and attempted to slip off his escorts into the far turn, came under
 ever increasing pressure from that pair, spun just off the inside for home and yielded the front straightened away, then weakened through to the finish.
 DAMAGE CONTROL three wide through the opening turn, attended the pace of the aforementioned foe in hand from the two path between rivals as he was
 joined outside by TIZNOBLE, had the leader attempt to slip away and was given some rein half a mile from home before being put to coaxing at the
 three-eighths to increase the pressure, swung three wide at the quarter pole and tired in the stretch. INVENTOR'S GATE just off the inside in mid pack,
 tucked inside half a mile from home, came under a ride at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 KELSOCAIT came away in good order, got guided into the three path, vied as the widest of three for command, pilot holding something in reserve, was let
 loose spinning into the lane, was once again the widest of three vying for the lead by the beginning of the last eighth, ALL IN FUN having replaced
 PORTMAGEE as a participant in the upcoming tussle that was to have a duration of approximately half a furlong, mustered up good determination and got
 the job done. ALL IN FUN was on hold stalking three front runners from the two path, picked up interest after going a half, was switched over to hand
 encouragement, angled sharply three wide coming up to the furlong grounds, fought from between rivals for the top for next sixteenth, battled hard one on
 one with the winner thereafter but got denied. RUMBLE DOLL the early trailer in the two path, began to step it up after the half had been completed, swung
 five wide heading for midstretch, flashed good, but belated energy en route for the show. MOON RIVER (IRE) disputed the pace in the two path from
 between opponents for a good portion of the trip to the quarter pole, arrived at that station holding a slim advantage, came under pressure after stepping
 into the stretch, surrendered with a bit under an eighth to go, argued for another sixteenth to re-claim it before weakening. JUDY'S CHANCE saved ground,
 was heavily roused cutting the corner into the lane, got spotted two to three wide soon afterwards, lacked the needed response. PORTMAGEE along the
 rail, held off a pair of rivals to the outside until a few jumps shy of the end of the bend, remained prominently placed to the furlong marker then faltered.

 Footnotes
 O CAPTAINMYCAPTAIN four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths latching on a trio at that juncture, swung five to six wide for home,
 dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong latching on the leader steadily wearing down that foe to just get the nod on the wire. GIANT
 ROCKS three wide just off the duel, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths joined outside by the aforementioned foe and advanced on the top pair,
 swung four then three wide for home straightened away, rallied to poke a head in front a furlong out, dug in under flanking challenges, shook off the former
 leader inside the sixteenth pole and lost the bob on the wire. BAREFOOT ANGEL dueled inside of POM FREIGHT from the get go coming under coaxing in
 tandem with that rival three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside for home shaking off his main pace rival and under threat from a new pair, dug in
 and was headed for command at the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages while just salvaging the show honors. THE I MAN coaxed from the gate,
 chased the pace along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside for home, rallied steadily gaining through the length of the
 stretch and just missed for the show honors. BIG AUK five wide down the backstretch, chased three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the
 seven-sixteenths, went six wide at the head of the stretch, kicked on belatedly. CLONEDSIMMARD chased two to three wide under coaxing from the half
 mile pole, swung three wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. WHAT A CULTURE veered in at the start, saved ground detached at the tail
 of the field, came under urging nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside at that station and made no impact. PIO'S POSSE six wide down the
 backstretch, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and took the overland route through the turn, cornered seven wide for home and made no impact.
 POM FREIGHT dueled from the two path with BAREFOOT ANGEL to his inside from the get go, came under coaxing as that rival did with three-eighths to
 go, spun three wide for home and was shaken off straightened away, then faltered in the stretch.
