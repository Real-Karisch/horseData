 OWNER'S SUITE sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the rail and drew off through the stretch under steady handling. MEET MICHELLE ,
 bumped by SNIPER SIS leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and rallied. PAUL'S PLUNDER circled the
 turn three wide, drifted to the four path in upper stretch, chased the winner and weakened. VICS COOL CAT chased the pace two wide around the turn and
 weakened late. ROCKIN ANNA ROLLIN broke sluggishly, raced three wide turning for home and failed to be a menace. PROMISES FOREVER stumbled
 leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. SNIPER SIS bumped MEET MICHELLE when bearing out leaving the
 starting gate, raced two wide on the turn and was outrun. AWESOME BUTTERFLY , always wide, weakened. DOWN WITH BROWN hugged the inner rail
 on the turn and faltered. INDEHERE trailed.

 Footnotes
 LAST CHUKKER rated close up off the duel, gained three wide under some rating past the five sixteenths, drifted in to be just off the heels of the winner in
 upper stretch, altered in, bid a sixteenth out, gained command in deep stretch and prevailed under a steady drive. SUBDUED dueled outside a rival, shook
 clear in upper stretch, remained clear under left handed rousing past mid stretch, met the inside bid of the winner and kept on gamely. ALADDIN SANE
 stalked inside, angled four wide into the stretch, attempted to lay in a bit leaving mid stretch, switched over to his correct lead near the sixteenth marker,
 straightened and closed willingly. C M RUNAWAY settled off the pace, advanced inside mid turn, swung out five wide past the five sixteenths and churned
 on. TO BE OR NOT TO BE dueled inside for nearly six furlongs and faded. OFFERHECANTREFUSE was pinched back at the break, lagged off the pace
 and failed to menace. PAUL THE WAITER stalked three to four wide outside a rival, was under pressure nearing the lane and faded. EASTPORT moved up
 behind rivals leaving the three quarter pole, checked a couple of times past the five eighths when tough to settle, angled five wide, circled giving chase then
 weakened in the drive.

 Footnotes
 COME ON CALLIE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace, opened a clear lead near the eighth pole and held sway under brisk urging. CHICKEN DINNER
 , three wide around the turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch then dueled outside the winner in a game effort. ALPHABETTING stalked the pace around
 the turn and rallied along the rail. PRISS lacked speed, circled the turn four or five wide, drifted to the six path in upper stretch and closed outside horses.
 LADY ROZINA , four wide on the turn, was well positioned entering the stretch and flattened out. CONQUESTHARDCHERRY disputed the pace in the two
 path between horses and gave way. DIXIE DO GOOD saved ground around the turn and failed to rally. TRADING CENTS was outrun. IT'S A DOOZY , no
 factor, was in the five path turning for home.

 Footnotes
 CASE DISMISSED saved ground, moved up past mid stretch, angled out, closed determinedly under pressure and forged ahead very late. FENDER BABY
 dueled inside, shook clear near mid stretch, widened a bit near the sixteenth marker, kept on gamely but just failed to contain the winner. COCKTAIL
 WAITRESS dueled outside FENDER BABY to upper stretch and faded late. ROSY'S RAINBOW saved ground chasing the pace, angled three wide into the
 lane, had aim but flattened out. UNIQUE HUMOR , three to four wide, failed to threaten. WEE MONIE CREEK broke slowly, hustled up, advanced four to
 five wide mid turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way. BEARSATLANTICMIST rushed up early, pursued off the rail and weakened. MISS
 RADAR was outrun. POLARIZATION , off the pace, raced five wide in upper stretch and failed to respond. PRETTY SURPRISE failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 DISTILLED SPIRIT opened up mid way on the turn, set the pace along the rail and lasted under vigorous rousing. MAKE US SMILE , two wide around the
 turn, chased the winner and gamely gained late. TOP HAT TREASON saved ground around the turn, angled outside near the eighth pole and failed to
 menace in an even effort. FOURTEEN CARROT , near the rail around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally. PIGGYBANK ,
 reluctant to load into the starting gate, broke slowly, lacked speed and passed tired horses. TOTAL ACCESS , three deep on the turn, was outrun. MANLEY
 CROSS , along the inner rail on the turn, was not a factor. CAN DO TOO , steadied behind several horses mid way down the backstretch, circled the turn
 three wide and lacked a rally. TWO DOORS DOWN flipped in the paddock, failed to be a factor and raced in the two path on the turn. MARYLAND
 BADBOY dropped back.

 Footnotes
 MIDNIGHT CROSSING prompted the pace outside CROSSINGTHEVALLEY, drew alongside that one leaving the far turn, gained a short lead mid turn,
 dueled to the wire and held sway under a repeated right handed drive. CROSSINGTHEVALLEY grabbed command soon after the break, set the pace
 towards the rail, was joined leaving the far turn, went head to head from the three eighths to deep stretch, kept on gamely but just wasn't quite good enough.
 WEEKEND FLYER stalked the dueling leaders three wide, saw that pair get away a bit nearing mid stretch but dug down and found a bit more to bridge the
 gap. SWEET DANCER saved ground in an even effort. HOLY FREEDOM saved ground and offered a mild response. PERFECT PARTY GIRL drafted back
 off the pace while inside, swung five wide approaching the stretch but lacked a bid. MAJORIE MUGS , off slow when hopping a bit, lagged off the pace,
 came very wide for the drive and failed to recover. KIM'S PET broke poorly, rushed up between rivals, steadied leaving the five eighths, made a mild three
 wide move mid turn, failed to kick on past the quarter pole and weakened. NEETEE RIDES AGAIN , sluggish from the start, raced well off the rail and was
 outrun.

 Footnotes
 THURMAN MERMAN cleared early without much effort, set a rated pace towards the inside, responded when set down in upper stretch and held sway
 under a drive. BIRDIES HONOR , three deep nearing the half mile marker, gave hard chase around the turn and through the lane and finished a game
 second. TEAM TIM broke a step slow, saved ground off the pace, swung out very wide past the three sixteenths, straightened and finished willingly to nab
 the show. CASH EXCHANGE , three wide early, shifted five wide into the lane and had some late interest between rivals. SUPER BUDDY lacked speed
 then had belated interest inside rivals. HERE'S A JETPACK , fractious behind the gate, broke a step slow, saved ground nearing the half, angled four wide
 making some headway approaching the stretch, chased past mid stretch then hung late between foes. PAPACHO was hustled early while saving ground,
 pursued to mid stretch and faded. CANDY ASSET was outrun. DANCETRACK , between runners nearing the half mile marker, stayed willingly to about the
 quarter pole then faltered.
