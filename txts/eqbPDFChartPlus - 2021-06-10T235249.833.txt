 Footnotes
 MISS RICKLES set the pace just off the rail, turned back a bid through the second turn, shook clear in the lane, then drew off and was kept to the task.
 PATRIOT LADY stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to challenge through the second turn, then could not match strides with the winner and held the
 place safe. DANCE FOR JOE well placed, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed
 the place. SHAKESPERIAN DREAM improved her position. MISTRETTA never far back, looped four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest
 into the lane and weakened in the drive. LIVE LIKE JAY well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
 stretch and had no rally.

 MICHAZL JOHN tracked the pace, angled out to bid outside of that one into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off the final furlong. TARTAN THE BULL
 sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then could threaten the winner in the lane, while clearly best of the
 rest. LEADING STORM allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and closed well for the show.
 AMERICAN ROCK SALT ran evenly. AAAANDEEE well placed and outside, lost some ground through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and faded
 further. OUR GOLDEN LAD was no factor. CRYPTO'S PICK showed little.

 TWO TIMES BOOK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid through the turn, shook clear into the lane, then drew off and was kept to
 the task. CATACLYSMIC well placed and inside, angled out into the turn, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid outside the leader into
 the stretch, then was no match for that one and held the place safe. JUSTONEMOREPATRON bobbled at the start, looped up four wide through the turn,
 bid on that path into the lane, dueled with B E BOSTON STRONG and edged ahead of that one for the show. B E BOSTON STRONG never far back,
 looped to a striking position five wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, dueled, weakened late and held a share. SWIFT ONE allowed to settle,
 looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch, angled in and missed a share. AWESOME HEART mid pack, gained position
 on the two path through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and could not gain. NEW YORK'S ZIP allowed to settle,looped to position six wide
 through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and had no rally. SOUTHBEACHSANDY was a brief factor.

 FIRST IN CLASS tracked the pace, angled out through the turn to bid three wide outside the leader, then made a steady gain and drew off the final furlong.
 DRY MARTINI mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then was
 no match for the winner and held the place. ARTUS COURT allowed to settle, looped five and six wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch,
 made a steady gain and edged up for the show. DARING DESTINY vied for the early lead on the outside, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
 weakened the final furlong and held a share. I'M NOT FUNNY mid pack, looped up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and
 evened out. MR. ROCK SALT set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged, then faded the final furlong. CANDY CRUZIN well placed and outside,
 angled in while holding position through the turn, then had no stretch rally. AUSTIN'S XCHANGER was no factor, inside. PINO MAMMONE was pulled up
