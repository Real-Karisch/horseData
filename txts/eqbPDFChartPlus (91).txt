 a mild bid in upper stretch then was outfinished for second. BEAUTIFUL NITE SKY inside, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch bumping CAROLYN,

 LUCKY GIRASOL with the second flight along the inside into the turn, angled out to the four path, closed determinedly four wide through the stretch and got
 up in the final strides. ROLLIN ALL THE WAY prompted the pace two wide into the turn, inherited the lead, shook clear off the trail in the three wide in upper
 stretch, dug in determinedly through the final sixteenth and just missed hanging on. PULPIT'S PURRFECT offered a mild bid three wide on the turn then
 was outfinished. HOLYWOOD HUMOR with the second flight three wide, drifted to the six path entering the stretch then finished evenly. BABY NINA offered
 a mild bid along the inside entering the stretch then came up empty. LA PAROTA stumbled badly at the start, swung wide and was no threat. BAYTOWN
 LINDY broke inward then was no factor. LILBITABOVENORMAL set the early pace then stopped on the turn.

 RAPID ROUGE dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, inherited the lead then finished full of run through the final furlong to win as much the best.
 BOSS MAN BOB allowed to settle, rallied determinedly late in the eight path and finished clearly second best. ONE WAY TO FAME prompted the pace
 between horses three wide into the turn then faded. E Z MOON vied for the lead six wide and weakened in the stretch. THE HERO WITHIN was a forward
 factor five wide down the backstretch and retreated om the turn. FOREVER KRZ was no factor. POLITICAL JUSTICE pressed the pace four wide down the
 backstretch and was through early. BATTERED was no factor. MAJOR DRAMA dueled for the lead along the rail into the stretch, suffered a catastrophic
 injury to his left front leg, pulled up and was euthanized. EDGING dropped his head to the dirt as the gate opened unseating his rider. THE STEWARDS

 Footnotes
 LOOKS LIKE SIMON sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace and drew away late under right handed urging.
 WE WILL SHINE chased gthe winner all the way and finished second best along the inside. GRANDSON SLAM passed tiring rivals. SIN PROBLEMA failed
 to menace. INTERNATIONAL MAN had speed into the stretch then faded in the four path. WHISTLIN' JACK missed the break then passed tiring rivals
 inside. DIAMOND MONARCH was no threat. KID TEJANO was outrun. TIGER TAIL had speed in the three path into the turn then gave way.
 ITWILLBEALRIGHT was through early.
