 DERBY MEMORIES established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside through moderate splits, widened away through the far turn coming
 under coaxing past the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, went clear under a drive getting geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish,
 the outcome in no doubt. OSO NEGRO broke in at the start bumping CLONEDSIMMARD into UMMU UMMU UMMU, raced four then three wide through
 the first turn to the outside of CLONEDSIMMARD, settled three then two wide at the tail of the field through the opening half mile, came under coaxing into
 the far turn, steadily advanced past backing away rivals and went five wide into upper stretch, improved position for the place honors while never
 threatening the winner. LEGION STORM settled two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the nine-sixteenths, tipped four
 wide through the far turn, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch offering up a mild bid, then weakened in the stretch while clear for the show honors.
 FRENCH REVOLUTION hustled from the gate, came under an off sided stick into the first turn racing three wide, chased three wide in range of the leader,
 came under coaxing at the three-eighths as that rival gave him the slip, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. DREAMMASTER bobbled after
 the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the nine-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and tired. ARGUTO coaxed along chasing along the
 inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. UMMU UMMU UMMU bumped at the start by CLONEDSIMMARD due to pressure from OSO
 NEGRO, raced forwardly placed just off the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and folded.
 CLONEDSIMMARD got bumped at the start OSO NEGRO and in turn bumped UMMU UMMU UMMU, raced three wide through the opening bend near the
 rear of the field, continued three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, went four wide into upper
 stretch and made no impact.

 Footnotes
 DADDY KNOWS brushed the inside of the gate then was hustled from the start, raced in the four path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside while
 under a snug hold, was asked leaving the backstretch, made a bid in the three path on the far turn, took over into upper stretch, kicked clear into the final
 furlong and drew away under steady urging. OVERLAND was hustled from the gate, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came
 under urging near the seven-sixteenths, chased in the four path on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch, chased under the whip in the drive and
 narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. CRAZY LIFE was rated while inside to the two path on the first turn then wrestled further off the
 pace early on the backstretch, raced between horses under stout restraint, moved closer again with a half-mile to run, drafted two to three wide on the far
 turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, pursued the winner into the final furlong and also proved no match then just missed the place while able to get the
 show. MAKE MOTIME was last to commence, went three then two wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, tugged his way closer outside the
 half-mile pole, saved ground on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. DANFUSI broke very fast and established
 early control, set the pace in the two path while in hand, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way. THE HAPPY
 GIANT went three to four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, raced three wide on the far turn, came four
 wide into the stretch and failed to respond. CURLIN'S LEGACY moved in entering the first turn, saved ground on that bend, settled at the rear under some
 urging, raced inside on the far turn and failed to threaten.

 Footnotes
 CONQUEST HARDCANDY assumed a forward position after the field had been sent on its way, was patiently ridden stalking the pacesetter from the two
 path, inched up and took over right after three-quarters had been rattled off, turned for home with a revved-up trio a short distance behind in hot pursuit,
 arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and got turned loose, kicked free, enough so as to begin the final furlong holding her largest lead, dug in with good
 determination late to stay in the clear. DREAM PASSAGE sighted pulling during the initial stages, was mostly three wide in pursuit of the front runners, got
 put to a drive spinning into the lane, chiseled away at the deficit, fell short but won the fight with COMPLICIT for place honors. COMPLICIT off the inside
 throughout, tipped into the four path during the run around the far turn, got set down coming up to the quarter pole, closed in mildly in tandem with the
 second place finsiher, came up short for second. FERDINANDA three wide on the second bend, commenced the stretch angling slightly wider into it, by now
 having been set down, lacked the needed response. PAUSEFORTHECAUSE saved ground for the opening six furlongs, got put to a ride getting sent to the
 outisde springing from the five-sixteenths marker, wound up in the two path at the head of the stretch, made no impact. TANYA'S GEM established control
 shortly after the start, got guided over to the rail, threw down the first two fractions on a loosely-contested lead, came under pressure from the eventual
 winner during the setting of the next one, got headed a wee bit beyond the five-sixteenths marker, ventured onward for another furlong before appearing to
 have little left, backed away readily thereafter.

 Footnotes
 BIG MUDDY six paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tucked three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the
 seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside a quintet stacked across track inside the final eighth, was among a quartet latched on
 through the final sixteenth and got up in the last jumps to prevail. ORPHEUS (ARG) got bumped by NOLINSKI and in turn bumped LORD SIMBA, raced
 four paths off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked to the two path placed to coaxing at the half mile pole, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied
 willingly among rivals through the final furlong racing between foes late and was up for the place honors on the wire. DAZZLING OKIE coaxed in pursuit
 along the inside, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, angled in with three-sixteenths to go and rallied up the rail to issue a challenge inside the final
 furlong into contention a sixteenth from home, ran on willingly to just get up in a blanket finish for the show honors. SOUL P SAY bobbled slightly at the
 start, came under coaxing to establish command shortly after the break and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from KAHRAMANI to
 the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, got shown the stick to the off side through the latter portion of the turn with five-sixteenths to go, swung
 three wide into upper stretch, inched away to the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a host and then a trio and was caught by all three in the final strides
 to the finish. GORELLI just off the pace two to three wide, tucked inside placed to light coaxing half a mile from home, swung four wide into upper stretch,
 dug in under a drive but weakened in the late stages. NOLINSKI stumbled at the start and broke on top despite it recovering outwards and bumping
 ORPHEUS into LORD SIMBA, chased four to five wide from just off the pace, tucked three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
 angled five wide for home, dug in under a drive losing a seam between ORPHEUS and BIG MUDDY nearing the eighth pole, altered to the inside of
 KAHRAMANI and weakened in the late going. KAHRAMANI stumbled at the start, recovered to press the pace of SOUL P SAY from the outside three then
 two wide under a ride with three furlongs remaining, spun five wide into upper stretch, got shaken off nearing the eighth pole, dug in and weakened in the
 final furlong. RIVER OF DREAMS chased three then two wide from near the rear under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled six to seven wide into upper
 stretch, offered no response. LORD SIMBA bumped after the start by ORPHEUS due to pressure from NOLINSKI, chased five then four wide under coaxing
 from the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and weakened.

 Footnotes
 VAST showed good speed and disputed the pace, vied near the rail on the turn, responded well when put to the whip in upper stretch, came out near the
 furlong marker and made light contact with an opponent then was corrected by the rider, shook off two foes into the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed
 under strong urging. GOOD SHABBOS broke in and brushed the gate, showed speed on the inside of the winner, dropped back off the pace near the
 half-mile pole, started the turn in the two path, angled four then five wide later on that bend, advanced outside to make a bid into the final furlong, kept on
 well to the wire but missed while just able to get the place. PURE WOW bumped with a rival at the start, showed good speed and disputed the pace on the
 outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, was carried out some by the winner at the eighth-pole, fought on well in the final furlong and just missed
 the place while clear for the show. LOTTA OTT was urged along off the pace, chased in the four to five path on the turn, pursued the vanguard under a drive
 into the final furlong and was out-kicked. BIRD TYCOON broke a half-step slow then dropped back under urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn,
 came three wide into the stretch then was put to the whip, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. DROP A HINT broke a step slow then
 was hustled, dropped back while climbing greenly into the kickback early, moved out while urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, swung five
 wide into upper stretch then moved out a bit more and lacked the needed response. APURATE broke in and a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace,
 moved out near the half-mile pole, chased in the three to four path on the turn, dropped inward in upper stretch and tired. MYLASTFIRSTKISS stumbled
 badly at the start while bumping with a rival and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, was urged near the back on the outside, went five then six
 wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

 Footnotes
 FELIX IN FABULA away in good order, prompted the pace from path two, increased his presence as three-quarters was being completed, was turned loose
 stepping into the lane, emerged as the clear leader by the start of the final furlong, held on well to stave off its stablemate. CURLIN ROAD was taken hold of
 after coming out with his initial step, sat reserved in midpack, positioned in path two and from between rivals on the far turn, got angled three wide into the
 stretch, narrowed in, came out after some left side stick work at the furlong grounds, inducing SUPER DUDE, in the general area at the time, to move wider
 too, kept a truer course afterwards, failed to make any headway thereafter and had to settle for the place. AMERICAN LINCOLN remained forwardly placed
 after the break, slid over to the rail with the advantage early on the clubhouse bend, showed the way, accompanied by the winner from the outside, saw that
 one crank up the pressure coming up to midpoint on turn two, was set down for the drive home, gave up the lead for good by the furlong grounds, hung out
 prominently placed for a little whiile before weakening. SUPER DUDE underwent a three wide pursuit, got set down in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole,
 was abreast of the second place fnisher as that foe wandered for a few jumps towards the middle of the strip in midlane, shied out wider himself, lacked a
 solid closing punch. HARV WON'T TAP quickly spotted in the two path after the start, stayed there until the end of the far turn, was moved out into path six
 down the lane, made no impact. HEAVY ROLLER rated in the pocket, faltered. HOLIDAY BONUS saved ground while trailing throughout.

 Footnotes
 MR HAVERCAMP away without apparent mishap, sat within strikng distance in the three path on each bend, crept up as three-quarters was being
 completed, got set down stepping onto the head of the stretch, challenged in earnest a sixteenth down the road, grabbed away the advantage, finished with
 good determination to preserve the decision. HEMBREE took up position in the two path after the field had been released, got let out a notch after departing
 the backstretch, got asked for more being maneuvered to the outside for the drive, eventually being fanned out into the six path to become the widest of all,
 closed in with good energy down the center of the course to garner the place. QURBAAN tracked the front runners towards the inside route, was switched
 over to a light hand ride by the three-eighths pole to keep interest, got sent outward after entering the stretch, settling in right around path five, came home
 willingly to secure the show. MADE YOU LOOK pursued the pace from the two path, going about it from between rivals for much of the journey leading up to
 the half mile pole, moved out four wide during the early stages of the stretch run, made no headway in the last eighth. MARCH TO THE ARCH sat reserved
 in the two path, tipped a bit during the stretch run, split rivals late narrowing in, just missed out on the last major check. DOCTOR MOUNTY unhurried taking
 the two path, got sent into path five during the initial portion of the stretch, rallied midly but without impact. OFFERING PLAN pinched at the start, took the
 inside route for until the end of the bend, failed to fire after getting spotted in the two path. VOODOO SONG stalked the pace from path two, got roused
 spinning onto the top of the lane, faltered. GIDU (IRE) off to a sharp beginning, kicked away to an open lead, was coaxed along carving out the pace from
 along the inside route, shadowed by VOODOO SONG from the outside, felt an uptick in pressurre as the third fraction was being finalized, gave in at the
 furlong grounds, then steadily backed away. FIRST PREMIO got set up in the pocket in short order, was kept in reserve for nearly six furlongs cut the corner
 into the lane, idled behind VOODOO SONG, having some clearance along the rail corridor, but not of the optimal sort, attempted to tip to the outside of the
 aforementioned rival coming up to the sixteenth marker, only to have that opponent drift a bit wider too, becoming once again directly in front, faded away
 the rest of the trip to the wire, lightly ridden out.
