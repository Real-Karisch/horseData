 Footnotes
 MASON B sent for the lead from the outside, cleared foes and angled across to the inside, led through the turn and drew away under right-handed urging.
 FOUR GAELS chased from the inside, bumped with rival early, followed the leader from the two path to the stretch, lacked the needed late punch and held
 the place. JUSTONETIMEBABY traveled mid-pack and angled in on the backstretch, angled out leaving the turn but quickly came back to the inside at the
 top of the lane and was along for the show. BOUND FOR HEAVEN bumped leaving the gate, bumped again and steadied early, chased three wide and
 outside a rival to the stretch and weakened. SNOWMASS VILLAGE bumped at the start, raced near the back of the field, took the turn two wide and was
 never a factor. GOLDEN ATLANTIC bumped both sides at the start, took the turn three wide and never rallied. WARREN'S COLE fractious in the gate, off
 slow slow to begin, traveled a bit off the rail, angled out and never threatened.

 Footnotes
 GETIN GREADY dueled from the outside, cleared around the turn widened the advantage through the final furlong. NICKY'S SPOT dueled from the inside,
 failed to match strides with the leader around the turn and bested the rest. EXOTIC OVATION chased off the rail, bumped and forced out nearing the eighth
 pole, lugged in and bumped rival and finished evenly. SHE'S GONE WESTERN off slow at the start, reserved up the backstretch, advanced nearing the
 turn, angled out on the turn then swung out even further around troubled rivals and finished willingly in the final furlong. WHERES HOLLYWOOD stalked
 from the inside, lacked room off the heels of NICKY'S SPOT and checked, veered out leaving the turn and bumped rival, bumped again in the stretch and
 weakened. AUTISMONEFORTYFIVE settled early, angled out on the turn, knocked into rival entering the stretch and was not percevered with after. GO
 NELI GO saved ground around the turn and proved no menace. The Stewards disqualified WHERES HOLLYWOOD from fifth to sixth for veering out and
 causing interference to AUTISMONEFORTYFIVE leaving the turn.
