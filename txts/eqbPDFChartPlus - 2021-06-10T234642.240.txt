 Footnotes
 HUSTLE UP got away alertly, chased the pacesetter outside, moved three wide to take the lead willingly at the five-sixteenths, drew off while geared down
 late. HANKY PANKY KIM shifted out clearing the gap, attended just off the pace, contended between foes on the turn, was no match for the winner but
 second best. STEALING HOME was coaxed clear in the early stages having came off the inside to set the early pace, continued vying inside foes, yielded
 at the head of the lane. SANTITA S S settled off the pace, came into the stretch four wide and improved position. SOME ASSEMBLY REQD pursued the
 leading trio outside a foe, drifted a bit greenly in the lane. THE WHUPS failed to menace. GATLING GOLD raced inside and failed to rally. MIDNIGHT
 LOVER was forced in a bit after the break, saved ground through the turn and came up empty. SHOWTIME EXPRESS was in a bit tight after the break and
 raced well back. DRIVE THRU GARY reared at the break losing the rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS
 TAKEN. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, FIRST FRACTIONAL SPLIT UNAVAILABLE.

 CANT HIDE MY CRAZY stalked the leading pair having shifted in a bit, went mostly three to four wide on the turn, took aim in upper stretch and drove clear.
 KISSHERGOODBY was in tight at the break, steadied on heels having rushed up behind the leading pair near the half-mile marker, shifted in to save
 ground on the turn, came out in the stretch, got up for second. BEAN TOWN BABE broke outwardly, prompted the pace from outside, pressed before taking
 over a narrow lead in upper stretch, weakened and lost the place late. WAYTOGOHOME settled outside, came into the stretch four to five wide and gained
 mildly while just missing a placing. FLAXY LADY contended inside but off the rail, yielded. IRISH QUEEN lacked room and steadied in behind runners as
 KISSHERGOODBY shifted out in the stretch, altered out late. DOMINATING was bumped lightly at the break and showed little thereafter.
