 MOONOVERTHENILE was bumped at the start, led throughout and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under a brisk hand ride.
 CASCABRIA unhurried early, closed determinedly along the rail through the stretch and finished clearly second best. SOPHIE'S PRIZE chased the winner
 from the inside for three furlong, shifted out to the five path then faded. R LAGUNA LUCKY was a forward factor in the four path into the stretch then
 weakened. YOLY LUCKEY failed to menace. TRUE BLUE DIAMOND was no factor. SHARI'S TIME had brief speed. LIZZY SCORE was no threat. COURT
 HOUSE KITTY bore out at the start bumping the winner then was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 OURAY always within striking distance, dug in determinedly through deep stretch in the four path and got up in the final strides. KING OF BLING pressed
 the pace from the three path for a half, made the lead, shook clear in upper stretch and just missed hanging on. ORIGAMI DOWNTOWN never far back,
 loomed boldly five wide after a half then finished with good courage. ROLLIN WAY OVER offered a mild bid in the two path entering the stretch then leveled
 off. MAGNA MAN found his best stride late in the six path. BABY BLING was no threat. HORSERADISH was outrun. MIDNIGHT XPRESS was forced
 inward entering the clubhouse turn, slipped through rapidly to make the lead along the rail before a quarter, set the pace for a half, had speed for six
 furlongs then folded. MINI BIRD stalked the pace from the four path and was through after a half.

 Footnotes
 NEUK unhurried while settling in the two path for six and one half furlongs, shifted out to the six path, closed with a rush late and got up in the final strides.
 SHAWKLIT MILKSHAKE broke in front, set all the pace, widened into the stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. VIGILANTE LAW slow
 early, found his best stride late in the four path. WIL LIKES LUCKY inside, went evenly. AVGOLEMONO was no threat. JAVA FOR TWO had brief speed
 then faded. GIANNI DRAMA was fractious in the gate, moved up in the four path on the backstretch, had speed into the stretch then came up empty.
 REDRITEEIGHTYEIGHT chased the leader into the second turn then gave way. RIVERY HALL was never involved. LATE DOUBLE JACK also fractious in
 the gate, was bumped at the start then always outrun. TUSCAN MIST also outrun, stopped on the far turn and jogged to the wire. HAVANA MIKE was
 through after half, also stopped and jogged to the wire.
