 SUMMERLAND away alertly and raced to the lead while keeping one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, dictated the pace while staying two
 wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and finished determinedly three wide in the drive to hold off DANCIN SHOES to prove best.
 DANCIN SHOES broke sharply and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue three wide in the run
 down the backstretch and into the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to prove easily second best. FRIDAY settled off the early pace while
 saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to save ground through the second turn and gained a stalking trip behind the top pair
 entering the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on the leaders through the final turn, but finished from along the rail in the drive to hold on for a share.
 GIFTED GREY settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, gained ground through the second turn
 to hold a stalking position at the back of a compact field entering the backstretch, began to lose touch with the top pair approaching the final turn, but
 finished willingly two wide in the drive.

 for the place in the closing strides. SHARP CONTRAST broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, was
 unable to keep pace with the winner entering the final turn, but battled determinedly two wide in the drive to just miss the place. BEAR stalked the leaders
 into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. DORYS
 DARLIN away well and settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but was

 HEARTSET raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace through the stretch the first time, dictated the
 pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, maintained a clear advantage into the lane, and was all out to hold off a late charge by
 SANAWAR to prevail. SANAWAR tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside entering
 the final turn, and closed with a rush from along the rail in deep stretch to just miss. ROYAL BRIAR unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied
 smartly four wide entering the final turn, and closed steadily four wide in the drive. MAGGIE'S GUY tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time
 while hung five wide, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive. KERMODE stalked the early pace while racing
 one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive while
 unable to make a late impact. CHILCOTIN HILL tracked the leader four wide through the stretch the first time, was asked to keep up midway down the
 backstretch, but was through before reaching the final turn. OMEGA VICTORY pressed the pace while racing two out from the rail through the stretch the
 first time, assumed a tracking trip two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but faded over the final
 furlong.
