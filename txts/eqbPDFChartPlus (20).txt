 Footnotes
 FASTER THAN CHROME quickly took control of a sharp break and tapered to the inside to rate the pace, was asked for run leaving the turn and proved
 much the best with steady stretch handling. After stumbling from the gate, STERLING CAESAR picked up the chase off the rail, raced in range of the lead
 rounding the turn but proved no match through the lane and settled for second. COUSIN MO picked up the chase into the backstretch after steadying on the
 chute, rounded the turn off the rail, drifted into the lane and finished evenly. OLE BUDDY MIKEY chased the pace from the four path, drifted leaving the turn
 and showed little further. ACCESS TO DENIS chased the pace toward mid track, rounded the turn in the six path and had little left through the lane. MY
 NAME'S FAMOUS came away awkwardly then picked up the early chase from the outside, angled toward the rail nearing the turn then weakened down the
 lane. THRILL OF THE HUNT chased the pace from the outside, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little further in the stretch. GETAWAY
 PLAN came away a step slow then ducked in leaving the chute, settled well back off the rail, bid past the five sixteenths pole and finished better than he
 started.

 SWEET LADY SUE hustled up to set a pressured pace on the outside, rounded the turn in the three path, then drove down the lane under steady handling
 and drifted out in the final sixteenth. FINLEY'S FORTUNE gave chase two wide between horses and took the turn in the three path, then raced down the
 lane and was slowly closing on the winner. DUZIBATZ gave chase inside and rounded the turn on the rail, then lost ground coming into the lane widest and
 drifted out late in the lane. DIAMOND CAUSEWAY pressured the pace on the inside and rounded the turn on the rail, then dropped back past the quarter
 pole and faded. CLOWN QUESTION broke a step slow then chased the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the five path, then leveled off in the
 stretch. POLISHED ACCOUNT fell to the back, trailing early, and was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 After coming away a bit awkwardly, HIGH DREAMER picked up the chase about the four path, angled toward the rail approaching the turn, came inside
 Shamrock Green leaving the eighth pole, dueled to the lead mid-stretch and inched clear through later yards. AROOSTOOK angled in leaving the chute to
 pressure Shamrock Green at mostly even terms through the backstretch, drifted out leaving the turn, dueled to recover even terms past the eighth pole but
 was outfinished for the win while besting the early pace-setter for second. SHAMROCK GREEN set a pressured pace at mostly even terms through the
 backstretch, inched ahead of Aroostook through the turn, was met again at even terms past the eighth pole then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
 WINDSOR LEGEND eased to the three path to give chase through the backstretch, was carried six wide leaving the turn and raced evenly down the lane.
 ME VOY came out at the break to exchange contact with Candy For Sharon and was shut off on the chute, picked up the chase toward mid track, rounded
 the turn in the three path and finished well. DOMINIC THE QUICK chased the pace toward the outside, rounded the turn in the five path but proved empty
 down the lane. EARLY BOP angled toward mid track to give chase, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little down the lane. CANDY FOR SHARON
 exchanged contact with Me Voy leaving the gate and raced wide. The stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Aroostook, lodged by the rider of
 Me Voy, and disqualified the former to fifth place for coming across the path of the latter on the chute.

 Footnotes
 FORINT'S CASTLE broke in to make contact with Sallie Get Up then rated with the pace two deep, took the lead nearing the end of the first turn, was
 pressured past the three eighths pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn and held on well under steady encouragement. FIFTY NAYS FOR HAY came out
 at the break to make contact with Sallie Get Up then raced off the pace inside through the front stretch, was boxed in through the opening turn, started a bid
 approaching the seven sixteenths pole, steadied at the rail into the far turn, eased out a furlong away and finished well at the outside flank of the winner.
 CHARITABLE HEART came away awkwardly and out and settled off the pace about the five path the opening turn, closed toward contention leaving the
 half mile pole, challenged at the three eighths, raced in range of the lead three wide on the far turn then flattened stride in later yards. GALLANT CALLING
 rated close in the three path, took aim past the seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn just off the rail then weakened down the lane. DEMAY'S CASTLE
 rated close off the rail, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, eased out at the eighth pole and finished evenly. TAPIT'S
 NINIETTA, off the pace in the two and three paths, eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide then
 flattened stride in the stretch. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE, briefly clear, rated a short lead inside, was headed approaching the half mile pole, dropped back past
 the pole then faded nearing the far turn. SALLIE GET UP, jostled at the start, saved ground then showed little response through the backstretch.
 CLEARBROOK MISS rounded the first turn about the four path and showed little response.

 Footnotes
 CORY'S CUTIE stalked the pace on the inside and took over near the three-eighths pole, rounded the turn in the three path, then drove down the lane and
 under steady handling and held on. ZENARINA, saving ground into the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside, made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths
 pole and eased out to round the turn in the four path, then angled to the rail around the three-sixteenths pole and dug in down the lane nearest the rail to
 finish well. THAT TRICKY LADY saved ground going into the first turn and settled off the pace inside, eased out moving into the backstretch and made a bid
 approaching the three-eighths pole, took the far turn in the three path and moved to the outside leaving the turn, then dug in gamely but was outfinished.
 SMARTY PLEASE settled well back on the outside, made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole, steadily improved through the turn in the seven path and
 angled in past the three-sixteenths pole, then raced down the stretch on the inside and finished evenly. HANS ROAD settled off the pace outside, made a
 bid at the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the four path, then weakened in the stretch. DESPITE THE WIZARD settled well back and was
 never a factor. CITY TRAPPER broke a step slow then settled off the pace outside, made a mild bid approaching the five-sixteenths pole and dropped back
 through the turn in the four path, and showed little further. SOFATUDE battled to the front to rate the pace inside, was caught near the three-eighths pole,
 then faded through the turn. STRIKE EVEN was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 GABBI'S AMOR was hustled to contention along the rail and took the lead leaving the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear midway on the turn then dug in
 under steady encouragement to hold on well. ZEN PAPA bobbled, then stumbled after making contact with Song For Nicole, picked up the early chase
 toward the outside, raced in range of the lead three wide rounding the turn and dug in through the stretch to duel for second. PHILIPPIAN chased the pace
 toward the outside, raced in range of the lead while four wide on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. DAVID'S PRINCE set a pressured
 pace through the opening quarter mile then gave chase past the five sixteenths pole, dropped back midway on the turn, drifted into the lane and flattened
 stride inside the sixteenth pole. WESTERN HERITAGE chased the pace inside, rounded the turn at the rail and finished well. SONG FOR NICOLE, bumped
 at the break, picked up the chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the five path and showed little further. MARYLAND'S BEST gave early chase
 toward mid track, rounded the turn off the rail then weakened. CONTRACTOR JAK chased the leaders from mid track, rounded the turn in the four path then
 weakened in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 SCHLOSSER stalked the pace on the outside and moved to near even terms approaching the five-sixteenths pole, took over at that pole and drew clear
 without encouragement through the turn in the three path, then angled to the rail past the three-sixteenths pole and drove down the lane under occasional
 handling and held on. MEAN BEAN settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole and improved through the turn in the four
 path, then dug in gamely down the stretch but had to settle for second. FOLLOW THE NOTION was shuffled back at the start then settled well off the pace
 on the outside, made a bid approaching the five-sixteenths pole and steadily improved through the turn in the six path, then gained down the lane, passing
 rivals, to finish well. MORE DATA settled off the pace on the inside and made a bid past the five-sixteenths pole, rounded the turn on the rail, then eased out
 near the three-sixteenths pole to the three path and leveled off in the lane. BADUKE settled well off the pace on the inside, eased out leaving the first turn
 and made a bid past the three-eighths pole, took the far turn in the six path, then gained down the stretch and finished well. WILDCATPLEASURES settled
 off the pace on the outside, made a bid near the quarter pole in the five path, then finished evenly. SAINT IGNATIUS settled off the pace two wide between
 horses, made a mild middle move past the five-sixteenths pole, began the turn in the three path but moved out to the six path mid-turn, then weakened in
 the stretch. CUTTY SHARK was through early. CURVES THAT KICK rushed up and angled in to rate the pace inside, was met at near even terms
 approaching the five-sixteenths pole and was caught just a few strides later, then dropped back through the turn on the rail and faded in the lane. GURSKY
 saved ground into the first turn but was never a factor. Due to a timer malfunction, this race was hand-timed.

 Footnotes
 MYBIGSISTERCARRIE quickly took control to rate the pace inside, was pressured for run nearing the quarter pole, widened the advantage through the far
 turn and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. LADYS CROSS FIRST raced in the four path the opening turn, started a bid leaving the seven
 sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn five wide, took second a furlong away and finished well to be second best. HOPE'S CORK raced in the four path the
 first turn then settled toward the outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn six wide and was along for third
 later yards. LAND RUSH settled close in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then flattened stride the final furlong.
 THESLEEPYBEAUTY rated close inside the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened out down the lane.
 QUEENIE RULES angled toward the inside early on and was blocked through the opening turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path
 of the far turn and showed little further down the lane. BRING ON THE GREY saved ground off the pace then faded through the backstretch. NEVER
 CROSS A DIVA tapered in through the front stretch to stalk the pace two deep, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole then faded at the rail rounding the
 far turn. CHARITABLE GIRL rounded the first turn in the four path and was through early. HERSTORY rounded the first turn in the six path, settled outside
 into the backstretch and was not a factor.
