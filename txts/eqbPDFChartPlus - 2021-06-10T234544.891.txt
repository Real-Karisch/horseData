 Footnotes
 LAURA RAY was settled in hand near the inside in the opening half, saved ground while steadily gaining position inside foes on the far turn, shifted out
 three wide in upper stretch while being roused to challenge, then was floated out while advancing in close quarters between foes to gain a narrow edge in
 time, prevailing under firm handling. HONOR'S PARADE was settled in the last flight while switching outside a rival racing to the backstretch, swung four
 wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance, was carried wide in late stages but continued willingly to prevail for second while being just
 outkicked by the winner. ORDINARY LOVE sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, held sway on a clear margin into upper
 stretch, drifted out badly despite right handed pressure crossing into the path of SOARING NOW while also carrying out the top pair and yielded nearing the
 wire. SOARING NOW was rated just off the leaders along the inside in the opening half, advanced along the rail nearing upper stretch, shifted outside the
 pacesetter in upper stretch, then was carried out, squeezed, then bumped by that foe while being steadied out of tight quarters late. MOONLIGHT TRAIN
 tracked off the first flight in the opening stages, made brief progress three wide nearing the far turn but soon flattened out. MOON BLOSSOM bobbled at the
 break, settled along the inside in the last flight, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked a rally. KIKITOZ, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter
 racing to the far turn, emptied out nearing the lane. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF SOARING NOW LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST
 THE RIDER OF ORDINARY LOVE. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH AND DISQUALIFIED ORDINARY LOVE FOR
 INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER FOURTH.

 Footnotes
 PEACH TIME ducked outwards at the start making some contact with DOUBLE ESPRESSO (IRE), was quickly righted gaining terms with the first flight
 between foes attending the tempo under light reserve to the backstretch, was urged to gain the advantage while angling to the rail racing into the far turn,
 dictated terms to upper stretch while shifting off the inside, then continued with a grudging effort to withstand a challenge from SUPERSTAR BEA to prevail
 in an all out drive. The latter was rated just off the first flight under light reserve in the opening half, came around foes on the far turn advancing to striking
 position, shifted inside the leader to bid for command in late stages drawing on even terms with that foe but was just outfinished. HOUSEMAKER (GB)
 settled last racing to the far turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch while gathering momentum and was going well late. MERRI MESA was rated out of
 striking distance near the inside racing to the far turn, then split foes just off the inside in late stages to gain some position. CAUSE TO WONDER, reluctant
 to load in the starting gate, was off a step slowly, advanced to terms with the first flight four wide into the backstretch, moved to challenge the leader outside
 foes on the far turn and emptied out racing past midstretch. IS IT GOLD, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin to the
 backstretch and emptied out early. DOUBLE ESPRESSO (IRE), brushed by the eventual winner in the opening stages, was urged three deep to prompt the
 pace racing to the far turn and soon gave way.

 Footnotes
 J P ROCKER, urged to gain a forward placing outside a rival in the opening stages, continued with a steady bid to challenge the pacesetter nearing upper
 stretch, drifted out racing through the lane but prevailed late under brisk handling. BOSTON CHARLEY broke sharply, dictated the pace along the inside into
 the turn, resisted the winner's challenge past midstretch but yielded late. MISTER FUDGE tracked off the first flight between foes, altered out of tight
 quarters racing into the turn, then split rivals just off the inside to gain position along the inside late while prevailing for a share. HOTFOOT tracked off the
 second flight five, then four wide into the turn making steady progress and continued in that path to improve position to the end. GIANT GAMBLE tracked
 just off the second flight along the rail in the opening stages, was shuffled back when losing his path racing into the turn, then switched out in upper stretch
 to make some belated progress between foes. HARNERSBACH, urged along four wide, then three wide in pursuit of the top pair racing into the turn,
 continued in that path between foes but had no final kick. SOUL OF DISCRETION settled between foes off the second flight to the turn and offered no rally.
 IT'S MIKE'S TURN settled near the inside early and proved no threat. PARCHED settled outside foes racing to the turn and never gained contention.
 SOPHISTICATEDBLING was a brief factor between foes in second flight, angled to the rail nearing the turn impeding GIANT GAMBLE and soon faded.

 Footnotes
 LOOTN AND SHOOTN broke readily, tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance between foes racing into the turn, then made steady progress
 to wear down the pacesetter and prevail in time under firm handling. PERFECT MAJESTIC broke sharply, was sent clear racing into the turn while angling
 to the rail, held sway past midstretch but weakened in late stages while just failing to contain the winner. TWO STEPS BEFORE tracked the pacesetter
 inside foes, was getting out a bit while under some correction racing through the turn, then switched outside the top pair in late stages while moving to gain
 a share. PRAYINTHEPRAIRIE hopped at the start breaking last, advanced to contention racing four wide into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick.
 GREEK WEEK dropped out early. CURLIN'S KID, slow into stride, shifted out to race three wide between foes racing into the turn but had no late response
 and soon gave way.

 STARSHIP IMPULSE tracked the pacesetter four wide in the opening stages, made steady progress racing into the turn to challenge for command, took
 charge in upper stretch and went clear under some left handed pressure. DIVA OF DISASTER settled outside foes in the opening quarter, advanced four
 wide racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. WRAP IT UP broke outwards, was collected to track the pacesetter inside foes racing into the
 turn, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch but had no final kick. LASOEURCADETECHERI, shuffled back at the start, settled along the inside
 and made some mild progress inside foes late. MIA'S GUSTO was hustled to the lead while angling to the inside, dueled for command on the turn and gave
 way into upper stretch. UNBRIDLED MAYHEM broke inwards impeding a rival, was righted to track the pace between foes in second flight racing to the turn
 but emptied out nearing the lane. WONDER ABOUT LOLA broke awkwardly losing position at the start and failed to menace thereafter. ROSEBUD'S

 SAMURAI MIKE, held up along the inside tracking just off the leaders, was shuffled a bit avoiding a tiring foe racing into the turn, switched out to split rivals
 just off the inside in upper stretch and wrested the advantage to go clear under brisk handling. AIN'TSEENTHEBALL tracked off the first flight between,
 shifted out three wide racing into the turn making steady progress to gain the advantage racing into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. FINE
 CAT settled between foes in the last flight racing into the turn and improved his position in late stages. MIDNIGHT ZITHER, forwardly placed while angling
 inwards in the opening stages, was prompted to make a brief bid between foes racing into the turn but emptied out in upper stretch. LAMAR, urged to the
 lead while angling inside racing to the turn, emptied out early. TRIP BACK HOME broke slowly, raced four wide into the turn and lacked a rally.

 Footnotes
 PATH OF EXILE was urged to a forward placing along the inside prompting the pace, switched outside a rival racing into the turn while moving to challenge
 for command, took over racing into upper stretch and held the late bid of WAJNA SURPRISE under pressure. The latter tracked the pace outside foes in
 second flight racing into the turn and made steady progress three deep in late stages to close the gap on the winner. BOLD CHARMANT, urged to force the
 pace outside the eventual winner in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn to set the pace, couldn't contain the winner's bid, drifted out
 racing through the lane and came up empty. THE CHECOTAH KID tracked the pace between foes in second flight to the turn and couldn't produce a closing
 bid. ALVIN'S TOUCH settled last racing to the turn and failed to menace. MAGIC COWBOY tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, emptied out
 early, was outdistanced racing into the stretch but walked off the course under his own power.
