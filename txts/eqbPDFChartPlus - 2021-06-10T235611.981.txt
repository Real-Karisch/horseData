 Footnotes
 KARENINA settle well while rated off early pace positioned along outside, steadily moved up closer in the far turn then set down for drive, roused forward
 gaining the lead from PRAY PRAY PRAY, drifted out couple more paths under right handed encouragement and held clear. PRAY PRAY PRAY showed
 speed at the start, cleared and crossed in from outside position, held slight edge over keen running TIZ A LEGACY in early stages then gained clear lead
 after rival edged back, challenged for lead at head of lane, fought back but could not move on with eventual winner, came out under left handed drive, dug in
 to hold place. SARA'S DAY was unhurried settled off the pace in early stages, took closer in far turn, given cue top stretch, dug in along outside, could not
 get to eventual winner, just missed place. THANKS MOM was briefly fractious in the gate, secured inside position in the first turn then saved ground
 throughout the backstretch, cut the corner entering lane, moved up in close contention along rail then finished evenly just missing runner up spots. SHOW
 BIZ LIZ bumped slightly in first turn then raced in the back and saved ground, hustled up along inside at head of lane, showed response, came out few more
 paths and improved. TIZ A LEGACY hit the gate at the start then was bit keen and pulled way up to contest the pace, settled more and edged back to track
 the leader, made rebid leaving far turn but had no kick left in reserve. THREE QUESTIONS pulled wanting to go in the first turn then wanted to do more
 while taken off the pace, roused for more in far turn, failed to move on. TIKITACA broke out at the start, raced off the pace and lacked needed rally.
 BEAUTIFUL CHAOS raced in contention then faded in the far turn. BOZZINETA showed early response then quickly retreated after the half. Run up

 Footnotes
 JAI BLUE settled within striking range toward the inside, moved out getting in gear four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, rallied outside through the lane
 and drew clear late under a steady drive. MCMANAMAN chased in closest attendance to FIGHT ON FOREVER, bid three wide between horses through
 upper stretch and went clear for second in the late stages. TO JOE bumped with A B G DANI repeatedly at the start, raced four wide around the turn, and
 finished willingly outside to get the show near the wire. FIGHT ON FOREVER sprinted up for the lead inside, came off the turn in the two-path confronted by
 two challengers from the outside, and weakened through midstretch. A B G DANI was bounced around between U S SOLDIER and TO JOE for several
 strides after the start, steadied between horses just past the half-mile pole, came wide for the drive and finished with some interest. MR. G T had the
 three-path into the turn, lost position and moved inward cutting the corner turning for home, and had no late response. SALSA CAPUCHINO was three then
 two wide between rivals on the turn, and faded after a half-mile. U S SOLDIER bumped repeatedly with A B G DANI after the start, and was outrun.

 top two flights going through the backstretch, came under ride along outside entering the turn then raced two wide turning for home, produced solid run
 along outside in lane, could not get to clear leader while finishing far ahead of rest. MCFLY was unhurried racing near the back, shaken up five wide in the
 turn, continued outside bid into stretch, was no match for clear top pair but kept on and gained share. PILOTING stalked the top two early leaders positioned
 along outside of a rival, hustled up along outside in the turn then failed to make impact in the lane. FORCE vied for lead out of the chute then pressed pace
 racing outside of eventual winner, could not continue in touch with quick rival, came under a ride, had no late response. SKY CAPTAIN stalked top pair

 Footnotes
 AWESOMENDENSOME prompted the pace outside SHAKAKAN, challenged for command in the three-path turning for home, pulled clear past midstretch,
 then kept BISTRO MONCUR at a safe distance coming to the wire. BISTRO MONCUR checked after the start when LADY GREATNESS was pushed in
 toward her, trailed three wide for three furlongs, shifted further out and closed fast on the far outside through deep stretch. CORDELE was bumped between
 MAJESTIC MIST and IT'S EASY TO SAY heading into the turn and steadied back, came four wide into the lane and was going well late. LADY
 GREATNESS bumped with SHAKAKAN and was carried in by that rival at the start, was well back entering the stretch in the two-path, split THREAT and
 MAJESTIC MIST past the furlong grounds and finished with good energy. SHAKAKAN bumped with LADY GREATNESS and then veered in pushing the
 latter toward BISTRO MONCUR, went up to grab the lead off the inside, came two wide dueling with AWESOMENDENSOME through upper stretch, then
 weakened inside. THREAT raced two wide and was no factor. MAJESTIC MIST bumped with CORDELE and steadied early between foes, raced three then
 two wide in striking range on the turn and lacked a late punch. PRINCESS KNOLL raced four to five wide around the turn and could not get close. IT'S
 EASY TO SAY bumped with CORDELE from the four-path heading to the turn, moved in to be three wide on the turn and gave way. R SWEET EXCHANGE
 saved ground and dropped back through the stretch.

 LOST PRINCESS was taken back to race off pace in opening stages, continued unhurried and saving ground through the backstretch, pickled up the pace
 in the far turn then roused four wide at head of the lane, dug in along outside of ALERT KITTEN in deep stretch, cleared late. ALERT KITTEN secured
 inside position in the first turn, continued rated along inside in second flight, edged up closer and waited at the quarter pole then sent three wide turning for
 home, cleared the lead three wide approaching eighth pole then got outkicked by eventual winner in final stages. HERESURLAMAMAMA joined second
 flight after opening quarter, loomed up closer along outside at the quarter pole, set down for the drive, could not reach the lead but continued steady outside
 bid for share. HALO'S FOR DUDE was unhurried racing near the back, showed response between rivals at the three eighths pole, came under strong
 handling along outside in the lane, continued with interest. RETURN dueled along outside of CANDY BLU then between when HONEY HEARTS moved up
 along outside, battled through early stages and into upper stretch then gaveway in final furlong. HONEY HEARTS dueled along outside throughout early
 stages, continued battle turning for home then had nothing left in late reserve. BERNARDA raced off early pace then put to drive along outside top stretch,
 failed to move on. SOUTHERN DANCER was reserved racing in the back and lacked a rally in lane. DUQUESITA DE ALBA raced three wide in second
 flight and failed to sustain bid three furlongs out. CANDY BLU dueled for early lead then came up empty after the half mile marker. MS. SUMMATION
 retreated after half. Run up distance unavailable

 TALK LOGISTICS moved off the inside early, swept up four wide around the turn to join the leaders, grabbed the lead from RUPP with a quarter-mile to go,
 and was under a full-out drive to stay clear late. ACES FOR JOHN tracked the leaders inside leaving the backstretch, came three wide off the turn and
 finished with good courage outside to just catch RUPP for second. RUPP pressed the duelers from the outside, gained a brief lead three wide between calls
 on the turn, fought on after being overtaken by TALK LOGISTICS and weakened inside late to yield second money. CHARLIE THE GREEK raced three to
 four wide around the turn, and did not enter serious contention. JAIDEN'S BEST dueled for the early lead outside SIR HANNOUN, and gave way late on the
 turn. SIR HANNOUN went head and head inside JAIDEN'S BEST up the backstretch, then dropped back steadily around the turn.

 LIBERTY KITTEN settled in good spot racing two wide off top pair, moved up closer in the far turn then looked for spot top stretch, shifted out five then set
 down driving right handed, dug in gamely and forged ahead late. GRACEFUL HEART was taken back in opening stages then steadily gained closer range,
 roused six wide at head of the lane, battled for late lead, could not kick on with LIBERTY KITTEN nearing wire but produced solid effort for second best.
 ISLAND REWARD was rated running through the backstretch, moved up close off top pair still unasked midway through the far turn, sent driving three wide
 turning for home, dueled for lead, dug in gamely, held narrow edge then got outkicked in final stages. CONQUEST HARDCANDY showed speed at the start
 then raced two wide in the first turn, raced behind the early pacesetter then applied pressure to rival in far turn, dueled for lead a furlong out then lacked
 needed response in final sixteenth. HANNAHANNA saved ground and picked up the pace in late backstretch, raced in range along inside in far turn, set
 down two to three wide for drive, showed interest but needed more for late impact. VALEDICTORIAN quicken along rail to take over lead in first turn,
 continued to lead the way with CONQUEST HARDCANDY not far behind, pressured by rival in far turn, dueled for lead a furlong out then gaveway. LUCKY
 SWITCH lost position after opening quarter, roused for more, failed to move on. LINDA MIMI showed early interest then retreated. Run up distance

 Footnotes
 THIRD MAN IN broke out bumping with POLISHED STEEL, was unhurried early, got through a tight opening between horses midway on the turn, appeared
 on the scene suddenly while swinging out four wide, caught SONIDO with a rush nearing the eighth-pole and drew away with a couple shakes of the reins.
 DREAMY MARTINI lagged well back two wide heading to the turn, swung out six wide approaching the stretch, angled in through upper stretch, split horses
 a sixteenth out and was up to nip SONIDO for second at the wire. SONIDO was innermost of a foursome volleying for the lead up the backstretch, held his
 position and eventually came away with the lead by the quarter-pole, drifted out as THIRD MAN IN blew by, then continued to drift and could not hold
 second. SAL'S JET was pinched back between horses at the start, rallied five wide coming off the turn and finished with good courage widest of all. NO
 DINERO battled for the lead between horses three wide, and began to fade entering the stretch. SPINTALK bobbled at the start, chased between horses
 three then two wide on the turn, and tired through the lane inside. TWAS NERO trailed to midway on the turn, came three wide for the drive and went by
 tired horses. ARCHIVERO showed some early speed in the two-path before dropping back on the rail. BLINDING contested the pace widest of four into the
 turn, and faltered after going a half-mile. YES DARLIN stayed within range four wide for a half-mile and had nothing left. POLISHED STEEL bumped with
 THIRD MAN IN and was bounced around between foes after the start, was driven through between horses to battle for the lead two wide, and was giving
 way when steadied near the quarter-pole.

 Footnotes
 NOBLE INDY raced three wide in first turn under slight restraint then matched strides for lead racing along outside of MISSISSIPPI, continued on equal
 terms while settled nicely awaiting riders command, shook reins at head of the lane, tapped once right handed, moved away. MISSISSIPPI raced two wide
 entering first turn then took lead and secured inside position, vied for lead racing inside of NOBLE INDY, settled nicely with rival on top, came under left
 handed drive at head of the lane, battled battle gamely with NOBLE INDY but could not move on with rival in deep stretch, finished clearly second best. TIP
 SHEET stumbled hard and lost iron at the start, regained nearing first turn but needed time to recover and trailed entering the backstretch, moved outside
 position entering far turn, made good run three to four wide. STRONGER raced inside off top flight going through the backstretch, roused for more, raced
 four wide and had no late run. MIAGO raced in contention being rated off top two flights, came under ride but failed to move on. TAP RAP STRIKE raced
 between rivals in second flight then five wide upper stretch to no avail. CHARGE CARD raced four to five wide in first turn, stalked up close through the
 backstretch then retreated in far turn.

 Footnotes
 BEE QUIET broke out bumping with BLUEBIRD BOX at the start, tracked in the clear outside a trio of battling leaders into the turn, ranged up outside
 PEACE ACCORD turning for home, edged away and prevailed after a long drive. PEACE ACCORD broke outward at the start, argued the pace between
 horses in the two-path to the turn, moved inside coming away with the lead near the stretch, and held stubbornly on the rail to save the place. GRAN KING
 OF KINGS was outsprinted early, swung four wide finding his best stride through upper stretch, rallied outside and kept on willingly while brushing with NO
 DRINKING RULES near the wire. NO DRINKING RULES was slow into stride after PEACE ACCORD broke his way after the start, moved off the rail to the
 three-path leaving the turn, lacked room between horses just behind BEE QUIET through deep stretch and brushed with GRAN KING OF KINGS late.
 FALCONER ducked in at the start and checked behind BLUEBIRD BOX, lagged well back to the turn, swung six wide to the lane and gained gradually while
 not a threat. FOUR FREEDOMS contested the pace three wide, and gave way before reaching the stretch. BONUS CARD swung five wide late on the turn
 and lacked a response. TWEETER IN CHIEF argued the pace along the rail for nearly six furlongs, and faltered through the lane. BLUEBIRD BOX broke in
 hitting the side of the gate, then bumped with BEE QUIET after the start, and never reached contention.
