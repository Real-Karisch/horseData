 Footnotes
 TALE OF PRESELI stalked the leaders from close range three wide into the turn, eased out further to be five wide turning for home, reached the front in
 upper stretch and outfinished PROPER PRINCESS under a drive. PROPER PRINCESS was eased back right inside QUEEB and MOZZARELLA down the
 backstretch, came through toward the rail rallying into the stretch, drifted out late and was outfinished. DUNGENESS raced three wide around the turn and
 rallied mildly. STARSHIP HURRICANE raced in midpack for a half-mile, fanned out six wide approaching the stretch and finished evenly. GOLDEN MILA
 raced inside early, came into the lane two wide before moving back to the rail and had no response. BABY ANTONELLA was three to four wide on the turn
 and failed to become a factor. QUEEB pressed the pace inside MOZZARELLA and faded into the stretch. MOZZARELLA set the pace well out in the track,
 entered the stretch four wide and weakened steadily through the last furlong. CRUSHING VICTORY lacked speed and dropped back to trail before going a
 half-mile.

 Footnotes
 MILBRA tracked along the outside in early stages, picked up the pace leaving the backstretch, moved up to engage BEACH TAG midway through the turn
 then took over still in had, came under right handed encouragement shortly and remained well clear. RORAIMA DOS raced in contention then made a move
 between rivals three furlongs out, continued off the top two leaders leaving the turn, was set down driving four wide and produced a solid finish for second
 best. SPINNING STAR picked up the pace leaving the backstretch, continued five to six wide under left then right handed encouragement and gained minor
 share. GEM DIGGER raced up close in opening quarter, lost position midway through the turn then kept on three wide and moved back by a couple rivals in
 the final furlong. DEBRAH'S DANCE vied for the lead in opening stages then sat back and tracked along the rail, roused a couple paths off the inside at the
 head of the lane then flattened out. BEACH TAG vied for the early lead then shook free, came under a challenge from MILBRA midway through the turn,
 was no match for rival past the quarter pole then gaveway in the lane. FAENA lacked early speed and continued in the back, came under strong right
 handed urging in the turn which continued into the lane, drifted out in the final furlong and failed to make an impact. INDIAN FIRE raced near the back along
 the outside through the backstretch, hustled up along the outside into the lane but proved no factor.

 Footnotes
 LENSTAR was off alertly to set the pace inside, shook loose around the turn and widened through the lane under a drive. VALDOCCO bobbled at the start
 and exchanged bumps with SECRET RECRUIT soon after, moved up along the rail through the second quarter, came out for the stretch run and finished
 willingly to be clearly best of the rest. XOCOYOTZIN raced inside and was no threat passing tired horses. BABA TOBI was two to three wide on the turn and
 outrun. SECRET RECRUIT was restless in the gate, exchanged bumps with VALDOCCO soon after the start, chased the winner down the backstretch and
 could not keep pace around the turn. CLASSIC MOVE flashed brief speed three wide, gave way abruptly before going a half and was not persevered with in
 the stretch.

 Footnotes
 BE MY BABY was off slow at the start then continued reserved racing in the back, awaited cue then quickly kicked in when given the green light, circled five
 wide into the lane, set sights on the top pair and ran down rivals to prevail. STORMY ALEXIS (IRE) came out in the first turn then sat in tracking position off
 the pacesetter, made a two wide move for CAFFEINE top stretch, dug in and put a head in front in final sixteenth then quickly lost the top spot to BE MY
 BABY. GRAND FOLLY was rated off the early pace placed just off the inside, was set down driving two to three wide top stretch and continued with good
 response to the wire. CAFFEINE set the pace throughout the backstretch, cut the corner still on top entering the lane, fought back when challenged by
 STORMY ALEXIS, could not hold position in final sixteenth and gaveway. EUPHORICALLY was unhurried racing along the outside, made a move leaving
 the backstretch, loomed up four wide near the quarter pole, raced a bit tight three wide entering the lane, kept on then evened out. GIOVANNA was rated
 along the rail in early stages, waited for room at the quarter pole, shifted out top stretch then lacked a needed rally. KEPT turned head, steadied slightly then
 took a mild awkward step in early backstretch, settled into stalking position along the inside, raced off the top two leaders at the quarter pole then lacked
 response in the lane. SALMON LAKE pulled strongly after the start then continued rank in the first turn, settled in shortly after, raced in range then had
 nothing left in reserve for late stages.

 Footnotes
 RILLA broke alertly and pressed the pace outside SUMMER WHITE, reached even terms approaching the stretch and drew off under a drive. OLYMPIC
 SMOKE was on hold early in a bunched field, split horses rallying on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and wore down SUMMER WHITES for
 second despite being on the wrong lead. SUMMER WHITES set the pace inside hounded by RILLA, was no match for that one into the stretch and lost
 second late. PLAYA ZARAGOZA chased the leaders from close range on the rail, came two wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. MISS REGAL LIGHT
 was behind the leaders racing close-up outside early, clipped the heels of PETRINA'S LOVE and stumbled heading to the turn and dropped back.
 PETRINA'S LOVE was three wide heading to the turn when she had her heels clipped by MISS REGAL LIGHT, and steadily dropped back.

 Footnotes
 CAPITAL CITY shifted out five to six wide shortly after start, sat in tracking position then steadily advanced through the turn, began to duel for the lead in
 upper stretch, lost a slight edge to STARSHIP APACHE in the late drive then fought back gamely from the inside to get back by. STARSHIP APACHE
 angled to the rail after the start then angled out a couple paths, sat off the early speed, roused for more at the quarter pole, showed good response and
 began to duel along the outside of CAPITAL CITY, held a slight edge in the late drive then lacked a needed kick in reserve to battle back in the end.
 MORICHAL raced off the early speed, roused five wide at the head of the lane, set sights on the top two leaders, kicked in willingly and continued gaining to
 the wire. HEY BEAR was bumped between rivals at the start, continued off the early speed, picked up the pace along the rail in the turn, moved into
 contention, angled out a path at the furlong marker then finished evenly. STABLEFORD (GB) hustled up close along the rail then raced in tight approaching
 the half mile marker, bumped with GRAND LORD then steadied back losing all momentum, came out wide in the turn and moved back by tiring foes. TAKE
 TIME TO PRAY vied for the lead at the start then continued up close just off ALL ABOUT DIVA, continued in contention entering the lane then had nothing
 left in reserve for the final furlong. TEXAS RUSTLER broke out and bumped with rivals at the start, continued off the pace, raced three wide in upper stretch
 and lacked a needed rally for impact. EL CAPITAN lacked speed and trailed in the back, hustled up three to four wide in the lane and moved by a couple
 faders. ALL ABOUT DIVA backend got bumped hard coming out of the gate, quickly kicked up from the outside to fight for the lead, took command and
 continued to lead the way in the turn, came under a challenge top stretch and had nothing left for late stages. GRAND LORD raced in two path then bumped
 with rail running STABLEFORD nearing the half mile marker, continued in contention off the top pair at the quarter pole then came up empty in the lane.

 Footnotes
 HALLOWEEN HORROR was well placed along the inside just off the early leaders, rallied two to three wide leaving the far turn, split horses brushing with
 TALK LESS in deep stretch and battled gamely inside the latter to take a close decision. TALK LESS was off a step slow, recovered two to three wide on
 the first turn to sit behind the first flight along with HALLOWEEN HORROR, was asked in earnest four wide approaching the stretch, brushed with
 HALLOWEEN HORROR fighting for the lead and just missed outside that rival. MR. BRIDGER was allowed to settle two wide on the first turn, remained
 toward the rear four wide to the stretch and finished willingly outside to get up for third. SLAM prompted the pace two wide, bid between horses around the
 far turn, moved to the rail in the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. JUMPN' JAMES raced three wide just off the early leaders, moved to challenge
 three wide nearing the stretch, gained a brief lead with a furlong remaining but faltered late. CHAMPIONS MATERNAL set the pace on the rail for nearly six
 furlongs and had nothing left. SOUTHERSIMMARD was well back from the outset and had no response four wide around the far turn. AUSTON'S HAT
 TRICK was steadied while rank approaching the backstretch and showed little else.

 Footnotes
 SUMMER READING got bumped steps after the start then quickly moved up to match strides for the early lead, vied along the outside of DIAMIND
 EARRING then shook free top stretch, continued with a narrow lead and fought off rivals to the wire. SAVINGTIME sat off the early speed while in range of
 the embattled leaders, loomed up along the outside at the quarter pole, came under right then left handed urging, raced within striking distance but could not
 get by stubborn rival in the end. HOLA CHARLOTTE raced off the early pressured pace, saved ground along the inside, dug in three wide a furlong out then
 continued driving between in the final sixteenth, raced within striking distance but lacked the needed kick to get by. DIAMOND EARRING broke out at the
 start then vied for the early lead, continued to battle along the inside of eventual winner, could not continue on equal terms with rival in upper stretch, never
 gave up and fought back gamely until the end. BANREE was unhurried racing near the back, entered top stretch three wide, gained some ground and
 improved position. EXCHANGING SECRETS leaned in then bumped with rival after the start, raced in or near the back, came out wide entering the upper
 stretch, continued wide and moved by a couple tiring rivals. BATTLE TUX vied briefly then remained in touch with the top two leaders, continued in pursuit
 into the turn then failed to keep up the pace, weakened and finished wide in the lane. MISS WILBY hit the gate then came away slowly at the start, raced in
 the back, hustled up along the inside into the lane but failed to move into contention. SWEETWATER got brushed at the start, raced along the rail in early
 stages, entered top stretch two wide and lacked late response.

 Footnotes
 WHITE SMOKE was off a step slow but recovered quickly to run up just behind the leaders along the inside, remained on hold through the turn, came off the
 rail through a large opening at the top of the stretch, caught DYNAMIC DANCER inside the furlong marker and drove clear. DYNAMIC DANCER dueled for
 the lead along the rail, fought off challenges from NFUSION and GEMOLOGISTER and held gamely though unable to contain the winner. NFUSION dueled
 outside DYNAMIC DANCER around the turn, drifted out to the three-path helping create an opening for WHITE SMOKE, kept on willingly outside but was
 outfinished for second. STRAIGHTAWAY MAY raced three wide around the turn and finished with some interest between horses. GEMOLOGISTER
 pressed the leaders three to four wide to the stretch and lacked a late punch. ARCHVILLAIN raced within striking range four to five wide and lacked the
 necessary late response. POKER CHIPS saved ground throughout an even effort and did not become a factor. MONGO NATION raced inside and posed
 no threat. KING STORMY angled in after breaking slowly and was never close. BOLARA was outsprinted four wide. SIMMARD'SRUGBY was outrun
 throughout while two wide.

 FRAMMENTO was taken back off the early pace, continued unhurried then roused for response in the far turn, entered top stretch six wide, came under
 right handed encouragement, angled closer inside, vied for the late lead then edged away. TATHQEEF stalked the top pair of embattled leaders, launched a
 bid for rivals and took over the lead midway through the far turn, continued clear top stretch then came out under left handed encouragement, fought back
 for the late lead but lacked needed kick to move on. KISMET'S HEELS was allowed to settle back in early stages, continued unhurried then began to move
 up closer, roused at the quarter pole, raced in tight quarters while six wide top stretch, was forced to check back sharply, shifted out and continued with
 good response to the wire. VEES BOY vied for the lead racing along the inside of RUSSIAN GREEK, shook free from rival then lost the top spot to
 TATHQEEF, continued in pursuit, drifted out a few paths in upper stretch which impeded the progress of KISMET'S HEELS and MARITIME PULPIT, then
 continued steady bid in the final furlong. STARSHIP ZEUS was well reserved racing near the back, saved ground along the rail, cut the corner entering the
 lane, showed good response, moved up near the lead then failed to sustain bid and evened out. MARITIME PULPIT raced along in range near midpack,
 hustled up in the far turn, moved up into contention then got squeezed back between, checked and lost momentum. JOSHUA'S COMPRISE was unhurried
 in opening stages and continued off the pace, hustled up five wide entering the lane, angled closer inside at the furlong marker then failed to produce a
 needed rally. FLASH TRADING was well reserved racing in the back, urged for response along the rail in the drive, moved by a couple tiring rivals but never
 reached contention. RUSSIAN GREEK was sent from the gate at the start and quickly angled in, vied for the lead racing along the outside of VEES BOY,
 continued to battle into the far turn then failed to move on past the quarter pole and faded through the lane. MONGOLIAN SUNDAY raced near the back,
 urged for response along the outside entering top stretch then lacked a needed rally. ENDER showed early interest then failed to move on past the half.
 STONE raced near midpack, saved ground along the inside then had nothing left in the lane. DOOGIE raced in contention stalking the top pair, lost position
 then continued to retreat into the lane, eased by the wire and walked off after the race. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND JOCKEYS OBJECTION #11

 Footnotes
 SPINNING WHEEL settled off the leaders two wide through the turn, was deftly guided out to split horses rallying in deep stretch and won going away.
 SCUBA SUE bumped with BOLD EMBRACE at the start, set the pace inside, shook off GOODBYE SORROW but could not contain the winner's late rush.
 PORTMAGEE stalked the early leaders inside from close range, angled out in upper stretch to launch a bid and finished evenly. GOODBYE SORROW
 tossed her head around resisting restraint pressing outside SCUBA SUE heading to the turn, fought on to midstretch and weakened in the last furlong.
 LADY COVENTRY steadied behind the eventual winner two wide late on the turn, then gained only mildly in deep stretch. LOVE FLUTE raced well back
 and lacked a response. GOLD TINKER chased the leaders three wide to the top of the lane and faded through the stretch. BOLD EMBRACE bumped with
 SCUBA SUE at the start, raced in midpack three to four wide around the turn and tired. LATENT PRINCESS trailed throughout and had the rider drop the
 whip turning for home.

 Footnotes
 RED PARASOL was taken back at the start, continued unhurried then asked to pick up the pace in the far turn, responded willingly, circled six wide into the
 lane and drew clear. ARTHEMISA was unhurried throughout the backstretch, hustled up between rivals at the head of the lane, lacked room, steadied a
 furlong out, shifted out and finished with good kick. REAGAN'S ODYSSEY set the pace racing just off the inside, vied for the lead at the quarter pole,
 rebroke top stretch, continued to lead the way then got outkicked by late charging rivals. BLUEGRASS SPECIAL was well reserved racing in the back,
 roused eight to nine wide top stretch, produced a strong rally but was too late for serious impact. MAID ON A MISSION tracked the pacesetter throughout
 the backstretch, vied for the lead at the quarter pole, could not match strides top stretch but remained up close then evened out in the late drive. VOW ME
 OVER stalked in early stages, vied three wide near the quarter pole, could not move on with rival but remained in contention then flattened out.
 ALILACTION raced along in range, lacked racing room near the eighth pole, steadied then shifted out and finished with response. KAY WAR was rated off
 the early leaders and saved ground along the rail, hustled up into the lane, showed response but lacked needed kick to move forward. MOONLIT SONNET
 came out four wide in the first turn, stalked along the outside, roused six path top stretch, failed to sustain bid and gaveway. SUMMERTIME MUSIC
 steadied along the rail in the first turn, raced in range near midpack then failed to continue on in the lane. TZI OUR DESTINY raced off the pace, failed to
 move into contention then finished wide in the lane.
