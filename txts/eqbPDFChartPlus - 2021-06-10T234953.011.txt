 Footnotes
 BLUE RIDGE GIRL matched strides for the lead two wide while getting slow fractions for six furlongs then widened through the stretch to win as much the
 best under a strong hand ride. SASSY ANGEL alternated in setting and pressing the pace along the inside for six furlongs then was no match for the winner.
 KISS N FOR FUN had mild late rally. WHATSYOURSIGN stalked the pace along the inside and failed to offer the needed response. GRAB THE LOOT was
 a forward factor in the four path then through after a half. BRAD'S DESTINY trailed.

 balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best under mild urging. CHASING THE STARS was forced out soon after the start,
 disputed the lead along the rail into the clubhouse turn, took back a bit, altered course three wide after a half, came on again, dueled through the second
 turn two wide then was no match for the winner. TIZATALKER broke in front, battled for the lead three wide into the first turn, set a pressured pace into the
 second turn then was outfinished. JUMPN' JAMES drifted out at the start, was quickly righted then failed to menace. SUNSET CATCH drifted inward at the

 furlong marker and burst clear under brisk handling. IT'S NOT ME battled for the early lead four wide, gained a clear advantage on the turn, set the pace
 until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. BOSPHORUS STORM battled early between horses two wide, steadied near the half mile pole then
 went evenly. SONS OF MISSOURI failed to menace. FOREVER KRZ was no threat. JUST ACE contested the early pace along the inside, pressed the
 pace into the stretch then weakened late. SKY PILOT steadied at the start and outrun. BLADERUNNER matched strides for the early lead three wide,

 Footnotes
 STEEL CITY KITTY broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch under brisk handling to win going away. CAT TRAP close up in
 the three path from the start, angled out to the five path on the turn, had a mild late rally and got up for second. MY MYSTERY chased the winner from the
 three path in an even effort. A NEW ANGEL had a mild late rally in the six path. U AND TEQUILA failed to menace. AWESOME MUSIC chased the winner
 from the inside and faded slightly in deep stretch. GONABEFAMOUS lacked room shortly after the start, dropped back and trailed.

 Footnotes
 GATLING stalked the pace from the inside for six furlongs, angled out three wide, split horses entering the stretch, made the lead inside the furlong marker
 while carried out to the five path and won going away under a strong hand ride. HIGH FRANCESCO hopped at the start, chased the leader while getting out
 for a half, put a head in front, set a pressured pace until deep stretch, drifted and finished second best while well handled. WE WILL SHINE never far back,
 checked past the quarter pole when the winner angled out then passed tiring rivals in the stretch. BRILLIANT BOY broke in front, set the pace along the
 inside for nearly a half, kept pressure into the stretch then gave way late. GIFTSOFTHESPIRIT trailed from the gate, advanced in the five path down the
 backstretch to press the pace before a half, had speed into the stretch then faltered.

 lead three wide into the stretch, dug in determinedly and was steadily cutting into the winners' advantage late in the six path. EMMY'S CANDY pressured
 the winner three wide until deep stretch then faded. FORTUNATE GINA with the second flight between horses, lacked the needed response. BAREFOOT
 GYPSY was no threat. LAISSEZ FAIRE also in tight at the start, settled with the second flight three wide and weakened in the stretch.
 IBELIEVEINMIRACLES vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch then stopped.

 THREE DIAMONDS away alertly, made the lead a few strides out of the gate, set the balance of the pace and prevailed under strong handling. BEIJA BOO
 tracked the leader along the inside into the stretch, angled outside the winner and was steadily gaining ground late. SASSY SLEW prompted the pace from
 the three path into the stretch, drifted to the five path and faded. FLYING EMERALD went evenly inside. WICKED LOVE was no factor. PURE JUSTICE
 raced outside and was no threat. SECRET HAUL was a sharp threat four wide into the turn then gave way. DREAMIN OF DELLA was outrun. WHO'S THE
 FAIREST had brief speed.
