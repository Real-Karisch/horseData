 Footnotes
 DALARNA was well placed and settled while racing in range down the backstretch, raced off the top pair and moved through the far turn three wide,
 prompted and roused forward to challenge for the late lead, dueled outside of FRANKLIN TOWERS and got a nose up in time. FRANKLIN TOWERS was
 forwardly placed and stalked down the backstretch, advanced and dueled with ADONIS CREED around the final turn, continued to battle outside of rival in
 stretch run, gained the edge over foe then fought back gamely when DALARMA came up to challenge in final stages and got nipped for the win. ADONIS
 CREED (FR) broke on top, raced along the inside and set the pace down the backstretch, dueled for the lead racing inside of FRANKLIN TOWERS around
 the far turn, continued to battle in the final furlong then had no closing kick left in reserve. GLOBAL ENTRY raced off the inside and settled off the early
 pace, raced two to three wide around the far turn then shifted out wider for the drive, was set down driving six wide and made mild progress. ZORZOR
 raced along the outside and rated off the early pace, hustled up around the far turn then stayed under steady pressure in stretch but lacked the needed
 response for impact. TIGER PAW was allowed to settle and save ground through early stages, continued along the inside around the far turn, came out a
 couple paths entering head of the lane and failed to kick on. GRANDPA KNOWS BEST stalked the pace down the backstretch, launched a bid along the
 inside around the far turn, failed to advance position then gave way. FAMOUS FACT raced in range and tracked the pace down the backstretch, roused for
 more around the far turn but failed to move on and weakened.

 FORTUNATE FRIENDS raced in close contention then advanced up the inside to duel for the lead, continue to battle along inside in upper stretch, gained a
 slim advantage near the furlong grounds then drew clear. GUY CABALLERO raced along the inside in early stages, angled off the inside and chased the top
 trio around the turn, kept on with response four wide under steady pressure in the lane and gained place. SANTIAMEN roused forward and dueled three
 deep around the turn, continued in striking distance at furlong grounds then gave way in final sixteenth. HOLIDAY BONUS raced in range between foes off
 the top flight at the half, kept under a ride with response five wide in stretch run and just missed show. AEQUOR dueled between foes in early stages and
 around the turn then came up tired in final furlong. SHAFT OF LIGHT showed early response but failed to keep pace and retreated.

 Footnotes
 SWEET KAYDEN rated while the closest pursuer of the clear pacesetter, let out a notch and quickly advanced to close the gap midway through the far turn,
 drew on equal terms and dueled for the lead at the quarter pole, continued to battle back in stretch, gained the advantage over foe then took on the
 challenge from DR HARLAN, dug in gamely from the inside position and refused to be denied. DR HARLAN raced off the clear pacesetter down the
 backstretch, advanced into closer contention around the far turn, roused forward three wide and dueled for the lead in stretch run, dug in racing outside of
 SWEET KAYDEN deep stretch and failed to get by. SI ES GOYA rated off the clear pacesetter down the backstretch, hustled up three wide around the turn,
 came out a path wider in drive, stayed in contention and prevailed for a share. AVAST MATEY opened up on top around the first turn, continued with a clear
 advantage while saving ground down the backstretch, challenged by SWEET KAYDEN around the far turn, battled back past the furlong marker then had no
 kick left in late reserve. NOMINAL DOLLARS bumped a bit at the start then raced off the early pace, was set down driving six to seven wide in stretch run,
 showed interest but needed more for late impact. STRONG COMPOSITION settled off the pace and saved ground down the backstretch, hustled up around
 the far turn, kept under steady pressure along outside in stretch run and lacked a needed rally. IL FARAONE raced off the early pace, came under a ride
 around the far turn, kept on two wide in the lane and needed more for late impact.
