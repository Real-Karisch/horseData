 Footnotes
 LUCKY CHRISTIANA quickly took the lead, set all the pace off the rail to the stretch then was under steady hand urging to the line. DURANGA was
 outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but bested the others. NIGHT OF IDIOTS broke alertly but quickly
 relinquished command and was outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no avail. GO SMILEY GO was chasing to the turn, also saved ground to the
 stretch but did not rally. FAIRLY LUCKY pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. SOCIAL ETIQUETTE was
 rank and hard to place on the backstretch then tried to get out nearing the turn, had to steady between rivals at the three eighths and lost any chance.

 QUACK QUO had no speed, raced two wide on the turn then could not threaten the winner but made a late run for second. PRINCE GIOVANNI broke a bit
 slow then was hustled up to contest the pace, saved ground to the stretch then was overtaken by the winner and tired. NEXTPORTOFCALL pressed the
 pace two wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and gave way. EASY DOES IT got outsprinted early, shifted down to the three path on the turn
 but did not rally. TAKE THE FIELD also was outsprinted while outside of EASY DOES IT, came four wide to the stretch then gave way. QUINDAR trailed

 PRETTY POINT was unhurried for a half then responded into the second turn, waited behind rivals to the quarter pole then swung out quickly to get clear
 into the stretch, rallied when set down and closed fast to win going away. TIZZY contested the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, edged
 away to mid stretch then was no match for the winner but gamely saved second. ULTIMATE BLEND pressed the leaders to the second turn, bid three wide
 to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but finished steadily to just miss the place. SAY IT WITH ROSES attended the pace outside the runnerup, was
 two wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and weakened. LILY'S STORM was settled for a half mile, raced three wide to the stretch but did not rally.
 GIRL WITH A CURL chased the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch and weakened in the drive. FULL COURT had no speed and was not
 a factor. OLMODIVA was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 CRAZY SEXY MUNNY chased the leader to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, shifted out for room, rallied when set down and closed fast to
 prevail. SARAZONA TWO set the pace while two wide to the stretch, dug in when challenged in mid stretch then could not stall the winner but gamely saved
 second. GEMAGINE stalked the pace two wide to the stretch, was inside rivals in the drive and could not get by SARAZONA TWO for the place.
 SINAWAVA had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch and was making a mild bid late. SOMARA hustled to press the pace three wide to the stretch,
 pushed up to get on terms in mid stretch but could not sustain that bid and weakened. D'S TWO THUMBS UP tracked the pace to the turn, was fanned four
 wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. TAPEZOID was outsprinted, circled five wide on the turn but tired in the drive.
