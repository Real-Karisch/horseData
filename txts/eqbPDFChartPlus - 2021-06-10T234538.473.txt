 Footnotes
 ICE SHOW held slim lead in opening stages, continued length on top over BEACH GIRL in the turn, saved ground along inside pulled away in stretch.
 BEACH GIRL applied pace pressure to ICE SHOW in opening stages, chased up close through turn, continued steady two wide bid and had to settle for
 second best. PAOLA under steady urging along outside through turn, came out entering top stretch then continued five wide bid to gather show. WHITE AS
 COTTON hustled up out of gate but lacked early foot to move on, saved ground in the turn and gained position upper stretch, failed to sustain bid and
 steadily weakened. IANA raced up close in early stages then faded upper stretch.
