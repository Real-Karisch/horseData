 BOMBAY ALL DAY was settled mid pack to the turn, responded when roused three wide to the stretch then continued to respond in the drive and pushed
 clear to the line. BADGER BOY set the pace and saved ground, kicked away to mid stretch then was tiring and could not hold while not threatened for
 second. LUCKY MESQUITE stalked the pace early, raced two wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. PAUL'S DIVA had no
 speed, came three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. BEL'S BLESSING also had no speed, raced off the rail on the turn and came up empty
 in the drive. BIG FAST CAT chased the pace three wide to the stretch then gave way. HAWTHORNE LANE hustled to press the pace to the turn then was

 Footnotes
 COASTAL STARLITE was a bit slow to begin but was hustled up to chase the pace, had to circle four wide on the turn but rallied once in the stretch, took a
 short lead leaving mid stretch but could not shake loose and dug in gamely for the nod. MISS BOISTEROUS stalked the pace to the turn, was caught out
 four wide to the stretch, rallied to take the lead in mid stretch then battled gamely when hooked by the winner and just missed. GIGET HARBOR was rank
 and uncomfortable behind horses to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then could not impact the top two. PRINCESS RUN IT hustled to contest the pace,
 raced off the rail on the turn, got outkicked to mid stretch then weakened. WANNA was outrun to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then did not rally.
 SECRET PARANOIA hustled to duel PRINCESS RUN IT three wide to the stretch but gave way in mid stretch.

 THALIA was on the pace from the outset, dueled MOMMY ROSE through six furlongs, responded to mid stretch then dug in determinedly to prevail.
 MOMMY ROSE dueled the winner to the stretch while saving ground, stayed gamely to the end of the chute but weakened late. CHERLYNN was settled to
 the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. CARPATHIA stalked the pace to the second turn, raced three
 wide to the stretch then came up empty in the final furlong. NAMORITA had no speed and was never a threat. EARLY'S KID chased the leaders from the
 rail to the stretch then weakened.

 BEHOLD THE GOLD contested the pace from the rail, pushed clear to mid stretch and held driving. PARAWAN checked in the early stages then was
 pushed to establish position, raced three wide to the stretch, angled out for room in mid stretch and finished best of the rest. EVA'S CLASSY BABY tracked
 the pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. SHE'S NO FOOL chased the leaders to the turn, raced two
 wide to the stretch and also failed to respond in the drive. TWO BEARS attended the pace outside the winner, got outkicked and pressed to the stretch but
 weakened in the final furlong. ALL MY HEART settled mid pack to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but also was giving way late. SWEET SUSAN B
 stalked the leaders to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then gave way. MYBABYLOVESLOVING had no speed, was two wide on the turn and did not
 threaten. SUSAN'S DIVA had no speed and was always outrun. SECRET ABBEY was outrun to the turn, raced four wide to the stretch then was not
 persevered with late.

 KITTY BOOM BOOM was well placed pressing the leader to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, took over nearing mid stretch and raced clear
 under steady urging. HOLLYWOOD HILLS had no speed, settled to the half, was two wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but bested the
 others. APACHE PRINCESS chased the pace to the second turn, also raced two wide to the stretch then was making up ground belatedly. DR WYSONG
 was just outside APACHE PRINCESS and three wide to the stretch then also closed a gap without threatening. LAKERBALL had no speed and saved
 ground to no avail. BLUE DIVA was outrun to the half, raced two wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. TIP TOP GAL hustled to the front, set
 the pace for six furlongs but was collared in upper stretch and gave out. LIPPY chased the leaders to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then
 was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. HEATSEEKER BABY stalked the pace to the second turn then saved ground to the stretch but tired in the
 drive. LIZZY'S INTHEGAME trailed throughout.

 IRISH HEATWAVE had good speed and dueled from the rail to the stretch, responded to pressure in the drive and gamely got the nod. OUR SILVER OAK
 was settled to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out, closed fast in the final furlong and just missed. LIEUTENANT DAN tracked the
 leaders to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch got outkicked to mid stretch but dug in determinedly and also just missed. LISTING hustled early
 and crossed over to attend the pace two wide to the second turn, responded gamely in the stretch but was outfinished late. OUR BOLD PRINCE was settled
 to the half, saved ground on the second turn but came up empty in the drive. FEELING STRONG had no speed, raced three wide on the second turn then
 ducked out leaving the quarter pole and weakened. RONSKY'S HOPE was settled for a half, raced three then four wide on the second turn but came up
 empty in the drive. WILD BEAN stalked the pace for six furlongs three wide but tired in the stretch. MOON HOUSE had no speed and was never a factor.
 LEADVILLE also had no speed, was forced out five wide on the second turn then gave way in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 BRONZINO (FR) had good speed and dueled three wide to the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, responded when challenged by BAY AREA in
 mid stretch and dug in gamely to hold. STREET MOXIE stalked the winner to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then finished willingly but was
 too late. AZTEC WARRIOR was settled to the half, got fanned four wide on the second turn then finished in a rally but was too late. HAY DUDE (GB) was
 four then five wide to the backstretch, tracked the pace to the second turn, raced four wide to the stretch then also closed well in the late stages. BAY AREA
 pressed the winner from the rail to the second turn, pushed up to engage for the lead in mid stretch but could not go by and weakened late. ROYAL
 BANKER (GB) settled mid pack to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. IF I HAD A NICKEL also settled mid pack,
 was three wide on the far turn but finished evenly in the drive. SON OF THE SOUTH tracked the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then
 weakened. PEPPER CROWN had no speed, was three wide but never was a factor. GOING FOR THE WIN had no speed and was always outrun. POST
 ROCK showed little.
