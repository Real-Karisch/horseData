 then interfered with ABOUT OUT TIME and prevailed under strong urging. WILDWOOD DEJAVU was hustled from the start, showed good speed then
 moved clear midway down the backstretch, raced inside early on the turn then shifted to the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, came under the whip
 in upper stretch, was collared at the sixteenth-pole, fought on well to the wire but missed while clear for the place. BAR RYDER leaned out at the start,
 settled at the rear of the field, was urged along while three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and finished

 roused at the five-sixteenths, gained six wide into the stretch, drifted in some while looming a threat into the final furlong but was outfinished while clear for
 the place. J D'S GIRL broke open the front of his stall door prior to the start, raced just off the pace while between horses, chased four wide on the turn,
 came five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. TOUCH OF GRAY broke a
 step slow, settled at the rear of the field, went four then three wide early on the turn, dropped to the two path late on that bend, came under the whip inside
 the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. TRUST IN LOVE was off slow, spotted the front a couple of lengths, settled towards the rear, saved
 ground under urging on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch under the whip and failed to rally. GENIE'S GLORY chased the pace on the outside, went
 five then six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and tired. TALE OF LA COMETE chased the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, came

 Footnotes
 LETITHAPPENQUICK bumped soundly with foes on both sides at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along while three then four wide on the turn,
 came five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. MAN
 CAMP chased the pace on the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead nearing the quarter-pole,
 inched clear under a drive in upper stretch but was overtaken while able to get the place. GRAND OMEGA bumped with rivals on both sides at the start,
 settled at the back, went four wide early on the turn then dropped to the two path, was roused while near the inside at the quarter-pole, espied a seam along
 the rail near the three-sixteenths but opted against it, angled to the outside outside the furlong marker and finished with late energy to just get the show.
 THE RAYSTER was bumped just after the start and had the rider lose her left iron, raced off the pace while attempting to regain the iron, started the turn in
 the two path, finally regained the iron while three wide at the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and also finished with late energy but
 just missed the show. SILENT CRY was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LAST OF
 THE LUCK was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the inside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved to the two path near the three-eighths,
 came three wide into the stretch then was asked for his best and had nothing left. LOOKIN AT PRIORITY was bumped at the start then forced into another
 rival, raced off the pace while urged along, advanced leaving the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn and came up empty. RONDA'S CUSTOM set the
 clear pace, raced inside on the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and faded. AMBASSADOR HOUSE broke in and bumped with a foe, settled well
 back on the outside, went five wide on the turn, floated seven wide into the stretch and was no factor.
