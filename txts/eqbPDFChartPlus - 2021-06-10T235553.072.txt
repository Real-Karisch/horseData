 DESERT BLACK pressed the pace of PETE AND JACK from the inside, steadied nearing the half mile pole, checked nearing the five-sixteenths, angled in
 approaching the stretch and finished willingly. PETE AND JACK was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail and weakened through the
 final furlong. ATTERCOP settled off the leaders early, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. REAL CHANGES broke in, lacked early foot, raced
 three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SIERRA ROMANCE showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace.

 Footnotes
 TAPTOO was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the fore inside the furlong
 marker and edged away through the closing yards. ATHLEISURE broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with SPIRITS FANCY from the inside,
 disposed of that arrival before going a half, opened a clear lead and gave way grudgingly to the winner in the drive. COLOUR OF MONEY settled off the
 leaders early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and again in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. SASSY DEBS
 FIREFLY broke out, chased the leaders while racing five-wide and failed to gain in the drive. NINADAVINA lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn
 and was not a factor. WILD WILKO was off a step slow, lagged early and did not reach contention. SPIRITS FANCY disputed the pace with ATHLEISURE
 while racing three-wide, weakened after going three furlongs and was eased through the lane.
