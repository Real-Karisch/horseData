 Footnotes
 COURTMEWITHCARATS established the front and showed the way four to five wide down the backstretch under some pressure from JAX to the outside,
 tucked three then two wide at the seven-sixteenths, remained patiently handled through the turn, spun just off the inside for home roused for the drive,
 edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. SPECIAL RISK three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked inside at the
 seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home angled out to the three path, continued the angle to swing five wide at the quarter pole,
 closed well to cut into the winner but could not reel that one in before the wire while well clear of the rest and second best. JAX five to six wide down the
 backstretch prompting the leader one path to her inside, followed the tuck by that rival to chase three wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway
 on the bend, swung four wide for home, weakened in the stretch while along for the show honors. BEAR SHE GOES six to seven wide down the
 backstretch just off the pace, tucked to the three path half a mile from home, came under light coaxing taking to the inside three furlongs out, cut the corner
 into upper stretch and tired. BANK ON THE LAKE chased just off the inside until angled three wide put to urging at the three-eighths, continued three wide
 into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 BULLHEADED BOY lunged out with his initial step, raced from off the inside throughout, went about on the clubhouse bend from the two path, shifted out
 four wide shortly after stepping onto the backstretch, was in the same one entering the far turn, got asked for more spinning into the stretch, was near the
 five path at the three-eighths pole, kicked into his best and appeared to poke a head down in front by the eighth pole, beating ONECATS CHANCE, itself
 rallying with good energy at the time, to the punch, successfully held off a pair of opponents, one to the right and the other to the left then edged away.
 TAOISEACH tucked along the inside route before reaching the conclusion of the homestretch, got rated keeping watch on the front runners, managed to get
 eased into path two midpoint on the second bend, was then set to some brisk hand urging, but only for approximately a sixteenth or so, pilot forced to take
 hold once more, idling behind a wall of four spread out from the rail onward a short distance up ahead, had the rider commit to a ride angling into a usable
 seam in the three path a few jumps past the quarter pole, split rivals in the final furlong then finished willingly to garner the place. ONECATS CHANCE
 remained along the inside route after an apparent getaway, disdained a potential pocket journey and was sent onto path two early on the first turn, departed
 the backstretch three wide, was put to some urging after falling back a bit, got fanned out into path six during the initial portion of the stretch, closed in to
 loom boldly at the start of the last eighth pole, vied with vigour a little while longer then flattened out. BACK SCATTER coaxed along by the rider while
 attending the pacesetter from the two path, was between rivlas for much of the trip on the far turn, gave way. BUSTIN THE BANK gained command after the
 break, was lighlty ridden setting the splits from along the inside, came under heavy pressure as three-quarters was being completed, gave into it by upper
 stretch and steadily backed away. ONE SIDED three wide on both turns, folded.

 Footnotes
 AIX EN PROVENCE established the front under coaxing and showed the way from the two path under some pressure from NORTHERN SCREAMER to the
 outside, tucked to the inside half a mile from home, showed the way through the turn patiently handled, got headed nearing the quarter pole, spun just off
 the inside for home under a ride, took back command straightened away for home, dug in inching away to the eighth pole, dug in game to hold safe to the
 finish. NORTHERN SCREAMER prompted the pace three then two wide through the turn, took over command nearing the quarter pole and swung three
 wide at that station, dug in and was headed straightened away, fought on through to the wire but was ultimately repelled. MIDNIGHT BOUNTY broke out at
 the start bumping DREAMBOAT ANNIE, chased four then three wide coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into upper stretch, offered
 up a mild kick for the show honors. SPECTACULAR FLASH chased the pace along the inside, the rider at times pulling on the near side rein stoutly as his
 charge attempted to drift out into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was
 outkicked. IS SHE HOT chased just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner for home, weakened in the
 stretch. ROMAN REIGN broke in at the start bumping DREAMBOAT ANNIE, chased three to four wide under urging from three furlongs out, swung four to
 five wide for home, offered no response. DREAMBOAT ANNIE bumped between foes at the start, chased five then four wide under urging from midway on
 the turn, cornered four wide for home and tired.

 Footnotes
 CAROLINA COURAGE shifted into the two path proceeding along the backstretch, ignoring some light attention with the stick in the area of the right
 shoulder and a snug grip on the reins from the opposite side, continued to take up the chase from the same path during the run around the bend, picked up
 interest leaving the five-sixteenths marker, made it into upper stretch and was switched over to stronger handling, narrowed in, altered course in the vicinity
 of the sixteenth pole, wore down the leader in the final forty yards to prove best. GROTON ST SCOUT underwent a three wide pursuit, got set down for the
 drive home, took over at the furlong grounds, then held out until a few strides shy of the wire. FAIR REGIS saved ground for most of the trip to the
 five-sixteenths marker, was taken to the outside at that station, fanned out from upper to midstretch until approximately six wide, ralliied well to take the
 show award. NEW YORK BOURBON was hustled from the gate to establish control, cut over to the rail, fended off another, that being BUSTIN GOLD,
 positioned out in path two, wasn't able to turn back the second place finisher during the early portion of the stretch run, backed away after relinquishing.
 MISS EMILY'S SMILE stacked five wide at the half mile pole, continued along from a considerable distance from off the inside, swung into the stretch and
 had no rally. MISS MEADOWBROOK slow to settle into stride, underwent a ground-saving journey, cut the corner not having been called upon for her best,
 picked up momentum right around the three-sixteenths marker, was put to some encouragement a sixteenth later and made some headway, with only minor
 spoils to show for it. HYPNOTICA hung out four wide stepping onto the turn, tired. PRIMA ESTRELLA sluggish after the start, departed the backstretch
 towards the two path, was never in a contending position. BUSTIN GOLD vied for the lead from the two path to upper stretch before giving way. J. R.'S
 GOOD GIRL took up the chase from the two path on the turn and failed to menace. SHINING WITH LUCK three wide and offering some resistance on the
 bit at the half mile pole, gave way.

 Footnotes
 SUMMER OF JOY chased the pace along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind the leader, remained on hold until tipped out to the two path
 when roused three-sixteenths from home, rallied to tackle the leader just inside the sixteenth pole, dug in to prevail. STORMY PRINCESS cut the pace
 along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, came under growing threat from the
 aforementioned foe and was headed a sixteenth out while clear of the rest for the place honors. CHRISTENING chased two to three wide under
 encouragement with five-sixteenths to run, angled four wide for home, improved position for the show honors. HAVEANICEWEEKEND raced four then three
 wide in aim of the front, got put to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide at the quarter pole, weakened in the final eighth. GONNA BE MORGAN
 brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three to four wide coming under urging midway on the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered no
 response. ROSA DORATA prompted the pace from the two coming under a ride with five-sixteenths remaining, continued just off the inside for home, tired
 in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 DISCREET ENCOUNTER raced three wide around both turns, cut into the gap as the second fraction was being recorded, contended for the lead as the
 widest of three making its way from the top of the second bend to its end, was still in hand taking over in the general of the three-sixteenths marker, got
 asked for some run of his own a sixteenth down the road, dug in well enough in the final stages to fend off the second place finisher. DUBLIN MY MONEY
 settled into the two path during the run leading up to the clubhouse turn, was pulling on the bit prior to stepping onto it and then while making her way
 around it, appeared to settle down to a more professional manner as the half was being reached, got angled outward beginning from the five-sixteenths
 pole, swung wider and wider until nearly six wide with an eighh to go, shifted inward several paths in deep stretch, got staved off and had to settle for the
 place. FLUX CAPACITOR took up the chase two wide from midpack, was put to a drive taking path four for entrance into the stretch, got turned back. SAVE
 THE TIGERS stalked the pacestter from the two path, roped in the former loose leader after the half had been completed, prompted the issue from between
 opponents on the far turn, kept up the pressure until a short distance past the quarter pole then weakened. CRAWFISH SHORTS swung two wide into the
 backstretch, departed it from the same path, came under the whip angling three wide into the stretch, made some gain, although never posing a serious
 threat. AWESOME ANTHONY sped from the competition after the break, got guided over to the inside route, felt a hint of others being in the same race as
 the half was being completed, felt even more pressure after stepping onto the far turn, vying as the innermost of three, got caught in upper stretch and gave
 way. GIANT FIVE WAYS three wide on the first turn, failed to menace. IT MUST BE NICE saved ground to no avail. TROUBLED LOVER underwent a four
 wide trip to the quarter pole and folded. BIG CAT hung out three wide on each turns, came four wide into the stretch with no offering.

 Footnotes
 CARDS OF STONE away without incident, attained a prominent position, shadowed the leader from the two path, continued along under the same set up
 for over three-quarrters, began to chop away at the deficit during the last few jumps leading up to the quarter pole, was directly abreast of BRIMSTONE
 bidding with confidence settling into the stretch, had already taken over when put to a drive approaching the furlong marker, possessed his largest
 advantage with a sixteenth remaining, lost some of it late, but held sway. BECKER'S GALAXY sat within range two wide, began to move to the outside
 leaving the five-sixteenths pole, wound up in the four path by the conclusion of the maneuver, straigthened away and took off in earnest after the front
 runners, gained well, but got staved off. CAUSE I'M ALEX rode the rail, got roused approaching the five-sixteenths pole, got sent four wide into upper
 stretch, rallied well enough to be along for the show. VINCENTO broke about a length the slowest off all, sat unhurried in the two path for three-quarters,
 seemed to momemtarily skid over the surface altering course a few paths towards the middle of the strip in midlane, lacked the needed late response.
 CHILLY BON BON took up the chase frm the two path, was asked to pick up by midpoint on the far turn, failed to do so. BRIMSTONE was under a firm hold
 established control, carved out the pace while taking the inside route, with the eventual winner in accompaniment out in path two, had that one increase its
 pressure after six furlongs had been run, got turned loose heading for home, yielded soon afterwards and tired. RYDER ROAD raced three wide on both
 turns, was put to a drive at the three-quarters pole and gave way.

 Footnotes
 RARE ROSE chased just off the inside, tucked to the rail at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing midway on the turn, swung three wide for home,
 rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth, took command seventy yards from the finish and inched away to the wire. NEGEV chased along the
 inside from mid pack, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors in the final jumps. QUINCY GIRL
 dueled from the two path with CLAUDIA'S VISION to her inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, came in
 straightened away bumping and placing her main pace rival in tight three-sixteenths out forcing that one to briefly steady, took over command, inched away
 to the eighth pole, dug in and was collared seventy yards out, kept on for the show honors. CITY TRAPPER three wide off the duel, came under coaxing at
 the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, made no late headway. DON'S BIG APPLE chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
 three-eighths, continued three to four wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked to the finish. ANNA THERESA two to three wide detached at
 the rear early on, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and was outkicked. CLAUDIA'S VISION hustled from the
 gate, dueled inside of QUINCY GIRL from the get go, came under coaxing midway on the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch clinging to the lead, got
 steadied when bumped and put in tight by QUINCY GIRL who came in at the three-sixteenths, got displaced on the front and tired through to the finish.
 There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of CLAUDIA'S VISION alleging interference against QUINCY GIRL in upper stretch which was dismissed prior
 to the race being declared official.
