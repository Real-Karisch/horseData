 Footnotes
 VIVACIOUS V. V. well placed early from the inside, tracked the pace up the backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, angled outside, responded
 and was just up the final stride. BLING IT ON BABY broke sharp from between foes, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch, remained
 engaged through the drive but was outfinished late. PRINCESS SAMURAI up close early from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, battled through the
 drive but was outfinished in a three way photo. CAUSATION forced the early pace from the inside, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace.
 CROWN AND SEVEN could only improve position. LUCKY LORRETTA went evenly. BOURBON N BOOTS was no factor. UNREAL BABY had a steady
 fade. HARBOR JEDI was never close. BELLA CAPELLI showed little.
