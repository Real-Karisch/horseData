 Footnotes
 FORMAL CLASS settled early, rallied the two path around the turn, angled out sharply in early stretch, quickly opened a clear lead in midstretch and was
 ridden out to the end. QUEEN FRANCIS broke in a tangle, angled to the rail while alternating on the front into the final furlong then proved little match for
 the winner. ANOTHER GIRL was content to lag inside following a slow break, swung wide into the stretch and passed tired ones with a belated run.
 STELLA NOVA dueled two wide into the stretch then drifted out through late stretch while tiring. FIND THE MONEY wasn't far back along the inside early
 then was tiring when forced to alter course in late stretch when STELLA NOVA drifted. PISTOL ANDIE was outrun. ECLIPTICALSROSETTE was outrun
 two wide. EXCLUSIVE SYMPHONY stopped and was eased up late.

 Footnotes
 HAPPY MARGARITA ran towards the rear while saving ground, swung into the stretch in the two path with a rally but hit her best stride inside the sixteenth
 pole with a surge and got up in time. PACEMAKER was slow out of the gate but went up and tracked the pace while on the inside, stuck to the rail and ran
 all out through the stretch, took the lead about seventy yards from the wire but was sniped by the closer. WARRIOR'S SHADOW hit the gate at the start but
 was quick to the front, held the lead comfortably while in the two path, dug in when asked for more but was caught about seventy yards before the finish.
 BINARY BOURBON stalked the pace on the outside while going two wide around the turn, swung into the stretch in the four path and was all out through
 the finish but was no match. ARK OFTHE COVENANT hit the gate and ducked out at the start forcing OFFLEE LOVABLE out, quickly got into stride and
 chased the pace on the outside, went three wide into the stretch and finished evenly. HAY YOU GUYS tracked the pace between horses going two wide
 around the turn, swung into the stretch in the five path but lacked a rally. GOOD N DIRTY hesitated at the break but went up to stalk the pace on the inside,
 swung into the stretch in the four path but weakened. TOTALLY TABOO ran towards the rear while going two wide around the turn but had no rally.
 OFFLEE LOVABULL hit the gate at the start but was forced out when ARK OFTHE COVENANT ducked out, shook it off and tracked the pace on the
 outside, went three wide around the turn but grew tired. DEPUTIZED chased the pace between horses while going two wide around the turn then folded up.
 SURPRISE TALENT dwelt in the gate then was completely void of speed, went around the turn in the three path but was eased for the drive.

 STORM APPROVAL RVF was content to lag inside, came out three wide while rallying on the final turn, swung wide into the stretch and quickly drew away
 leaving the furlong grounds while under mild urging. BASIC TRAINING stayed inside and outfinished tired ones in an even effort. COMMON
 DENOMINATOR wasn't far back outside, raced three wide around the final turn, gave her best between rivals into the final furlong then flattened out.
 HOLIDAY SHOT moved two wide between rivals to a short lead into the far turn, remained in control into the final furlong then tired. TEX MEE A KISS
 moved to a clear lead early on the first turn, made the way along the rail to the far turn, remained prominent between rivals to the final furlong then tired.
 OFFLEE CHARMER saved ground to no avail. DAWNING SKY raced three wide and tired. FACE THE WATER was outrun.

 gamely through the stretch and edged clear for the win. MISS MANATEE was quick to the front and went two wide around the turn, dug in when asked for
 more and was outfinished. SOBEIT SYLVIA chased the pace on the outside going four wide around the turn then weakened. HYGH LIFE tracked the pace
 while going two wide around the turn, swung into the stretch in the six path, ran all out but was no match. ROLLING MO sat well rated off the pace while on
