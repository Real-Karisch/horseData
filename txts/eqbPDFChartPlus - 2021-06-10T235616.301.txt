 COTTONWOOD CANYON stalked the dueling leaders while inside on the first turn and into the far turn, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch,
 rallied steadily and was along in time. WATER MOCCASIN battled along the inside on the clubhouse turn, shifted out two wide before a half, prompted the
 remainder of the pace and finished second best. YOUNG AMERICAN away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide through the first turn, dropped inside,
 maintained a narrow lead until deep stretch then faded. GHOSTWALKING failed to menace. STRONGBOW was no threat. CAN'T REMEMBER was no
 factor.

 and won going away. DAPPER DEWEY never far back, slipped through along the inside to make the lead on the turn, set the pace into the stretch then was
 no match for the winner but gamely held on for second. MINE'S DIALED IN raced wide down the backstretch, angled in on the turn and was steadily gaining
 ground late in the four path. DIDDY DEW had brief speed. PERPENDICULAR was no factor. PASSIONATE VICTOR away alertly, set a pressured pace off
 the rail in the four path into the turn then had nothing left .

 BIG OHIO never far back, responded readily when set down, rallied to make the lead in the four path past the furlong marker and surged clear under brisk
 handling. CAPT BILLY BUD stalked the pace near the inside into the far turn, shifted outside the leader, drifted to the four path in a stretch long drive and
 got up for second. LUNAR HEAT broke in front, set a pressured pace along the inside until deep stretch then was outfinished. HORSERADISH reared at the
 start then failed to menace. FREEKSON unhurried early, inched closed along the inside on the second turn then leveled off. DOC'S GOIN MOBIL was no
 factor. PRIVATE DRIVE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn then gave way. TYPOTHETAE vied for the early lead three wide and was through after
 a half.

 IAMTHEBEST vied for the lead along the inside into the turn, dropped back a bit near mid turn, altered course to the five path entering the stretch, made the
 lead near the furlong marker and won as much the best. COPPER TRAIL broke in front, set a pressured pace off the rail in the three path to mid stretch then
 was no match for the winner. NUNS ISLAND stalked the pace into the turn, moved closer two wide approaching the top of the stretch, was shut off by the
 winner causing her rider to check hard then finished with good courage. MISS LADY BIRD was in tight at the start, sprinted up to press the pace two and
 three wide into the stretch then faded late. SASSY SISTER vied for lead the lead in the four path and lacked the needed response. GOFAR KRISTA was no
 factor. KRISTA'S BEST was outrun. PERFECTION EXPRESS broke a step slot, bore in and was no threat. WAFFLESORPANCAKES was through early.
