 CANDRASA stalked the pace early, swung into the six path in the far turn while making a bid but was no match for the winner in the stretch run. HAUTE
 PROSPECT tracked the pace early, was shuffled back along the far turn, was on the inside entering the lane, came again in the stretch and moved up.
 SHAMELESSFI fanned into the seven path in the far turn and improved position. NIGHT BEFORE chased the pace early, pressed the leader down the
 backstretch, fanned into the five path in the far turn and faded down the lane. BIRD STREET was unprepared and broke in the air at the start then was

 Footnotes
 KENTUCKY KITTEN was unhurried early on, swung into the six path in the far turn, rallied into the lane, took over command and drew off late under a
 steady drive. FOX CHASE trailed the field early on, swung into the six path in the far turn, rallied into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match
 for the winner in the final stages. ZARMAN was bothered at the start and raced back early on, fanned into the seven path in the far turn while making a bid
 but weakened late in the stretch run. RIVER KID was back early on and improved position in the stretch run. CAPTAIN KITTEN came out at the start and
 raced back early on, took over and led into the lane from the five path but faltered late in the stretch drive. PINTSIZE came out at the start and raced back
 early on, swung into the six path in the far turn while making a bid but faded late in the drive. SUCCESS PHIL was well placed early on, was blocked and
 steadied near the quarter pole and was empty down the lane. UNION RATE pressed the pace early, shifted into the three path in the far turn and was tired
 in the stretch. STRINGTOWN was through after a half. PRAIRIE SCHOONER was through after three quarters. PASS SET HIT set the pace for a half then
 folded up. CLIFF'S NOTES had early speed then retreated.
