 Footnotes
 LA BARESINA dueled outside rival into and around the first turn, edged away from that foe passing quarter marker, padded that lead into the lane, came out
 slightly and was kept to task to the wire. LITTLE BITTY CHER contested the early pace from the inside, was put in tight quarters along the rail on the first
 turn, lost contact with the winner nearing final bend, came out bit in the lane and held the place. GUNNY stalked while saving ground early, angled off the
 inside, chased two then three wide into the stretch and was denied the place. VICTORIOUS NATION was off awkwardly and slow, settled outside rival, was
 fanned out by same foe into and on the first turn, came back in some but failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 GOLDIMAX checked off heels early and was content to chased from the inside, roused leaving second turn, made steady progress inside, rushed up inside
 pacesetter and surged to front entering the stretch, came out bit and safely held off runner-up. EDDIE SUE chased from off the rail then outside rival, angled
 out into final turn, was caught four then five wide into the stretch, rallied strongly from the outside but ran out of ground. INDY DEVIL'S ARMS stepped to the
 front and dictated the pace while slightly off the fence, raced two wide around the last turn, overtaken entering the stretch, came in bit and weakened. EDIE
 WIGGINS forced the early pace from between rivals or two wide early, remained in striking position, came out bit around the last turn and lacked needed
 late punch. BIG ADVENTURE was close up early, continued three wide around first two turns then four wide on the last bend, remained well off the rail and
 weakened. TULIPIA settled inside, saved ground chasing the pace, dropped back around the last bend and faded.

 ARIGATO quickly sped clear, set uncontested pace from the inside, stretched margin under asking into last bend and proved much best under steady late
 handling. I B TANNER settled inside, stalked along the rail, bumped with ARGYLE CUT into second bend, continued inside and gained the place.
 HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE tracked pace from the inside, saved ground throughout and gamely held the show. ARGYLE CUT broke very tardily, settled
 outside rival, continued two wide, was bumped in hind quarters into second turn and lacked needed late response. PRESSURE TIME reserved from the
 inside, angled out passing three-eighths marker, moved up bit four wide around last turn, remained wide into the lane and flattened out bit late. JAN'S KID
 was slow into stride, chased from off the rail, remained three or four wide and failed to menace. ZOOMZOOMANIA stalked while outside rival, remained two
 or three wide to the final turn and weakened.

 Footnotes
 LUCKY VIEWS chased from along the fence, roused approaching final turn, steadied inside rival passing quarter marker, dropped back then re-rallied
 inside, surged from along the fence in deep stretch and won the bob on the wire. PRESIDENTSKY was closest in pursuit while slightly off the rail, under
 asking around last turn, came out in upper stretch, reeled in lead approaching the wire and lost narrow decision while three deep on the wire. JET SEEKER
 was sent up inside shortly after break and sped well clear, set uncontested pace into the stretch, came out slightly, had lead dissolve in final sixteenth and
 was collared from between rivals in the final feet. A P PHANTOM settled well off the rail, was four wide on first turn, continued on same path or three wide to
 the stretch and finished willingly. SHARP HOOQ unhurried while four wide early, chased three wide then came out further entering the stretch and failed to
 threaten. UPTOWNFREDDYBROWN raced outside winner early, continued bit wide and weakened.

 Footnotes
 WEMISSSTACY contested the pace from along the inside, edged away around the final turn, came out slightly in the drive and gamely lasted. UNCLE
 STEVE'S GIRL chased from the inside, remained along the rail, angled out on the final bend, rallied strongly from between rivals and narrowly missed. SEE
 THE LITE stalked while three wide then outside rival, came in some, rallied in the drive from the inside and gained share of the show. JUST A GEM set or
 forced the pace while outside winner, lost contact on the last turn, drifted out into the stretch and held for a share of third. SHESA RANEGADE unhurried
 early, lugged out around the first turn, remained well off the rail and did not rally. ASTOUNDING ABBY stalked from the inside, saved ground throughout
 and weakened.
