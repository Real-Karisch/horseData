 determined drive but hung late. SWEET ROMANCE settled in midpack, angled from three to five-wide late turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in
 the final 16th. RARE APPEAL raced off the pace, was hustled from midpack along the rail on the turn, chased hard into the stretch then finished evenly.
 SPRING EDITION stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, lost his path upper stretch, altered course, gave chase but did not menace.
 CAPE ROMANCE, away slowly and off the early pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but never reached contention. BILOXI BAY raced off the pace,

 Footnotes
 QUEEN DEL VALLE was fractious in the starting gate, broke a length on top, settled to stalk along the inside as WILL SHE surged to the front, saved
 ground, angled two-wide late on the turn, launched a bid in early stretch, dueled down the lane and edged clear in time. WILL SHE rushed up to the front
 shortly after the start, saved ground on the turn, dueled down the stretch, fought valiantly nearing the wire but just missed. INDIA MANTUANA raced in
 midpack, came off of the rail late on the turn, angled out in early stretch, chased the dueling leaders down the late and was strong in the late yards but could
 not reach place. SILENT SONET raced in midpack, rode the rail through the turn and finished gamely. VICTORY TO VICTORY raced in midpack on the
 outside, was two and three-wide on the turn and chased in vain down the stretch. SUPERDUPER SKY was void of early speed, saved ground on the turn,
 drifted out in early stretch and offered a belated rally. R NAJA stalked the early pace, raced two-wide on the turn, angled four-wide at the 5/16ths pole and
 faltered in the final 3/16ths. JUST BE KIND broke outwards, lacked early speed, was two-wide on the turn, drifted out in early stretch and was never a
 threat. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED AND SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS AN OFFICIAL TRACK RECORD

 Footnotes
 GUY CABALLERO dropped back to the rear in the early stages, was three-wide on the clubhouse turn, continued to race on the outside down the
 backstretch, entered the far turn racing three-wide, commenced a rally nearing the 1/4 pole, angled four-wide turning for home, continued to rally down the
 stretch, surged within the final furlong and proved best late. KING AND HIS COURT was away in midpack, saved ground on the opening turn, skimmed the
 rail into contention as they rounded the far turn, stuck with the rail path down the stretch, reached the leader past the 1/8th pole, dueled in the final 1/16th
 and got the better of STATE OF HONOR but could not hold off GUY CABALLERO, although game to the wire. STATE OF HONOR got out on top and set a
 rated pace, saved ground on the opening turn, maintained comfortable control of the tempo down the backstretch, came off of the rail late on the far turn,
 was headed at the 1/16th pole, dueled in late stretch and was outkicked. TIZ A SLAM lacked early speed, raced two-wide on the clubhouse turn, angled out
 past the half-mile pole, entered the far turn racing two-wide, trailed the field as they approached the 1/4 pole, was on the inside path entering the stretch and
 finished gamely. AVIE'S MESA bore outwards at the start, raced in midpack, was three and two-wide on the opening turn, commenced a bid while racing
 three-wide at the 5/16ths pole, appeared to try to lug in at the top of the stretch, failed to reach STATE OF HONOR and flattened out down the lane.
 EXPEDITION showed brief speed, tracked the pacesetter, raced two-wide on the opening turn, maintained his position down the backstretch, continued to
 race two-wide into the far turn, began to tire nearing the 5/16ths pole and came up empty in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 HOLY HELENA stalked the leaders while racing three-wide on the clubhouse turn, continued to track the pace down the backstretch where she raced
 between horses, was three-wide entering the far turn, angled to the inside at the 5/16ths pole, switched back to the outside at the top of the stretch,
 launched a bid and drove to the lead within the final furlong. MYTHICAL MISSION raced in midpack heading into the opening turn where she raced from
 three to two-wide, angled to the outside during the backstretch run, advanced to stalk the leaders, raced four-wide into the far turn, launched a bid and took
 the lead heading into the stretch but was collared past the furlong pole and had to settle for place. INFLEXIBILITY ducked inwards at the start causing her
 rider to lose his balance but quickly advanced to a stalking position, saved ground on the opening turn, maintained her position down the backstretch but
 was shuffled to midpack as STALLION HEIRESS and MISS ADELE simultaneously faltered, angled three-wide past the 5/16ths pole to avoid those foes,
 rallied between horses in the stretch and got up for show. ENSTONE raced four-wide into the clubhouse turn, stalked the leaders entering the backstretch
 where she began to press while racing on the outside, was three-wide heading into the far turn, cleared to the lead at the 3/8ths pole, angled to the rail to
 save ground for the rest of the turn but was headed turning into the stretch, was no match for the top two and lost show in the final yards. CINDERVELLA
 broke outwards, lacked early speed, was just off of the rail on the opening turn, commenced a rally on the far turn, angled three-wide at the 1/4 pole and
 chased to the wire while not threatening. ELLAN VANNIN lacked early speed, raced three-wide on the clubhouse turn, got up into midpack down the
 backstretch, raced three-wide into the far turn, was hustled into contention at the 5/16ths pole but could not sustain her bid and flattened out in the stretch.
 FINANCIAL RECOVERY dropped back early, was in a bit tight nearing the 7/8ths pole, raced two-wide on the opening turn, had only two foes beaten racing
 down the backstretch, entered the far turn racing two-wide, angled four-wide on the far turn, switched to the inside path entering the stretch and lacked a
 serious rally. GERTIE T was taken back early, advanced to midpack on the clubhouse turn where she saved ground, came off of the rail on the backstretch,
 ranged from two to five-wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. GHOSTLY PRESENCE stalked the early pace, was two-wide between horses entering
 the opening turn, angled to the rail and dropped back to midpack entering the backstretch, was under a ride on the far turn, angled four-wide at the 1/4 pole
 and flattened out in the stretch. INSPIRED VOW was void of early speed and trailed the field, was well back entering the far turn, drifted out turning for
 home and passed the tiring foes. STALLION HEIRESS got out to set the early pace, was pressed down the backstretch, lost the lead at the 3/8ths pole,
 faltered rounding the far turn, was eased across the wire and was walked off. MISS ADELE showed early speed, was two-wide on the opening turn, pressed
 the leader down the backstretch, entered the far turn racing two-wide where she began to weaken, was eased up on in early stretch and was walked off.
