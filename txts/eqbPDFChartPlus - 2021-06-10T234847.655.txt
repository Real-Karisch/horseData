 Footnotes
 GRADED ON A CURVE settled under rating just off the inside near the rear of the field behind the cover of MY PRIMO, tipped three wide through the far
 turn remaining patiently handled until angled five wide into upper stretch roused for the drive, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking
 command in the last jumps to prevail by a neck on the wire. JIMMY JAZZ four then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
 three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in under threat and was caught in the last jumps
 to the finish. WACKY PAL broke out a step at the start getting bumped by MY PRIMO before brushing with APPOINTMENT, established the front and
 showed the way in hand just off the inside through sensible splits, came under increasing pressure through the far turn and was placed to coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and got collared a furlong out, weakened in the late stages while safe for the show
 honors. OVERLORD chased along the inside growing detached at the tail of the field early on, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide
 into upper stretch and kept on through the drive to improve position to the finish. MY PRIMO broke in at the start bumping WACKY PAL, then got pinched
 back lightly between foes, tracked the pace just off the inside before tucking inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went two to
 three wide at the quarter pole and offered no response. ALPHALFA four paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked two to three wide
 through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths advancing briefly, swung four wide for home and weakened. APPOINTMENT three then two
 wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, faded through the far turn and went four wide at the quarter pole before
 tiring in the stretch.

 DISCRETIONARY MARQ established the front and showed the way three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path
 through the turn under pressure to the inside from ALL SYSTEMS GO, spun just off the inside for home roused for the stretch drive, shook away briefly
 before being confronted by the runner up, dug in dueling through to the finish and gamely fended off that rival to prevail. BANANA THIEF chased three then
 two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied to knock heads through the final eighth with the aforementioned foe
 fighting gamely to the finish but was ultimately fended off and denied. LONHTWIST tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear coming under
 coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three for home, rallied willingly altering in a path a sixteenth out to latch on the top pair as they hit the finish.
 MUTAKATIF (IRE) hit the near side stall at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, offered
 up a mild bid but was outkicked. ALL SYSTEMS GO hit the near side stall at the start, advanced to press the pace from the two path before tucking inside
 through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in the late stages. COLONEL TOM chased two to
 three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. SHIRAZ chased three to four wide under coaxing from the

 Footnotes
 MY FIRST GAL coaxed from the gate, showed the way just off the inside lightly coaxed along, tucked inside half a mile from home, cut the corner roused
 into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. MZ SEB PAT chased along the inside from just off the pace,
 came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. FUSI just off the inside in
 pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the show honors.
 HONORABLE PROFIT three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and offered up a mild kick.
 YOUTH GONE WILD chased two to three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was
 outkicked. SEATTLE FROST fractious in the gate, got away to an awkward start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, cut the
 corner into upper stretch and passed tired foes. DADDYSNEVERREADY chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four
 wide for home, made no impact. CHARMING CARA chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, tired.
 GUNBOAT DIPLOMACY chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide
 for home and offered no response. FUNDERELLA four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
 stretch, made no impact. ANGELS AND US fractious in the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole and was never a factor.
