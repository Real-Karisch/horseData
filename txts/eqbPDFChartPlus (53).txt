 on the turn, in the stretch and failed to rally. ARBUTUS chased the pace three wide around the turn and gave way in upper stretch. FINE N DANCY ,
 unhurried down the backstretch, was five deep entering the stretch and failed to be a factor. CHERISHED PRIZE was outrun. PENSY MOLL trailed.

 Footnotes
 NO MORE TALK , keen to clear leaving the three quarter pole, was nicely rated setting the pace towards the inside, moved away around the turn, was
 under strong handling through the final three sixteenths and held sway. JUMP JIVE AN WAIL , patiently handled while saving ground well off the early pace,
 eased out mid turn, edged up behind foes while still under some rating leaving the five sixteenths, shifted out five wide and was put to a drive nearing the
 three sixteenths and leveled off nicely to gain. DON'T POKE THE CAT , taken to rate while saving ground, came under pressure mid turn, cut the corner
 making some progress into the lane but failed to seriously sustain in the final seventy yards. BO VUK , bumped and then stumbled at the break, recovered
 and was far back early on, was put to pressure wide into the far turn, circled five wide into the lane and made a mild run. PAUL THE WAITER , four wide
 stalking the pace, was asked to pick up the pace into the lane, lacked a solid punch and faded in the final furlong. POSTERITY settled in the clear past the
 five eighths but lacked a rally. UNO DANCER , bumped at the break, advanced towards the rail nearing the half mile marker and reached a stalking spot,
 was under a drive two wide mid turn and weakened. STORM NET was steadied back from between rivals leaving the gate, drafted well off the early pace,
 came wide for the drive but lacked a kick. RED CLAY ROAD broke inward and bumped a rival, rushed up to contention leaving the chute, prompted the
 winner into the turn then faltered.

 Footnotes
 SONNY INSPIRED broke sharply then was angled outside JOHN JONES leaving the chute, stalked that one while in about the three path, came under
 strong urging to keep pace mid turn, ranged up four wide to threaten soon into the lane, dueled, gained a slim lead a furlong out, kept on tenaciously under
 stern handling and held firm. JOHN JONES was sent clear soon after the break then relaxed leaving the chute, set a rated pace just off the inside, spun
 three wide into the lane, dug in when confronted, maintained a narrow lead past the three sixteenths, continued valiantly to the inside of the winner but just
 wasn't quite good enough. BELFOUR edged up between foes near the five eighths, was under a hustling ride two to three wide into the lane and finished
 willingly to gain. PHLASH PHELPS , four to five wide stalking the pace, was under pressure into the stretch but failed to generate a significant response.
 SARATOGA BOB , bumped at the break, lost ground five wide and failed to threaten. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH leaned in at the break and bumped with
 SARATOGA BOB, lagged well back while saving some ground, swung out in the drive and offered a slight kick. DOTHAT DANCE saved ground, was
 hustled up near the five eighths, chased to upper stretch and faded. JUST HOWARD , off the pace three wide, angled out in upper stretch and gave way.

 Footnotes
 CAIRENN exchanged several bumps with CEE BEE GEE BEE the opening furlong, worked between horses on the turn, angled to the three path turning for
 home, closed determinedly outside horses and was along late. TWEETING chased the pace outside ANGEL AT WAR, gained a short lead in mid stretch
 then gave way grudgingly. ANGEL AT WAR accelerated to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, lost the lead in mid stretch and faded in the drive.
 SQUAN'S KINGDOM circled the turn three wide, was four deep turning for home and lacked a rally in an even effort. CEE BEE GEE BEE exchanged
 bumps with the winner early, failed to be a factor and angled four wide turning for home. BARLEY JACK hugged the inner rail, chased the pace and gave
 way entering the stretch. MUNIFICENT chased the pace two wide, encountered some traffic entering the turn, gave way and was eased.

 Footnotes
 OLD TIME REVIVAL came away in good order then relaxed kindly off the rail and in range of a hotly contested early pace, responded when given his cue
 past the five sixteenths and set his sights on PERFECT COVER, kept on doggedly under left handed rousing through the final furlong and just got up.
 PERFECT COVER dueled outside UNION BLUES while under some rating, put away that one nearing the five sixteenths and edged away a bit entering the
 lane, drifted in under a drive leaving the furlong marker, switched to his correct lead a sixteenth out, continued on in game fashion but was nipped at the
 line. TOUR DE FORCE stalked to the inside of a rival, angled out mid turn and came four wide for the drive, gave hard chase to the wire and finished with
 interest. GLORY STARS settled in the clear early on, was asked for run past the three eighths, circled seven wide making some headway into the lane,
 wandered outward past the three sixteenths, was soon corrected but flattened out late. ROCKINN ON BYE lagged far back, came four wide for the drive
 and had belated action. TOP OF MIND lagged while racing to the inside of a rival, angled out for the drive but failed to muster up a run. FLASH MCCAUL
 was outrun. HONOR THE FLEET hopped slightly at the break, moved up nearing the three quarter pole and reached a stalking spot off the rail, failed to kick
 on past the five sixteenths and weakened. UNION BLUES rushed up inside leaving the chute and gained a short lead, was hounded by PERFECT COVER,
 ceded to that one nearing the three eighths, stayed on to about the quarter pole then gave way.

 Footnotes
 DOCTOR MOUNTY , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace under patient handling, moved up three deep on the far turn, was fanned four wide entering
 the stretch, gained the lead near three sixteenths pole and dug in tenaciously under rousing and narrowly prevailed. PROJECTED (GB) , two wide the first
 turn, was rated down the backstretch, worked between horses the far turn, entered the stretch three wide while attempting to get in a bit then responded to
 brisk left hand urging to gamely close inside the winner. IRISH STRAIT , two wide between horses entering the far turn, checked on the heels of a tiring
 SIEM RIEP near the three eighths pole, was angled in approaching the stretch, raced in the two path through the stretch and rallied gamely. DALARNA ,
 along the rail on the far turn, angled to the three path at the head of the stretch, drifted back to the rail in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong.
 ABIDING STAR , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and tired in the drive. O DIONYSUS was outrun. SIEM
 RIEP chased the pace outside ABIDING STAR, was done mid way on the far turn and faltered.

 Footnotes
 CHANNEL CAT tracked the pace under rating and to the outside of a rival, edged closer past the five eighths, went on the attack and overwhelmed the
 leader leaving the three eighths pole, moved clear and dropped in under an aggressive ride leaving the five sixteenths, kept on under stout handling past the
 furlong grounds and held firm. ADMISSION OFFICE settled well off the early pace, took closer order while under coaxing nearing the half mile marker, came
 off the inside with some momentum into the stretch, drifted out briefly near the three sixteenths, corrected to give willing pursuit but was simply no match for
 the winner. NAKAMURA , unhurried early while well off the inside, advanced four wide into the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch but one paced through
 the final furlong. NEEPAWA cleared early, set the early pace off the inside, dropped in towards the fence nearing the three quarter pole, failed to resist the
 winner's charge leaving the far turn, shifted out and pursued four wide into the lane, drifted in near the three sixteenths then steadied when in close, failed to
 recover and gave way. JAILHOUSE KITTEN saved ground off the early pace, angled out for the backstretch run, gained four wide leaving the far turn, failed
 to keep pace entering the lane and weakened. PEACE OF EKATI , four wide stalking the early pace, angled in past the three quarter pole, took closer order
 into the far turn, failed to quicken past the five sixteenths and faltered. QUEEN OF CONNAUGHT (GB) , rank early on while saving some ground and
 stalking the pace, shifted out leaving the three quarter pole, failed to kick on under pressure past the five eighths and faltered. An objection by the rider of
 NEEPAWA against the winner for alleged interference around the final turn was not allowed. Also, an objection by the rider against ADMISSION OFFICE for
 alleged interference in upper stretch was not allowed.

 through the stretch. SAINT MAIN EVENT , angled in leaving the backstretch, raced along the inner rail the final five furlongs and finished willingly. IRISH

 floated to the five path in upper stretch and weakened. BEYOND FOREVER raced between horses on the turn and failed to rally. PROUD MAID MARIAN ,
 done leaving the backstretch, steadily retreated. CAUGHT DREAM'N refused to break. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning CAUGHT DREAM'N at the

 ANGELINAS STAR prompted the pace two wide, cruised past the leader mid turn, spurted clear approaching the stretch, widened the advantage under
 strong encouragement leaving the eighth pole then held sway. LOUISE , three wide pursuing the leaders, closed steadily through the final furlong and was
 clearly second best. DREAMING OF DEWEY rushed clear, set the pace towards the rail, gave some resistance leaving the three eighths, chased the winner
 into the lane and faded in the final seventy yards. C V'S WILD CHILD , three to four wide, failed to menace. PRINCESS DONNA saved ground chasing the
 leaders and faded mid turn. PRINCESS KILLMAIN stumbled at the break, angled in early, swung five wide into the lane and came up empty.

 Footnotes
 MENACING , away in good order, drafted back off the leader while saving ground, was put to a solid drive mid turn, closed in towards the rail and under
 pressure three sixteenths out, quickly opened up with a furlong remaining then was kept to steady urging while widening late. SANDY LANE , in mid pack
 three to four wide, shifted in some through the drive and churned on willingly to gain the place. THE WALK , off the early pace, was sent up between
 runners leaving the far turn, dropped towards the rail in upper stretch and kept trying to the wire. TICKER TAPE PARADE cleared early, set a rated pace
 three wide into the lane, failed to resist the inside bid of the winner, wandered a bit and gave way through the final furlong. PRAISE THE MOON , three to
 four wide stalking the pace, was under pressure into the stretch and faded. SIDEWALK PROPHET failed to menace. THROW THE DEUCE , off the pace
 and removed from the rail, was under a ride four to five wide mid turn but failed to rally. WAR WINGS , urged along while removed from the rail, never
 threatened.
