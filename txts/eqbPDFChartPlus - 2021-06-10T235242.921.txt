 MEET ME HALF WAY chased DREAMY EYES from the three path into the stretch, drifted out a bit, made the lead approaching the furlong marker and
 finished full of run under mild urging to win as much the best. DREAMY EYES broke in front, set the pace until mid stretch then was no match for the winner.
 RAGS TO ROSES trailed into the turn, circled rivals three wide, dug in through the stretch and got up for third. SLOWERANDSLOWER with the second
 flight, three wide, lacked the needed response. FOREST GEM was through after a half. RINGIN IN THE RAIN inside, was through early.

 FLIRTY unhurried early, closed quickly two wide on the far turn, made the lead past the quarter pole, drifted out under left handed urging bumping the
 runner up multiple times and just held on in a stiff drive. BELLA DUDETTE hopped at the start, trailed for a half, closed rapidly three wide on the second
 turn, was bumped repeatedly through the stretch and just missed in a game effort. SUSPICION well placed, inherited the lead two wide on the far turn briefly
 then came up empty. SERKET chased the pace for nearly a half then stopped. TRUMP THAT broke in front, set the pace while a daylight lead into the far
 turn then stopped. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF BELLA DUDETTE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE

 PERFECT ELLA allowed to settle, circled horses in the five path on the second turn, made the lead near mid stretch and just lasted under strong handling.
 GRAN CHAMA stalked the pace from the three path for six furlongs, shifted out to the six path giving up some ground then dug in late, came on again and
 just missed getting up in time by the narrowest of margins. PATTY'S MISCHIEF unhurried early, finished with good courage in the four path. GOLFIN' DE
 AN chased the pace two wide into the far turn then weakened. SHIMMY was no factor. BROWN EYED LADY away alertly, set the pace along the inside to
 the quarter pole then stopped.

 Footnotes
 EKATI'S ICE broke in full stride to set all the pace while getting quick fractions and drew away under a hand ride. SMOOTH TALKIN TOM clipped heels with
 CHARLESTON PIER a few strides out of the gate, was allowed to settle, rallied determinedly in the six path through the stretch and finished well clear for
 second. HONOR ROLL unhurried early, had a mild late rally in the five path. CHARLESTON PIER angled out at the start causing SMOOTH TALKIN TOM to
 clip heels, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch then came up empty. VEYA no threat. ETHAN'S BOY was no factor. DANCING KING was through
 after a half.

 pace until mid stretch then weakened. SURELY DIMPLE failed to menace. DEKARDO swung wide and was no threat. OK KID well placed in the four path,
