 Footnotes
 MY BROTHER STEVE rushed into the far turn dueling abreast a pair of rivals, cleared at the quarter pole, angled towards the inside upper stretch, held firm
 under steady handling. BRILLIANT DUNCE showed good early speed vying for the early lead, passed by the winner at the quarter pole, gave chase in the
 lane finishing a willing second. MO SATIN settled in the second flight, hugged the rail entering the stretch, surged willingly grabbing third place in deep
 stretch. KID ORY raced up close from the start along the inside, pursued willingly needing a bit more. HERO'S WAGER settled in mid pack, mounted bid
 near the quarter pole, received left handed stick in the drive and drifted wide in mid stretch. POINTS IN INDY lacked early foot, drifted very wide in mid
 stretch under a drive missing a minor award. SEINE RIVER well placed from the start, hard ridden entering the stretch, failed to respond tiring in the lane.
 SINNER OR SAINT lacked speed, swung wide into the lane, drifted very wide in mid stretch losing ground, failed to factor. EVERGLIDE DRIVE raced in
 tight going into the far turn and clipped heels stumbling causing the rider to lose his irons, continued on to complete the course.

 Footnotes
 I'M IN TROUBLE quickly showed in front, led throughout traveling in the three path, won in hand crossing the finish line. SPEEDY ANALYSIS chased the
 winner around the turn, moved out to the five path in mid stretch, held place in a good effort. MISTERKAPLAN made a slight hop as the gate opened,
 rushed hard around the bend reaching contention, leveled off in mid stretch taking third place. NIAGARA BELLE trailed from the start, rallied along the
 inside from upper stretch, improved placing but was no real threat. SMOOCH MY INDY broke well stalking the winner, moved out seven wide in upper
 stretch giving chase, tired inside the eighth pole. SWAGGY settled towards the rear at mid track, roused to no avail, no factor. BELLA KRISTINA lacked
 speed, showed little. UAE NONSTOP flashed brief foot, gave way leaving the quarter pole and was vanned off after the race.

 Footnotes
 KIYA stalked to the quarter pole, angled four wide top of the lane taking aim, headed CHIHULY in mid stretch, slowly edged clear in deep stretch under
 strong handling. STURN DONNA trailed down the backstretch, advanced mid turn, split foes entering the stretch racing mid track, angled inside at the
 eighth pole, surged strongly grabbing second place in last jumps. CHIHULY pressed for the lead from the start, moved clear at the quarter pole, remained
 mid track in the stretch run, tired late being edged out of second place in last strides. HOLD BACK PATTI was hard used vying for the early lead, battled to
 upper stretch, weakened inside the furlong marker missing a minor share. CRYSTALS GOTAGUN settled in mid pack, failed to respond beating others.
 CLEARLY DREAMIN settled in the second flight, saved ground throughout, failed to threaten. MY MONKEY well placed stalking to the quarter pole, began
 to tire in upper stretch, no late factor. CITY TALE was a step slow leaving the gate, offered little. TELL IT INA MELODY faded mid turn to trail and was
 eased in upper stretch, finished the course and walked off.

 GIOVANTE well rated rallied on the far turn hooking the leader shaking clear in upper stretch holding firm under a drive in the four path. KODIAK MOON
 advanced on the backside giving chase on the far turn, extending near mid track down the lane came on for place. INDY WARS pressed the pace saving
 ground to upper stretch weakening along the rail. TRY ME AGAIN pressed the pace dueling through the far turn, would wear out in upper stretch fading in
 the three path. LOUIE'S HIGHWAY a step slow early saved ground to the far turn, roused to upper stretch would flatten out. DADS PARTY was always
 outrun.

 MIDNIGHT TALE hustled leaving the gate, led throughout traveling in the three path, was kept to task holding safe to the wire. ZOEY D showed good early
 speed, stalked running at mid track, gained place late in a game try. BOB'S MISTRESS chased the winner from the start, loomed entering the stretch, was
 out finished late losing second place. FLATLINER trailed early on, went by one weary foe in upper stretch but never menaced. DANCIN IN THE SOUP
 raced evenly at mid track, roused to no avail and weakened leaving the quarter pole.
