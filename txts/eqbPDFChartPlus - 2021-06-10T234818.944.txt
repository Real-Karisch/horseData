 INDIAN POWER was bumped at the break, opened a clear lead soon after, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with
 complete authority. LEHIGH chased the winner while racing three-wide throughout but could not gain on that rival in the drive. SEATTLE SEA GAL was
 away in good order then forwardly placed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. KISSES FOR TONKAA was bumped at the
 start, showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and was not a factor. APRILS NOT FOOLIN was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced
 four-wide through the first turn, moved five-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the quarter and did not reach contention. RENATITANON was
 bumped at the start, showed brief speed from between foes, was eased through the stretch, pulled up late and walked off.

 Footnotes
 HOODY broke sharply to stalk the pace of RALLYING MARKET while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and
 steadily drew off. RALLYING MARKET was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with PAKOKOHE, opened a clear margin nearing the
 nine-sixteenths pole, remained in control and gave way to the winner after going six furlongs. EDDINGTON'S STAR was void of early speed, raced
 four-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. BLACKFORD raced four-wide through the first turn, moved five-wide through the second
 turn and did not reach contention. PAKOKOHE disputed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and weakened.

 PHILLY BABY broke in, set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority.
 BELLASTIME was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive and was unsaddled on
 the back-stretch and vanned off. FAITH FLYS AGAIN was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, veered in
 with a furlong to run, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good courage when clear. BELLA MIA broke in, was forwardly placed from the
 inside throughout and lacked the needed late response. SHOPPING TIZZY was pushed in at the start, settled off the leaders early, saved ground through
 the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not menace. C I M SWEET was fractious at the post, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did
 not menace. PER LA BELLA showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid. CAPPUCCINO
 TIME lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

 Footnotes
 DAYTONA BEACH broke sharply to press the pace of CREDIT LINE while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
 drifted out nearing the quarter, vied through a prolonged drive and edged away late. CREDIT LINE set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when
 challenged by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way grudgingly to that foe through a hard drive. PICK BY THE BOX was void of
 early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, moved up for a contending position in mid-stretch and held on well to save the show. STRAIGHT BOURBON
 was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. TROOP SHIP raced off the pacesetters early,
 moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. TRELAWNY settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.
 DYNAMO DIXIE hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 THORNINMYSIDE settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter, reached GOLD N GREEN inside the
 furlong marker and edged away in the drive. GOLD N GREEN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further
 approaching the stretch, gained command with a quarter to run but could not match strides with the winner in the drive. CRUISER BLUE was away in good
 order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, checked while retreating nearing the sixteenth pole and continued to give way. BANQUE DRAUGHT was
 bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. TOUCH OF EINSTEIN settled off the leaders
 early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LUCKY G A was bumped at the break, disputed the pace from between foes for a half and
 gave way. DANCING PISTOL lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. FLATTER CAT was void of early speed, raced four-wide
 through the turn and was not a factor. CLEAN SWEEP DOWN was bumped at the start, vied for the lead from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.
