 Footnotes
 ANGELNAULE was unhurried into the far turn while in the three path then the two path through the turn, angled four wide entering the lane, dueled with the
 runner-up outside the eighth pole then edged clear late. GOOD GUESS tracked the pace while along the inside, angled three wide when gaining momentum
 and entering the lane, inched to a short lead with a furlong to go then could not hold the winner safe. HOOSIER MAIDEN stumbled to her knees at the start
 spotting the field about four lengths, hustled up into the first turn while in the four path, moved to vie for the lead entering the backstretch, dueled for the top
 spot into the lane then yielded to the top two while running on to save the show spot. CORA ANNE vied for the lead along the inside, gained the lead in late
 turn then gave way after straightening in the lane. LILY IS FAST chased the pace from the three path through the far turn then lacked a response in the
 lane.

 Footnotes
 HOLIDAY BID was away alertly to gain the lead at once, raced in the two path when clearing in mid-turn, was under pressure entering the lane from near
 the rail, continued with a short lead inside the eighth pole and held on in a game effort. WAR BALLAD chased the pace from the three path through the turn,
 swung into the lane from the five path and three wide, continued on determinedly late and just missed. BOWERY BABY chased the pace from the three
 path into late turn, bid two wide into the lane and loomed a serious threat when straightening, continued on in close proximity into deep stretch and just
 needed more`. QUEEN OF CREED tracked the pace from along the inside through the turn, bid into the lane, slowly gaining from along the rail inside the
 eighth pole, was blocked inside the last seventy yards and could not persevere. TAPIZ DREAM chased the pace from the three or four path through the turn
 and into the lane and was never a serious threat. HASSLE steadily faded while in the two or three path through the turn.

 FATHER BUD chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, launched a bid after straightening, steadily gained
 on the dueling leaders through the lane and edged clear late. TWO IF BY SEA was bumped at the start, moved to duel with another through the turn and
 into the lane, was inching past that one inside the sixteenth pole then was passed by the winner late. THATS MYBUDDY BOY set the pace early, was
 joined by another before entering the turn, dueled with that one into deep stretch then yielded. CAVALEIRO chased the pace from the three path, was put
 under a drive near the five-sixteenths pole, continued under strong handling through the lane but lacked the needed response. RENN LAKE was in the three
 path through the turn and moved up while not a threat. GIGGITY was never a factor while near the inside. BISCUITS N GRAVY was outrun while near the
 rail. WEEKEND SPECIAL chased the pace while along the inside into the turn then steadily faded.

 TIZAGO sprinted clear at once, widened through the turn, continued with a clear advantage into the lane then was kept under a strong drive to maintain the
 diminishing advantage. DANCE HALL DOLL chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and steadily gained
 through the final eighth but ran out of real-estate. LOVE BROKE THRU raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from mid-track and slowly
 gained to the end. LIL SUCRETTE was in the three path through the turn and offered a mild gain through the final eighth while never a threat. GINORMOUS
 was never a factor near the inside. SNAPASELFIE was outrun while racing from near the rail to the three path through the turn. CLASSY LADY chased the
 winner into the turn, began dropping back after mid-turn then continued to retreat and was eased to the wire and walked off.

 SMOOTH BOB was clear early, was challenged on the turn, then rebroke at the quarter pole and drew off under steady urging. STRINGTOWN was jostled
 at the start, bid late inside and was the best of the rest. CAIMAN CONQUERED stalked the pace in the two path, then had no late bid. SURE PRIZE saved
 ground to no avail. AUCTION LIGHT was squeezed back at the start, then passed tired foes. KID MANGO saved ground to no avail. LUCKY GIANT
 pressed the pace in the three path, then faded in the drive. GIBSONS TRICKY BOY showed brief speed in the three path before fading.
