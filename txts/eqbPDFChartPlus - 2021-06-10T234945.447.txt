 BOBBY MAGIC stalked the leaders while racing five-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, drifted out and drew off with complete authority.
 FORMAL JOKER broke sharply then was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive
 but finished with a steady bid. TRELAWNY set a pressured pace from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. ASK NOT bobbled at the start,
 chased the leaders from the inside and gradually gave way. RYAN WALT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to threaten.
 BLACKFORD was off slow and lagged throughout.

 Footnotes
 LANSKY pressed the pace of BATTLE POINT RED from the inside, moved up to take command inside the quarter, quickly opened a clear margin and held
 sway to the wire. TIZ MANNY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished
 with a steady bid. BATTLE POINT RED was off a step slow, rushed to the lead, raced three-wide while setting the pressured pace, gave way to the winner
 after going a half and stayed on in the drive to hold the show. WHY NOT US showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out
 approaching the stretch and finished with some late run. SHERM lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ZIPPIN WINE
 hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. GOLDSLINGER showed brief speed, weakened and
 was eased through the lane.

 Footnotes
 FORTUNE'S FREUDE was away in good order to be reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth
 to run and edged away late. SPOT ON broke sharply to stalk the pace of HOLD THAT SMILE while racing four-wide, could not match strides with her
 stable-mate late but finished with good courage. HOLD THAT SMILE opened a clear lead soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace,
 remained in control through mid-stretch but could not hold the winner safe through the final yards. BEAU ROCKS showed no early speed, raced five-wide
 through the turn and finished with some late run. SUGARSEEKER settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SHE
 GOT AWAY raced just off the leaders early, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and did not offer a bid thereafter. DAKOTA'S TANGO chased the
 leaders from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.

 Footnotes
 DOCKTARRI was reserved just off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, waited for racing room nearing the quarter, angled out nearing the
 three-sixteenths pole and was up in time. U NOMUTT was allowed to settle early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths
 pole, rallied late and just missed. DEVIL DOG was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and finished willingly in the drive. JOHNNY FIVE raced
 unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with some late run. FRENCH CANDY stalked the leaders while
 racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear lead and gave way through the final sixteenth. I WORK FOR CARROTS
 broke slow and awkward, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MISTER G. Q. sprinted clear at once, saved
 ground while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. UP STREAM was off slow, lagged throughout and was eased through the lane.
