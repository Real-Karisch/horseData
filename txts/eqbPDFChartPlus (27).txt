 forced outward at the start, was kept close from outside, advanced four wide on the turn, also angled in some leaving the bend, came to SKIRT WARNING
 upper stretch, gradually wore down inside the last furlong but was clearly second best. WHEW in contention early just off the inside, gradually angled out
 through the turn, came four wide into the lane, gained third midstretch then could only hold her position late. PEARL OF LAREDO was soon well back,
 picked up her pace from inside leaving the turn and angled out twice through the stretch as she gradually closed the gap on the leaders. ONE HOTDISH
 broke a step slow and outward at the start, bumped KAMOTE LU, quickly recovered to duel for the lead from inside but began to tire with a quarter mile to
 go. KAMOTE LU hesitated then made a slight leap from the gate, was bumped, hustled up to contest the pace outside ONE HOTDISH but gave way after
 two and a half furlongs.

 Footnotes
 SPECTACTICAL soon had a clear lead, was challenged from outside after travelling the first furlong, had the rail through the turn, dug in under a steady
 drive in the lane and kept AT IT EARLY at bay. AT IT EARLY engaged SPECTACTICAL from outside after the first eighth, fought gamely through the
 stretch, did not have enough late but proved easily second best. GO ON DANGEROUS hesitated at the break, was hustled up from between horses to
 press the early pacesetters, stayed in path three through the bend, was no match for the top pair when set down for the drive but gradually drew away from
 the rest. DEPUTY WALKER was an early factor between rivals, just off the inside taking the turn and ran evenly through the stretch. POPSEE was a
 contender from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up but improved position four wide on the turn and had no late bid. N C C JACK stumbled at the
 break, was also a factor while toward the outside on the backstretch but faded three wide on the turn and ran evenly the last quarter mile. GOSPEL
 MOTOVATION also stumbled at the start, retreated from tight quarters with a quarter mile to go, angled in on the turn and had no stretch bid. PUNCHING
 WILDLY tried to bear in at the break, was checked, bore out on the backstretch, running greenly, was kept in hand to the turn and lacked a significant
 response under a drive through the lane. GOLDEN GUN also hesitated at the start, was hustled up from inside to be a factor from inside but gave way into
 the turn.

 PERFECT TO PLEASE was kept close from between horses, went for the lead three wide on the second turn, edged ahead upper stretch and held on
 under steady handling. BELLARMINE shared the early lead just off the rail but inside rivals, took the rail on the second bend and edged ahead, lost the
 advantage upper stretch, never relented but had to settle for second best in a game effort. SOCIAL MISFIT was away slowly, moved to the outside on the
 first turn and was kept close, angled in to be just off the inside entering the second bend, altered out four wide at the top of the stretch, made a strong move
 the final furlong, came up short but caught TUFF KID for third. TUFF KID forwardly placed between horses, lost ground four wide taking the second turn,
 gained third midstretch, closed belatedly and was outfinished for the show. ROCKET JOE COPPER displayed early speed outside BELLARMINE but
 flattened out through the lane. ELITCH was an early factor from inside but began to tire after five furlongs.

 RODEO ROSIE, advanced from outside, went for the lead three wide on the second turn, took the lead into the lane, moved clear inside the last furlong but
 was outfinished. RODEO ROSIE crowded at the start, soon set a pressured pace from between rivals, lost the advantage while two wide on the second
 bend and gradually wore down through the stretch. CROSSINGTHERUBICON soon trailed, chased from off the rail, advanced from inside on the second
 turn, angled out leaving that bend, came into the lane from path five, drifted out inside the last eighth, was corrected and improved position. ANGEL OF
 DREAMS broke outward, bumping VALENTINE NIGHT, was prominent from inside, advanced along the rail on the second turn but began to tire leaving that
 bend. KECOCA raced in contention between horses, was just off the rail on the second turn, also swung out leaving that bend, came widest into the stretch
 and gave way. VALENTINE NIGHT bumped from the rear at the start, vied for the lead inside RODEO ROSIE to the last quarter mile then also gave way.

 ALL BEHROOZED UP without early speed, angled out to advanced on the bend, came into the stretch five wide, made a strong move the last eighth and
 caught TIMELY REPLY in the waning yards. TIMELY REPLY progressed from inside on the turn, squeezed through inside BEACH FIRE after entering the
 last furlong to gain a narrow advantage with a sixteenth left but was outfinished. MAGNETO squeezed between rivals just after the break, advanced three
 wide on the turn, fanned out further for the drive and found best stride too late. BLUECOLLARMAN was a step slow at the break, trailed, swung out widest
 into the turn, came into the stretch six wide, made a strong move the final furlong but was also too late. BEACH FIRE was sent to get the early lead, saved
 ground, came off the rail slightly for the stretch run, began to wear down inside the final eighth, brushed as TIMELY REPLY advanced inside him and slowly
 yielded. K STREET without early speed from outside, improved position three wide on the bend and also closed well deep stretch. PHELPS bumped with
 MAGNETO just after the start, pressed from outside, was two wide on the turn, floated out some entering the stretch and gradually wore down in the late
 going. DEFENDER OF HEARTS also bumped with MAGNETO just after the break, displayed early speed between rivals but quit after two and a half
 furlongs, was eased the last eighth and walked off.

 FREE MUSIC bumped with GOINGTOGIVE'EMHALE at the start, shared the lead outside THREE WILD RUMORS, moved clear upper stretch, drifted out
 late but held on. MIDE raced in contention toward the outside from the beginning, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive, rallied the
 last furlong but was too late. LINDA'S VICTORY forwardly placed in the second flight, went for the lead three wide on the bend but gradually wore down for
 the stretch run. BATTLE ADMIRAL without early speed, was four wide through the turn, lodged a mild bid into the lane, improved position upper stretch then
 could only make up minor ground the last furlong. DANNY PAYCHECK hesitated then bobbled at the break, picked up his pace four wide on the turn, swung
 out further for a clear path into the stretch and steadily improved position without threatening. PAINTED LEGACY was a factor between rivals for three
 furlongs but flattened out for the drive. JACK BE COOKIN also bumped with GOINGTOGIVE'EMHALE at the start, raced in contention on the backstretch
 but gave way along the rail on the bend. THREE WILD RUMORS displayed early speed from inside, floated out some leaving the turn and tired.
 GOINGTOGIVE'EMHALE bumped from both sides at the break, gave way from between foes early.

 EASY NIGHTS was a step slow at the break, chased from outside, commenced her bid three wide on the turn, altered out to path seven for racing room at
 the top of the lane, rallied under a drive and got up in time. JANES SHIP in the second flight from outside on the backstretch, advanced five wide on the
 bend, gradually lugged in after entering the last furlong, had the lead seventy yards out but was outfinished. ECO STAR contested the pace between rivals,
 was three wide through the bend, gained the advantage nearing the furlong marker, battled between foes, crowded briefly inside the final sixteenth, slowly
 yielded and was altered out nearing the wire. BROADWAY STICKER vied for the early lead from inside, dueled through the lane and gradually wore down
 deep stretch. NASTY LUCY shared the lead from outside on the backstretch, was four wide on the bend and slowly yielded from between horses the last
 quarter mile. EMERALD POINT chased from just off the inside, altered out eight wide at the top of stretch and rallied belatedly. LABELHERMYPRAYER
 prominent between horses, was just off the inside on the bend, altered out six wide at the top of the lane for a clear path and lacked the needed late kick.
 SHEZA PRIZE raced in contention from inside for a half mile then gradually yielded. CONNORS GAL soon trailed from between horses, angled to the
 outside on the bend, moved out widest midstretch and made up minor ground without threatening. I HOPE displayed early speed between foes, was two
 wide leaving the bend then quickly gave way inside the last quarter mile. There was a stewards' inquiry into the run through the deep stretch but no action
 was taken after their review.

 GONE AWRY broke well but was soon chasing from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, fanned out further for the stretch run, lugged in some as
 she took the lead nearing the sixteenth marker and just lasted. CANDY LINE forwardly placed between horses, did not keep up on the turn, took the rail
 leaving the bend, gradually altered out midstretch to gain a clear path four wide, closed well but had to settle for second best. SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
 showed first, contested the pace from outside, was two wide taking the turn, battled in the lane but gradually wore down inside the last eighth. CRAYON
 disputed the early pace from inside rivals, had the rail through the bend, fought in the stretch but also lacked the extra needed the final furlong. SOONER
 SURPRISE prominent between horses on the backstretch, faded from inside on the bend. SHIP SHAPE MISS away slowly, rushed up to be a brief factor,
 did not stay close going to the turn, angled out some into the bend, swung outside SOONER SURPRISE into the stretch and improved position without
 threatening. MILLE BACI chased in midpack, was three to five wide through the turn and had no late bid. CALEBS PROMISE pressed the early pacesetters,
 stayed in path three through the bend and tired the last quarter mile. J W HALF MOON was a step slow at the break, advanced four wide on the bend,
 fanned out further for the stretch run and lacked a rally. CRYSTAL CODE bore out at the start, bumped solidly with SUNSET DREAMER, bobbled,
 recovered to be a factor from inside on the backstretch but gave way on the bend. SUNSET DREAMER bumped solidly from both sides at the break,
 stumbled and was never a factor. TWICE AS TALL was reluctant to load, broke inward, also bumping solidly with SUNSET DREAMER, was forced outward
 then showed little.

 Footnotes
 BALANDEEN was kept close just off the inside, swung out leaving the turn, altered out further to stay clear of TOPOFTHEMOUNTAIN at the top of the lane,
 gradually closed in under a steady drive and swept past the latter in the waning yards. TOPOFTHEMOUNTAIN was away slowly then steadied briefly when
 his path was taken leaving the chute, altered out widest to advance on the backstretch, lost ground from path four on the bend, floated out further entering
 the stretch, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure as he took a narrow advantage with a furlong to go, was corrected but lugged in late under a
 right whip and was outfinished. HE'S SO ZAZZY vied for the early lead from outside, was in path three through the turn, fought between rivals in the lane,
 began to yield with a furlong to go and was bumped approaching the sixteenth marker. WELDER disputed the pace off the rail but inside rivals, dueled
 through the lane, also began to yield with a furlong left, drifted out some under left-handed pressure approaching the sixteenth pole, bumped HE'S SO
 ZAZZY and continued to slowly wear down. HOLD FOR MORE moved to the inside shortly after the start, raced in contention for a half mile then flattened
 out.

 Footnotes
 LATENT RIVER shared the early lead from inside, moved ahead when allowed on the turn, was roused leaving the bend, drew clear in the stretch and was
 kept to a drive until the final seventy yards. IDABOSSOFU broke in stride but then allowed to settle back, was three wide on the turn, lost further ground
 fanning to path five into the lane, altered outside INHERENT RISK upper stretch, made a strong move the final furlong and caught the latter for second.
 INHERENT RISK chased from far off the inside on the backstretch, angled in as he commenced his bid five wide into the bend, was bumped entering the
 lane, steadily advanced, rallied inside the last furlong to gain second late between horses but was outfinished for the place. WINDMILL MAN pressed the
 pace from outside, angled in beside LATENT RIVER leaving the turn, drifted out some upper stretch, could not stay with the latter and slowly wore down in
 the late going. LAST YOUNG THING chased from between horses, progressed four wide on the bend, was caught in tight quarters leaving the bend and
 bumped with INHERENT RISK, improved position upper stretch then leveled off. EURO GREEN prominent from inside, angled out some on the bend, was
 three wide leaving the turn, began to wear down, brushed with LAST YOUNG THING into the lane and continued to yield. G MAN IS IN TOWN displayed
 early speed between rivals but began to tire two wide midway on the bend. HADDLE DADDLE steadily faded from between horses early on.
