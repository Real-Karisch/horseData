 DAMISELA bid three wide on the turn, led into the stretch, bore out racing an erratic course but remained clear. FIDDLER lacked speed, moved closer on
 the turn, rallied inside the winner through the stretch. ZELICA lagged far behind, advanced inside into the stretch then split foes with good late energy.
 POLAR OPPOSITE forced the pace outside, collared the leader on the turn but proved empty in the stretch. FEDERAL INDICTMENT ducked out at the
 start, chased wide and was never a factor. JEALOUS HEART hustled to the front inside, lost the advantage midway on the turn and gave way.

 AWESOME ANTHONY lacked speed, advanced inside, angled out rallying into the lane and prevailed following a long drive. LET HIM SHINE set the pace
 inside, was collared into the stretch and held on tenaciously while second best. HANGTIME settled off the pace inside and continued well while no threat.
 MISSED HIM dropped far behind outside and moved wide through the stretch. PONTE VEDRA SKY fractious in the gate prior to the start, stalked the pace
 and faded. PAUL'S PETION dropped back early and was never in contention. SOMETHING QUINTO forced the pace outside for three quarters and
 stopped. WILLIE WEARS PINK chased wide and gave way readily. A claim of foul by the second place finisher against the winner for interference in the
 stretch was dismissed.

 WORLD CHANGER settled far behind for half a mile, rallied five wide into the stretch, offered a late surge to get up in time. GAME BREAKER urged close
 up outside, bid after three quarters, loomed boldly in the stretch but was outfinished. JOEY CAP lagged well behind to the stretch then finished full of run too
 late. RESURRECTION BAY set a pressured pace to mid-stretch then weakened. SPEIGHTSHILL chased inside off the pace, moved outside on the final
 turn then flattened out in the stretch. MEMORIES OF WINTER forced the pace outside for six furlongs then faded in the stretch.
