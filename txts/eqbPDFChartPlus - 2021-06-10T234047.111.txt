 Footnotes
 DIAMONDINTHECENTER sped to the early lead off the rail, dueled outside a rival, took a short lead leaving the turn, inched away into the stretch and drew
 clear under urging. CHAYBABY chased off the rail then outside a rival into and on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and gained the place. SABURAI
 stalked a bit off the rail then inside on the turn, came out into the stretch, was between horses through much of the final furlong and edged foes for the
 show. MANNERLY went up inside to duel for the lead, fought back on the turn and weakened but was edged for third. DEMIGODDESS unhurried a bit off
 the rail to the stretch, came out some in the drive and put in a late bid at a minor award three deep on the line.
