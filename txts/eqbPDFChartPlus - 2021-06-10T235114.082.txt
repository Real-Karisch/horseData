 Footnotes
 DAKOTA CHROME leaned into the side of the gate but quickly recovered to duel on the lead outside REIGN ON, continued with that one through the lane
 and kept safe to the wire. REIGN ON appeared to be trying to get out into the turn while dueling inside the winner, came out into the lane, continued to duel
 but came up short. SORTA MINE was along the inside to midway of the turn, angled four wide nearing the lane but had no rally. BOCKSCAR ENOLAGAY
 was not a threat racing three wide. AMERICAN SAVVY was not a factor. YUKON GOLD trailed.

 Footnotes
 CHASE MY SHADOW tracked the early leader from three wide to bid into the far turn, wore that one down through that bend to edge clear and moved off
 under steady handling. BLUFF'S BACK angled three wide heading up the backstretch, continued evenly in the lane and gained the place through the final
 yards. EL PRIETO made the pace from the two path to the far turn and had little left into the lane. ELTACOGUAPO failed to mount a bid racing three wide.
 STORMY ALBERT chased the early leaders from three or four wide and tired. OUTLAW'S GAME floated out to be six wide in the first turn and soon gave
 way.

 and was slowly edging clear late. LEE'S TOUGH GUY moved to a short lead racing about the two or three path, made the pace to the far turn, resisted the
 winner but could not last. HELLO TIZ steadied off heels into the first turn from inside LEE'S TOUGH GUY, continued to stalk from along the inside and
 lacked a final closing run. REGAL RIVAL was always back racing four wide. GREEN MOON RISING stalked the leaders from three wide and tired. LIL E B
 hesitated at the break and trailed throughout.

 winner late. TOTHRILLAROCKNBIRD settled along the inside just off the leaders and lacked a final closing bid. WHISKEY CHICK was on the pace from
 along the inside throughout and weakened late in the drive. AMERICAN MISFIT lacked a solid bid racing two to three wide. FLEET CAT FEET followed the
 pace from four wide and weakened. DEEDEES RISINGSTAR dropped back early, lost contact with the field and was pulled up going to the far turn and

 under steady handling. YODELIN' ANGEL made the pace racing about the two path, could not go with the winner but saved the place late. WILD DELILAH
 moved up four wide to bid into the far turn but could not sustain the move through the bend. MONGOL CALL was just off the pace racing three to four wide
 and lacked a final closing run. TSUNAMI GIRL stalked the leaders racing three to four wide in good position but weakened in the far turn. SANDRAUX
 lacked a rally racing four to five wide. KINAHORA prompted the early pace four wide outside rivals and tired.

 Footnotes
 BRONCO DAVE moved to a clear lead racing about the two or three path, shook off a bid from VIBRATO JAZZ in the far turn to edge clear again into the
 lane and drew off under steady handling. VIBRATO JAZZ stalked the pace from along the inside, bid in late backstretch, continued inside the winner into the
 lane and could not match strides late while saving position. SMART GALAXY was four to six wide through the first turn into the backstretch, moved up while
 angling in three wide on the far turn then went evenly in the lane to hold third. KITTY BLONDE stalked the pace in good position three wide and lacked a
 final closing bid. STARTINGOLD was crowded and shuffled back at the start to drop well off the pace and moved up four to five wide while not a threat.
 CRABBY FRANK moved up two or three wide in the far turn but could not seriously threaten late. LIL' APOLLO followed the pace from four wide and
 weakened. SOCIAL PRIZE was not a factor. BACK FROM AFRICA was in reach of the pace for a half and stopped suddenly nearing the lane.

 Footnotes
 LOTTO CAT settled off the early pace racing three and four wide through the opening half mile, rallied and reeled in the leaders heading up the backstretch
 to bid nearing the far turn, continued with COWBOY ACCENT into the lane, was lightly roused turning for home then drew off under a mild hand ride to the
 wire. COWBOY ACCENT dueled on the pace from inside BLACK LABEL through the opening six furlongs, was joined by the winner into the far turn,
 continued with that one into the lane but could not match strides late while well clear for the place. ROMAN'S CHANCE saved ground while off the early
 pace, angled four wide in the final turn while moving up then could not threaten late. TOBIN stalked the leaders racing three to four wide and had no rally.
 BLACK LABEL dueled on the early pace outside COWBOY ACCENT and tired in the far turn. TELL A FRIEND followed the pace from three wide and tired.
 BOOKOUT was always back. BLUEGALE stalked the early pace from four wide and tired.

 Footnotes
 QUEEN OF THE WALK stalked the pace from four wide while never far back, bid and moved clear into the lane then was noticeably tiring while holding
 clear to the wire. IMPEACHMENT'S ROSE was six wide through the first turn, settled three or four wide to move into contention, bid into the lane and could
 not run down the winner. SECRET FASCINATION made the early pace racing about the three path, continued to the final turn and had little left nearing the
 lane. ZIBBY DO saved ground in reach of the pace, moved up with a mild bid in the final turn but weakened into the lane. PARADISE ROAD followed the
 pace from four wide and weakened. FOG HAPPENS moved up inside to press the pace through the second turn to late backstretch and weakened. K C'S
 MISFIT was not a factor racing three wide. ALL SAID AND DONE trailed throughout.
