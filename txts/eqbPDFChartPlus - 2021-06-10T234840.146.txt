 Footnotes
 NUMBERS GAME opened clear to dictate terms, widened entering the lane, was kept to task and held. FAMILY LABEL advanced between horses, chased
 NUMBERS GAME to no avail, but stayed on fairly well to hold the place. TUPPENCE was close up along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch but
 failed to make headway. PROSE IN MOTION was allowed to settle, came five wide and finished with a mild improvement. SPRUCE RIDGE LADY was
 unhurried, angled out and finished with a belated gain. HEART SHAPED BOX contended five wide through the turn and tired. LOVE WILLIE LOVE showed
 little. HANG ON SLOOPY was forwardly placed between horses but stopped before going a half.

 hand, ranged up five wide to join the leaders leaving the second turn, kept on well but was unable to resist the winner. DOCTOR LEE attended the pace
 along the inside, shifted out between horses entering the stretch, but flattened and settled for the minor award. LOVELL tracked three wide, drew even after
 a half, opened clear on second turn, faltered entering the stretch. POLAR BEAR tucked in, moved up on the second turn, was bottled up in traffic and
 steadied near the quarter pole, found room but failed to sustain the drive. CASH THAT CHECK contended three wide through the second turn and tired.
 WILLIES WAR WAGON sent to the fore to set the pace, came up empty leaving the second turn and dropped out. ALMOST ROYALTY bobbled at the start,

 weakened in the stretch run. FOCUSED broke slowly, was bothered a bit in the backstretch and improved position down the lane. REHEARSED improved
 position. ICE ICE PRINCESS shifted into the three path in the turn, made a bid in the stretch but was empty late. DROSSY came out at the start, stalked the
 pace early, swung into the six path in the turn and faded late in the stretch drive. LIBERTY LADY was done early. TARA ROAD trailed the field throughout.
