 four wide on the turn, angled out and finished well to earn the place. MYHEARTSINTHECITY Tracked, dueled along the three path into the lane, battled
 three across a furlong out and finished willingly. MAJESTIC MALISSA Away best, set the pace along the two path, dueled into the lane, battled from
 between to no avail and then just missed the show. SWEET PEACHES Was well placed along the two path, three path into the lane and failed to respond.
 HALF DREAMIN broke sluggishly, in hand along the rail waiting into the turn, continued to wait behind rivals into the lane and then was blocked from the

 the rail, shook clear some and weakened. NONNIE CONNIE Vied for the lead from between to the lane and tired. ZEEKID Lagged back, three path on the
