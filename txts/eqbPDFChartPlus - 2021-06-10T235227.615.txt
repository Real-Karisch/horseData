 Footnotes
 ULTIMATE BANGO had good early speed and dueled inside, inched away a bit off the rail in midstretch, drifted out from the left handed whip in deep stretch
 and held on gamely. FIGHT ON stalked a bit off the rail then three deep a half mile out, fell back and angled in on the second turn, came out in the stretch
 and closed with a rush late. EXTRORDINARY JERRY angled in and dueled outside a rival then between foes into the second turn, stalked outside a rival on
 that turn, was between horses into the stretch and continued willingly. MAGIC MUSKETIER saved ground stalking the pace, came out for room in the
 stretch, steadied in tight off heels in deep stretch and was in tight again at the wire. EAST RAND chased inside then between horses on the backstretch,
 continued outside a rival on the second turn and three deep into the stretch and was outfinished. NOIVO (IRE) saved ground chasing the pace, moved up
 briskly between foes on the backstretch, bid three deep into the second turn then outside a foe, continued between horses in the stretch and was in tight off
 heels in deep stretch. SHADOW SPHINX stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail on the second turn, angled inward past midstretch and could not quite
 summon the necessary late kick. Following a stewards' inquiry and a claim of foul by the rider of MAGIC MUSKETIER against ULTIMATE BANGO, the latter
 was disqualified and placed fourth for interference in deep stretch.

 Footnotes
 LUCKY KNICKERS had speed off the rail then dueled outside a rival, inched away into the stretch and won clear under urging. GLEEFULY between horses
 early, stalked a bit off the rail, split horses in upper stretch and was clearly second best. SWEET CONGRATS stalked outside a rival then a bit off the rail,
 came three deep into the stretch and held third. BEYOND PLEASURE chased outside a rival then three deep leaving the hill and into the stretch and lacked
 the needed rally. SECOND FIDDLE went up inside to duel for the lead, fought back leaving the hill and weakened in the stretch. GRECIAN FORT settled
 outside a rival, came out three deep into the stretch and did not rally. EXES N OHS angled in and chased inside, cut the corner into the stretch and
 weakened. MONACO GIRL chased a bit off the rail then inside down the hill and into the stretch and also weakened. SOLAR GRACE settled outside a rival
 chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and lacked a further response. GAL OF THE CENTURY broke in and a step slowly, settled inside, came out into
 the stretch and was not a threat. Rail on hill at 14 feet.
