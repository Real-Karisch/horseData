 Footnotes
 AMERICAN RAISA was up close early, went five wide into the turn, was gaining late and was up in time for the win. DOUBLE DEHERE stalked the early
 pace, angled out three wide into the turn and finished second best. MISS AMADOR set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the turn and
 gave way. PRINCESS HERO was void of any early speed, raced four wide through the turn and offered no late rally. UR GRACE FINDS ME was unhurried
 early and was never a factor. THOU SHALT RULE broke out at the start and was never a threat.
