 SUNRISEBERNSTEINI , a forward factor in the two path down the backstretch, was lightly steadied behind rivals entering the far turn, swung to the four
 path leaving the turn, gained the lead approaching the eighth pole and narrowly prevailed. GOLD CADILLAC set the pace along the rail and gave way
 grudgingly. CLOVER BOTTOM prompted the pace outside GOLD CADILLAC and tired the final furlong. GOLDMAKESMESMILE , steadied in tight quarters
 along the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and failed to rally. CYCLICAL , four deep entering the first turn, was carried out by
 DOROTHY M approaching the half mile, angled in entering the turn and failed to be a factor. DOROTHY M swerved out approaching the half mile pole,
 circled the far turn three wide and weakened. INDIGO MIDNIGHT , eager early, drifted to the three path entering the first turn and dropped back on the far
 turn.

 NOTAPRADAPRICE , patiently handled while saving ground, edged closer into the far turn, awaited room near the quarter pole, responded when set down
 in upper stretch, bid inside the dueling leaders near mid stretch, took command soon after, spurted clear then was geared down in the final jumps. MORE
 FUN AGAIN settled off of a contested pace, took closer order between runners nearing the quarter pole, shifted out to be about five wide in upper stretch,
 finished up willingly and was able to gain the place late. NOT IN JEOPARDY tracked the duel three wide, bid past the quarter pole, battled on a slim lead
 outside rivals nearing mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. COME ON CITY (GER) dueled to the inside of TALKLESS SMILEMORE, shook clear past the
 five sixteenths, was engaged from her outside soon into the lane, fought between rivals heading to the eighth pole then faded. LE WEEKEND , unprepared
 at the break and was away slowly, steadied soon after, angled out and moved up four wide nearing the five eighths, raced in range to the three eighths then
 had nothing left to seriously give. TALKLESS SMILEMORE vied outside a rival, failed to keep pace under a ride into the lane and retreated.

 PIZMO TIME stalked inside, edged closer under coaxing past the five sixteenths, angled out soon into the lane, made a grinding run under left handed
 encouragement, reeled in the leader leaving the sixteenth marker and forged ahead in the final yards. ARCHAGGELOS cleared early, set the pace two wide
 into the lane, switched to his left lead in mid stretch, drifted in briefly then was corrected and battled gamely to the line. SUE ME , four wide in range nearing
 the half mile marker, swung wider under pressure in upper stretch and finished with interest to nab the show. ENGLISH MINISTER , three wide stalking the
 pace, angled four to five wide in upper stretch and flattened out. CHARGIN STORM stalked two wide, was under pressure three wide chasing into the lane,
 shifted in and faded. NIMS , in close at the break, settled off the pace, circled four to five wide into the lane and lacked a solid kick. MOONLIGHT SHADOW
 settled outside a rival early on, was under a ride three wide into the stretch but failed to menace. BLUE RIDGE SCOUT saved ground and faded. BARNEY
 REBEL (IRE) bobbled at the break, lagged off the pace, came three to four wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.
