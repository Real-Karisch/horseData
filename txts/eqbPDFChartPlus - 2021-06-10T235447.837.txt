 STUCCO stalked the pace racing near the rail, eased out leaving the turn, gained the lead approaching the eighth pole and dug in late to narrowly prevail.
 MARDEN , well positioned along the rail down the backstretch and on the turn, swung outside in upper stretch, challenged for the lead outside the winner
 with a sixteenth of a mile to go and just missed in a game effort. COFFEE PLEASE , hustled to the early lead, angled in, set the pace along the rail and
 weakened the final furlong. MIKE THE TIGER , pinched back leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch
 and passed tired horses. YES MEANS NO saved ground on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and retreated. PERFECT HEIR chased the pace two wide,
 was floated to the three path leaving the turn and gave way. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY , outrun, raced in the two path leaving the turn. KNOCKABOUT ,
 three wide on the turn, faltered. NOT NECESSARILY chased the pace three wide, floated to the four path leaving the turn and faltered. DUSKY bore in
 leaving the starting gate, rushed up outside horses mid way down the backstretch, raced four wide and dropped back leaving the turn.

 the pace and weakened. INSTINCTIVE saved ground on the turn, angled out entering the stretch and failed to rally. LITTLE SONG circled horses on the

 horses and lugged in near the sixteenth pole despite urging by his rider. ROOKIE SALSA bobbled soon after the break, lacked speed, angled in leaving the
 backstretch, raced near the rail around the turn, waited a bit near mid stretch, kept on with interest but was not a serious threat. CLASSY SOLUTION

 entering the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and passed tired horses. PEP TALKING advanced four deep in
