 Footnotes
 I AIN'T NEVER lacked speed, raced off the rail on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, closed steadily outside horses and was up at the wire.
 GRANDIFLORA saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, angled to the five path in upper stretch, had aim on the lead approaching the sixteenth pole
 and hung between horses. UNCLE YOUDGE , slightly rank at the break, raced three wide on the turn, angled in in upper stretch, bid near the sixteenth pole
 and flattened out. TRICKY LION set the pace two wide around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. FLY E DUBAI , four deep on the turn,
 lacked the needed late effort. UPLIFTING showed speed near the rail and weakened leaving the turn.

 SO STREET was sent from the gate and reached a stalking spot inside, eased out leaving the three eighths, bid outside the leader to take command with a
 quarter to go, opened up when given his cue and won under a steady hand ride. ON THE TURF stumbled at the break, regrouped and trailed through the
 opening quarter mile, angled four wide into the lane and finished up willingly to gain the place. GET THERE JOHN chased inside, eased out for the drive,
 moved up between rivals near the sixteenth marker and kept on with some interest. MUSTA NEVER MET U sped clear early, set the pace towards the
 inside, was headed near the quarter pole and gave way in the final furlong. JUST ONE NOT TWO gave three wide pursuit, angled in around the turn then
 tired.

 PROMOTE settled back off of a contested pace, came under pressure past the half mile marker and picked up some steam, swung five wide in upper
 stretch, made a grinding run outside rivals and under left handed pressure and got the bob. GOTHAM NEWS rated off the rail, moved up four wide into the
 lane, gained a slim lead near mid stretch, edged away slightly heading towards the sixteenth marker, kept on gamely but was nipped at the line. MUCHO
 MAS GRANDE saved ground under some rating, took closer order leaving the far turn, eased out into the lane, was blocked and steadied behind rivals from
 the three sixteenths to just past the eighth pole, swung out, straightened away to finish fast but simply ran out of ground. BOBBY THE BRAIN gained a good
 spot off the dueling trio early on, stayed towards the inside in upper stretch, had a seam close up and had to steady when blocked near the three sixteenths,
 worked between runners inside the sixteenth pole but was out finished. HAYNE'S FEVER got engaged in a pace battle between foes nearing the first turn,
 continued the battle past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. CAUSE HE'S WESTERN , three deep disputing the pace, stayed willingly past the eighth
 pole then faded. BATTLE READY , sent to the front and secured the rail, was hounded by a pair of rivals to his outside, ceded the lead with a furlong to go
 and weakened very late. ONE PROUD WILDCAT lost contact early.

 Footnotes
 MINISTER'S STRIKE saved ground on the turns under patient handling, eased out approaching the stretch, was taken to the six path in upper stretch,
 gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. FRONT LINE PAIGE lacked speed, raced two wide leaving the backstretch, entered the stretch four
 deep, floated to the eight path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. DAYSTRIKE stalked the pace, advanced three wide leaving the far turn, challenged
 for the lead in mid stretch and weakened in the drive. SMART TWO A T saved ground on the turns and failed to rally. BERLINER advanced four deep
 leaving the far turn, bid for the lead in mid stretch and weakened the final furlong. CORT'N ASONG saved ground setting the pace and tired the final eighth
 of a mile. STARRY MESSENGER , racing with out front shoes, left the far turn three wide between horses, drifted to the eight path in upper stretch and
 lacked a rally. TERO , unhurried early, was not a factor. NO MORE TALK prompted the pace two wide and faltered.

 Footnotes
 JOEY GOTCHA vied inside early, rated back off the pace through the backstretch run, angled three wide heading to the quarter pole, closed in under a
 drive, secured command nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. ICE CREAM DUDE broke a step slow, rushed up soon after and disputed the issue
 between rivals, shook clear past the five eighths, dropped in and set the pace, took pressure leaving the far turn, could not resist the winner but kept on
 willingly to save the place. KUSTAAFU saved ground early, eased out nearing the five eighths pole, angled four wide making a run into the lane, ranged up
 nearing mid stretch, layed in some and failed to seriously sustain. MIKE THE TIGER leaned in at the break and bumped with a rival, checked when pinched
 back soon after, lagged well off the pace, was under a drive past the three eighths, angled five wide and had some late action. CHARISMATIC BLUE , three
 wide early, angled out and failed to menace. AWESOME AGENDA attended the pace three deep around the first turn, dropped in a bit and forced the issue
 outside ICE CREAM DUDE from the three eighths to upper stretch then faded late. TOO MUCH TIME failed to menace. SUN BAHRAM , bumped at the
 break, chased three wide and gave way near the quarter pole. SATURDAY FIGHTER , under a firm hold stalking inside early on, remained in range to the
 far turn and dropped back. HUG ON NOLAN dropped far back. An objection by the rider of MIKE THE TIGER against ICE CREAM DUDE for alleged
 interference leaving the gate was not allowed

 JARVIS STEEL prompted the pace outside YOU CAN NEVER TELL, gained a short lead in mid stretch and was fully extended to prevail. LOVE YOU
 MUCH broke sluggishly, circled the turn three wide, floated to the five path in upper stretch and closed outside rivals. YOU CAN NEVER TELL saved ground
 setting a pressured pace and faded in the drive. MORE ABUNDANCE , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and
 finished gamely. BROOKS ROBINSON hesitated slightly at the break, raced two wide on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and flattened out.
 GODLOVESASINNER , fractious in the starting gate, failed to be a factor and angled to the four path turning for home. MIDNIGHT JUSTICE hugged the
 inner rail around the turn while outrun. WE MADE IT trailed.

 Footnotes
 WARRIOROFTHEROSES attended the pace to the inside of THROW THE FADE, maintained his position under some coaxing, drew on near even terms
 leaving the far turn, gained a slim lead past the three sixteenths, dueled into the lane, spurted clear under a left handed drive heading towards mid stretch,
 widened the advantage with a sixteenth to go the held sway while kept to task. BRIGHTON LANE rated back off the pace, was under pressure three wide
 into the lane, eased out a bit and worked his way between rivals, straightened and closed well. THROW THE FADE grabbed a short lead early on, set the
 pace in the two path but could not shake the winner, dueled with that one from the far turn to upper stretch, could not kick on leaving the eighth pole and
 faded. AVEENU MALCAINU broke a step slow, moved up between rivals around the first turn and gained a stalking spot three wide, was under pressure
 pursuing the top pair leaving the far turn, lodged a mild bid soon after, gave futile chase into the lane and faded. SANAVI was hung out four wide stalking
 the pace, came under pressure leaving the far turn and weakened. RIVINGTON , well placed toward the inside and in range of a contested pace, failed to
 kick on near the five sixteenths and faltered.

 Footnotes
 SPEED GAME saved ground stalking the pace, angled to the four path in upper stretch, closed determinedly under strong riding, bid for the lead in mid
 stretch and proved best. AIRE BUENO (CHI) hugged the inner rail on the far turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, challenged for the lead inside
 the winner in mid stretch and finished gamely. BAY BRIDGE set the pace along the rail and weakened in the drive. ZEN'S LAND hugged the inner rail down
 the backstretch, angled out on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and failed to rally. SENOR LOUIE drifted out entering the first turn, prompted
 the pace two wide around the far turn and gave way. BRICKYARD KITTEN , four wide the far turn, was outrun. LON'S TRUE PASSION prompted the pace
 two wide, weakened on the far turn and drifted to the six path in upper stretch.
