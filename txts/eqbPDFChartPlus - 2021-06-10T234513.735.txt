 Footnotes
 BIOGRAPHY tapered in down the backstretch and took the lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled clear mid turn, was steadily handled through the upper
 stretch and held on well. BACKSEAT LOVER lacked room most of the backstretch, bid nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn in the five path, dueled for
 second inside the furlong pole but couldn't gain on the winner. FIRE CONTROL set a pressured pace inside, was headed approaching the quarter pole,
 dropped back midway on the turn then weakened from the top of the lane. TOTETHENOTE chased the pace from the outside, rounded the turn about the
 six path and finished evenly. GENTLEMEN DALE steadied at the start and settled well back off the rail, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn
 in the six and seven paths and finished evenly. GREY TIGER chased the pace from the inside, rounded the turn at the rail then weakened in the stretch.
 ONTHEWHISTLE chased the pace from the inside, steadied at the rail nearing the quarter pole, eased off the rail through the turn but showed little further in
 the stretch. FORREST GRUMP chased the pace toward the outside, angled in nearing the quarter pole, faded in the four path rounding the turn, showed no
 response to steady insistence through the lane and was vanned off.

 Footnotes
 QUEEN OF THE HILL stalked the pace on the outside and drew to near even terms approaching the three-eighths pole, made a bid leaving the
 five-sixteenths, dueled through the turn in the three path and took over near the three-sixteenths pole, then continued the duel in the upper stretch and drew
 off in the final sixteenth. IDENTITY THEFT hustled up and angled in to the rail to rate the pace inside, was met at near even terms near the three-eighths
 pole and dueled from there through the turn on the rail, was caught near the three-sixteenths pole, then continued the duel in the upper stretch but was
 outfinished. TOWN LEADER settled off the pace on the outside and made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole, took the far turn in the five path, then dug in
 under steady handling and was gaining on the runner up. MY AWSOME ALIE settled well off the pace on the inside, made a bid leaving the three-eighths
 pole, rounded the turn in the three path, then raced down the stretch and finished evenly. FARREST RIM settled off the pace on the outside and made a bid
 leaving the five-sixteenths pole, then rounded the turn in the five path and finished evenly. SEVEN POINT SIX, saving ground into the first turn and settled
 off the pace on the inside, made a bid near the three-eighths pole and rounded the turn on the rail, but weakened in the lane. EVERYTHINGISAWESUM
 was bumped at the start by Bombita then raced well back and was never a factor. BOMBITA broke out and bumped into Everythingisawesum at the start,
 then was never a factor.

 MINING FOR CANDY accelerated to the front past the half mile pole and rated the pace off the rail, was asked entering the top of the lane, opened up
 through the upper stretch, under a mostly vigorous hand ride, but was taken in hand later yards. TEAM ASTROLOGY chased the early pace toward the
 outside, rounded the turn about the three path, dueled for place in the upper stretch, though, proved no match for the winner. SULTRY ROSE gave chase
 about the four path, eased outward through the turn, entered the stretch in the eight path and was along for third in late yards. WHATEVERYOUSAYBABY
 chased the pace from the inside, rounded the turn off the rail and was outfinished for third later yards. ZINGALONG gave chase inside, rounded the turn at
 the rail then weakened down the lane. DO YOU LIKE THAT chased the early pace toward mid track, rounded the turn about the three path then weakened
 in the stretch. HONOR AND RICHES came away a bit rank, angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the six path then weakened.

 EMBLEM'S ESTATE was slow into stride at the start then rated well back on the outside, made a bid approaching the three-eighths pole and rounded the
 turn in the five path while catching up to the top two mid-turn, then engaged in a three-way duel out of the turn and down the lane and took the nod just
 under the wire. SET'EM UP JOE broke in and bumped Satan's Friday at the start then rated off the pace a distant second, made a bid leaving the
 five-sixteenths pole and took over mid-turn in the three path, then engaged in a three-way duel out of the turn and down the lane and just missed first.
 RAMBAM ROCKER rated a clear pace on the inside and rounded all the turns on the rail, was caught mid-turn and engaged in a three-way duel out of the
 turn and down the stretch and just missed second. BIG BAD DUDE rated off the pace two wide between horses and made a bid near the five-sixteenths
 pole, rounded the turn in the three path, then dug in down the stretch under steady handling and was gaining on the top three finishers. NAVIGATE, saving
 ground through the first turn, rated off the pace inside, then was steadied at the rail approaching the five-sixteenths pole and showed little further. SATAN'S
 FRIDAY broke a step slow and was bumped after the start by Set'em Up Joe, then saved ground into the first turn but was never a factor. UNCLE JACK
 rated off the pace three wide on the outside but was through early.

 Footnotes
 CAPTAIN HOLIDAY settled close inside the first turn, eased out entering the backstretch, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, improved in the four path
 rounding the far turn and dug in down the lane to get up the final yards. CHATTER PATTERN broke in to make contact with Spoiled By God then settled
 close off the rail the opening turn, took the lead at the three eighths pole, raced clear toward the five sixteenths, came under pressure at the rail midway on
 the far turn, was headed in later yards and reluctantly ceded nearing the wire. GINGERS HERO settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, started a
 bid past the seven sixteenths pole, took aim nearing the five sixteenths, dueled at a close disadvantage through the far turn, drifted a bit entering the stretch
 and weakened the final sixteenth. TO HONOR STEPHANIE saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved her position in the three
 path of the far turn but showed little further the final sixteenth. UNCLE TITO exchanged contact with Crazy Charles leaving the gate, rounded the opening
 turn about the four path, settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid mildly past the three eighths but rounded the far turn in the six path and showed little
 further. SPOILED BY GOD broke in to make contact with Forest Ranger and was bumped shortly afterward by Chatter Pattern then shuffled back, saved
 ground well back from that point, eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of the far turn and showed little
 further. YODELING HONEY raced well back and outside then saved ground on the far turn. TAZMANIAN CHARLIE came away awkwardly and out and
 made contact with Forest Ranger, drifted into the first turn then bid only mildly past the three eighths pole. After being jostled at the start, FOREST RANGER
 rated close inside the first turn, lacked a clear path from the three eighths pole and through most of the backstretch then faded rounding the far turn. CRAZY
 CHARLES exchanged contact with Uncle Tito leaving the gate, hustled to the front approaching the three quarter pole than angled a bit inward to show the
 way early, moved to the inside midway on the first turn, was taken in hand leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gradually eased and walked off.

 Footnotes
 HECALLEDHERTROUBLE hustled up to rate the pace outside early then angled in nearing the five-sixteenths pole to widen her lead through the turn off
 the rail, then drove down the lane under steady handling and was much the best. RAELYN'S STAR gave chase on the outside and rounded the turn in the
 four path, then dug in down the lane and finished evenly. DEFENSE SECRETARY gave chase on the inside, rounded the turn on the rail, then came out
 sharply mid-stretch and gained in the final sixteenth, finishing well. SISTER AIM angled in quickly to chase the pace on the inside, then angled out past the
 five-sixteenths pole to take the turn in the four path, but leveled off in the stretch. JACKY'S CORK broke a step slow, then gave chase well off the pace on
 the inside, rounded the turn off the rail, then raced down the lane to finish well. FALSE PROPHET gave chase from the inside, rounded the turn in the three
 path, then finished evenly. GAB'S LIL LEAGUER gave chase on the outside and rounded the turn in the five path, then finished evenly. COLD SPRING
 CANYON broke a step slow, gave chase well off the pace outside, took the turn in the three path, then finished evenly. MY COUSIN VICKY broke a step
 slow and was never a factor. LOVIN' LIME raced wide and well back; was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 PRINCE DEREK steadied early then settled off the pace toward the inside the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, progressed steadily six wide
 through the far turn and dug in at the top of the stretch to surge clear in later yards. INDUSTRY LEADER rated close two deep and moved to even terms
 approaching the nine sixteenths pole, took the nod approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear toward the quarter, dug in through the lane but was
 caught leveling off later yards and just lasted for second. NORTHERN LUCK exchanged contact with Star Sense leaving the gate and rated off the early
 pace about the four path, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, finished well and just missed second. COUNTER
 MOVE, off the pace in the three path, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole then drifted through the far turn and leveled off down the lane. JE NE SAIS PAS
 rated off the pace and off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened stride down the
 lane. MOUNTAIN CRY, shuffled back early, raced well back toward the inside the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at
 the rail and showed little further. SHENANDOAH came away a step slow and exchanged contact with Dancing Roy leaving the gate, raced well back in the
 three path the first turn and showed little response down the backstretch. DANCING ROY exchanged contact with Shenandoah leaving the gate, rounded
 the first turn in the six path then never factored. STAR SENSE exchanged contact with Northern Luck leaving the gate, rated a slim lead while angling in
 through the front stretch, was met at even terms nearing the nine sixteenths pole, yielded the nod toward the seven sixteenths, dropped back approaching
 the quarter then weakened at the rail rounding the far turn.

 Footnotes
 DIONYSUS' CHALICE came across the path of Synergy Unbridled entering the first turn and angled to the rail to set the pace inside, rounded the far turn off
 the rail, then drove down the stretch under steady handling and held on. BINN GOODE settled off the pace on the inside and improved through the
 backstretch on the rail without encouragement, made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole and angled out to round the turn in the five path, then dug in
 down the lane under steady handling and was slowly gaining on the winner. MR. JACOBY settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the
 three-eighths pole, steadily improved through the turn in the six path, then raced down the lane and was closing on the runner up. TALENT QUEST settled
 off the pace on the outside and made a bid approaching the five-sixteenths pole, went around the far turn in the four path, then weakened in the lane. TRUE
 HEIR settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid past the seven-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the five path, but leveled off in the stretch.
 CATCH MY CABOOSE exchanged contact with That's Who I Am at the start then was never a factor. THAT'S WHO I AM exchanged contact with Catch my
 Caboose at the start then was pinched back and was never a factor. SYNERGY UNBRIDLED was steadied moving into the first turn as Dionysus' Chalice
 came across his path, then stalked the pace but tired early and faded in the turn.

 Footnotes
 MINT TO FLY saved ground well off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, progressed nine wide through the far turn, took the lead a sixteenth away
 and raced clear in later yards. SWEET CURLS settled off the pace three wide, bid past the nine sixteenths pole, eased out into the backstretch, improved in
 the six path of the far turn, dueled to a slim brief lead in the upper stretch and dug in for second while yielding the win. GEMINI DREAM, off the pace in the
 four path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, had range in the three path of the far turn, angled in at the head of the lane, took close aim mid-stretch but
 was outfinished for second. CHOTEAU, off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, left the far turn six wide then leveled off in later
 yards. ADA COWGIRL raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced in range of the leaders while eight wide
 on the far turn then flattened out the final sixteenth. WINDSOR'S SUNSHINE drifted into the stretch the first time and rated a slim lead off the rail, was
 pressured at the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the far turn, was caught past the eighth pole and weakened the final
 sixteenth. After being carried out leaving the first turn, SEEKING SERA stalked the pace from the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
 drew to even terms nearing the head of the lane but dropped back from between horses a furlong away and weakened. SHANDONG DJ DRAGON saved
 ground off the pace, bid into the far turn, eased out through the turn, entered the stretch four wide and weakened. Carried out into the stretch the first turn,
 ICE BLUE VISION rated close off the rail through the front stretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, had aim at the rail through the backstretch then
 weakened from the top of the lane. GIFTOFGRACE was never a factor.
