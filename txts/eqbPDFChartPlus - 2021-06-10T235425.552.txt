 Footnotes
 IN THE MOOD three wide in pursuit, advanced on the front through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside for home, seized command at the
 three-sixteenths, drew clear under a drive kept to task. DREAM FEVER established the front and showed the way in hand from the two path through
 moderate splits, cut the corner into upper stretch, got headed at the three-sixteenths, weakened while well clear of the rest and second best. TONI ROX two
 to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, tired while along for the show
 honors. CITY OF THE DEAD attended the leader three then two wide coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, cornered three wide for home,
 faltered in the stretch. DISCOMANIA chased inside coming under prolonged urging from the half mile pole, faded through the latter portion of the turn, cut
 the corner into upper stretch and folded.

 Footnotes
 WARRANTY sat reserved in the two path for the first three-quarters, got angled six wide coming into the stretch, closed in readily on the front runners, took
 over past the sixteenth pole and edged away. CITY SECTION sat loosely pocket tracking the pacesetter, cut into the gap after going six furlongs, tipped into
 the two path stepping into the stretch, idled behind rivals for the next furlong, was eased back slightly to gain the access required to get taken to the outside
 in midstretch, did just that, altering course into path four, bobbled slightly soon after being straightened away, with no discernable loss of momemtum
 though, closed in willingly but had to settle for the place. MADAME UNO prompted FAHAN MURA while taking the two path, began to narrow in as the third
 fraction was being finalized, was abreast of the leader spinning into the lane, had already poked a head down in front at the furlong grounds before asked to
 give much more, got reeled in leaving the sixteenth pole and weakened into the show slot. JONQUIL saved ground to the quarter pole and came up empty.
 FAHAN MURA broke on top and retained the advantage, carved out the pace, rated along the inisde and shadowed by MADAME UNO to the outside, saw
 that opponent draw up after going three-quarters, released the lead without putting up much resistance then steadily backed away. VASILIKA sat within
 range of the pacesetter positioned in the three path, was put to a drive past the midway point on the far turn, gave way. SILVER MAGNOLIA took up the
 chase from the two path, got fanned out seven wide down the lane to no avail. QUEENOFTHECHANNEL raced three wide on each bend, had no rally.

 OFF LIMITS (IRE) bumped at the start by TIME AND MOTION who broke outwards a step, settled in reserve saving ground at the tail of the compact field,
 awaited patiently inside until the five-sixteenths, angled out inside that station to swing five wide into upper stretch and was roused under hand urging
 straightened away, responded with a good kick to forge past the field and take command a furlong from home, drew clear under a hand ride getting taken in
 hand in the final strides to the wire, the outcome in no doubt. SASSY LITTLE LILA established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside
 uncontested through sensible splits patiently handed awaiting a challenge in earnest, had TIME AND MOTION latch on midway on the far turn, came under
 coaxing nearing the quarter pole as that rival upped the pressure to the outside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
 overhauled a furlong from home, proved no match for the top one while digging in to secure the place honors. CELESTINE rated just off the inside in closest
 aim of the leader early on, had TIME AND MOTION circle outside to get first run on the leader and tuck in front with five furlongs to go, shifted three wide in
 response briefly losing some position, tracked three wide through the far turn coming under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, angled four wide into
 upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild kick to latch on the aforementioned foe inside the eighth pole, dug in and battled
 head to head to the wire but was bested for the place honors at the finish. TIME AND MOTION broke out a step at the start bumping lightly with OFF
 LIMITS, tracked three wide just off the pace early on before advancing to closest aim of the leader midway down the backstretch tucking to the two path five
 furlongs from home appearing to want first run at that rival, advanced to latch on the leader through the far turn coming under light coaxing with
 five-sixteenths to run, spun three wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, got shaken off nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages.
 MALIBU STACY brushed the off side stall at the start, tracked the pace along the inside lightly coaxed along, came under encouragement with
 five-sixteenths remaining, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the lane.

 CURTIS brushed with another in the shadow of the starting gate, snatched control away from MOLLICA during the initial stages, was in hand shaking off the
 remaining members of this quintet while on the backstretch, sailed along in the two path, alone in front, squandered some of his advantage by having the
 pilot keep the mount well in reserve during the last stages of the run around the bend, was asked a little and instantly re-asserted itself, winning best
 described as being ridden out. BAR NONE brushed right after the start, chased the loose leader under hand encouragement on the turn, fanned out into
 path during the initial portion of the stretch, proved no match. CONQUEST EXPRESSO brushed from each end after the field had been sent on its way,
 underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, stepped into the stretch and went on to secure the show. THE ORPHAN MIRACLE rode the rail, cut the corrner
 under a full drive to no avail. MOLLICA out-sprinted by the top one despite a hand ride in the early stages, tracked the leader while saving ground and
 faltered.

 Footnotes
 EIGHT TOWN brushed the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside just off the pace dispute, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home and
 advanced quickly to issue a challenge swinging four wide into upper stretch, took over command just outside the eighth pole, inched away under a drive
 kept to task. TOMMY T vied inside a pair coaxed along from the get go, spun just off the inside for home, got displaced from command a furlong out, dug in
 head to head and bested SWITZERLAND for the place honors. SWITZERLAND vied in the two path between foes coming under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, cornered three wide for home, dug in head to head with the aforementioned foe and was overtaken in tandem just outside the eighth pole,
 tussled through to the finish with TOMMY T but was bested by that rival for the place honors while well clear for the show. COMMANDEERING bumped at
 the start by CURLOUT who broke outwards, chased four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn and improved position for the last major share. VIA
 CASTAGNA vied three wide outside a pair under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, floated five to six wide at the quarter pole, tired in the stretch. CURLOUT
 broke out at the start bumping COMMANDEERING, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide at the head of the
 stretch and made no impact.

 Footnotes
 SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN got set up in the two path after the break, was patiently ridden stalking a group of front runners vying for command, was given his
 cue for the drive home, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, kicked into his best and closed in readily, wore down PORTANDO in the final
 seventy yards and edged away. PORTANDO broke in line with SPECTROLITE, vied for command from the path two, as the middle participant of a group of
 three, was put to a drive for the drive home, fought his way to a narrow advantage during the ensuing furlong, dug in stubbornly to defend it, got collared by
 the winner late, but gamely held on to salvage second. RUNAWAY POSSE got guided over to the rail in short order, rode it to right around the
 five-sixteenths marker, swung outward into the lane, went wider and wider until seven to eight wide late, finished well, but missed out on the place. LORD
 OF LOVE saved ground for the opening half, came approximately five wide into the stretch, paused, in close proximity to another in midstretch, tipped
 slightly to the inside and was given its cue, flashed a strong kick in the last sixteenth en route to earning the last major check. WHISKEY SEVEN took up the
 chase from the two path, got roused past the five-sixteenths marker and came up empty. SPECTROLITE left the gate in a practical dead heat with
 PORTANDO, cut over to the inside, with the aforementioned foe still, so to speak, glued on, was along the rail showing the way, forced to fend off a pair of
 opponents to the outside, a task with a duration measuring the majority of the opening half, got hooked up in a duel with the second place finisher after
 leaving RAPPEL behind, fell back, but barely by the beginning of the final furlong, had some fight left for another sixteenth before weakening. RATE FOR
 ME chased the ongoing three-way pace dispute taking the inside, faltered. RAPPEL three wide, disputed the pace as the widest of a threesome to the top of
 the lane before giving way.

 Footnotes
 AQUAPHOBIA away well, atttained a forward position, prompted the pacesetter from the two path, crept up in hand to poke a head down in front
 approaching the quarter pole, inched away from the former pacesetter, responded when asked past the three-sixteenths marker to extend the margin, held
 well to stay sufficiently in the clear. MEMORIES OF PETER rode the rail to the quarter pole, got angled into path six from upper to midstretch, had a good
 finish down the center ot the course to garner the place. KING OF SPADES was rated forwardly placed along the rail, shifted into path four for optimal
 clearance from the top of the lane to midstretch, went on to secure the show. FOCUS GROUP took the inside route, swung five wide heading for the
 three-sixteenths marker, straightened away and put together a strerch response good enough to claim the last major check. GAUGUIN (GER) spent some
 energy during an an emergency equipment repair behind the starting gate prior to the start, proceeded to come away without apparent mishap, tipped to the
 outside early on the backstretch after taking the inside route on the clubhouse bend, tipped one path wider after entering the far turn, responded when
 asked unleashing a three wide run from the five-sixteenths marker, was under a strong drive taking path five for entrance into the stretch, flattened out.
 RAPT quickly placed along the inside, vacated it at the tive-sixteenths pole, was under encouragement coming into the stretch, made no impact. KABANG
 took up the chase two wide and had no rally. SPRING EMPEROR saved ground and failed to menace. CONVIVIAL launched itself to the front with a three
 wide run, showed the way from the iniside thereafter, loosely pressed early, got headed coming to the quarter pole and steadily backed away. AZAR in
 midpack two wide, gave way. LIQUID ALOHA three wide on both turne, was pulled up coming to the midstretch and subsequently vanned off.

 SHARP AZTECA established the front and showed the way in hand from the two path, came under some pressure from BIRD SONG and DIVINING ROD
 through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and drew clear under a drive getting geared
 down in the final strides to the finish. DIVINING ROD four wide in aim of the aforementioned foe, advanced to stack outside the top pair through the turn,
 came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went five wide at the head of the stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and second best.
 TOM'S READY saved ground in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing half a mile from home angling off the inside to the two path by midway on
 the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch moving in tandem with TOMMY MACHO to his outside and improved position to secure the show honors.
 TOMMY MACHO five wide down the backstretch near the rear, tucked three wide half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
 six wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head with the aforementioned foe passing a pair of tired foes through the stretch and got bested for the show
 honors at the finish. ROSS (IRE) forwardly placed inside, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened
 in the final furlong. BIRD SONG prompted the pace of SHARP AZTECA from the three path down the backstretch inching closer to latch on that rival
 through the turn joined to the outside by DIVINING ROD, got on near even terms midway on the turn between rivals, came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, got shaken off nearing the quarter pole and swung three to four wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the wire.

 Footnotes
 ZIGMUND came away alertly, pressed the issue from the two path, was lightly hand urged during the run around the bend, drew abreast of the runner up as
 the half was being completed, was asked for more as a tussle between them began, led by a slim margin by the furlong marker, steadily extended the
 advantage, ridden out. BROCKMONINOFF inward with its initial step, went shoulder to shoulder with its next door neighbor for the next two strides, settled
 along the inside, vied with the winner, put up resistance before relinquishing, then reached the wire in time to salvage second, although still moving well.
 CAUSFORCELEBRATION shied out early on the backstretch and away from BLESSED HOINOUR, itself shying away from SIM CARD, proceeded along in
 the five path heading to the conclusion of the backstretch, found room and worked out a tuck into path three a few jumps beyond the half mile pole, picked
 up interest, still rated though, as the half was being completed, was put to a ride angling four wide into the stretch, finished with a flourish, but missed out
 second. DIAMOND SETTER in the two path stepping onto the turn, altered course into path four from upper to midlstretch and closed in well enough to earn
 the final significant slice of the pot. LUTHERAN RAGS got leaned upon by the winner for the first two jumps, departed the backstrech from the two path, got
 swung four wide into upper stretch and rallied mildly. LAKE PARTY saved ground on the turn, angled three wide for the stretch run and made no impact.
 SIM CARD within range in the two path on the turn, had no rally. BLESSED HONOUR shied from another early on the backstretch, pursued the top
 twosome from the three path and tired. HEROISM two wide at the top of the turn, failed to menace. GOOD OLD BOY rode the rail, cut the corner under a
 drive and came up empty. FRITTER off a half length the slowest, stepped onto the turn from the two path, never reached a contending position. SCOOPSIE
 PATATO sent over quickly to the rail, was through after going a half.
