 Footnotes
 MASTER MICK away alertly, set a pressured pace then entire trip while cleverly rated, turned back a bid from HORSERADISH nearing the quarter pole and
 edged clear late under right handed urging. HORSERADISH pressured the winner two wide into the far turn, drew on near even terms for the lead nearing
 the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch and gamely held on for second. SKIP ROYALE trailed into the stretch, rallied determinedly in the five path and
 just missed getting up for second by the narrowest of margins. DAGGERS DUEL well placed, failed to respond. PURE GOLD LINER vied for the lead along
 the rail into the stretch then faded late. ORIGAMI DOWNTOWN allowed to settle, inched closed outside in the four path midway down the backstretch then
 came up empty.

 Footnotes
 THAT'S EXCITING settled just behind the leaders along the inside, shifted out three wide approaching the far turn, made the lead just inside the quarter
 pole then widened through the stretch under strong right handed urging to win as much the best. DESCARADO prompted the pace two wide for a half,
 made the lead set the pace to the quarter pole then was no match for the winner. DAME AMOUR hopped at the start rushed to the lead before the
 clubhouse turn, set the pace for nearly a half, had speed into the stretch then weakened. SPRINGTIME CITY trailed for nearly a half in the five path, loomed
 boldly two wide on the second turn then came up empty. BULLINDA had speed for five furlongs then faltered.

 Footnotes
 COLONY CLASSIC stalked the pace for a half, rallied between horses on the second turn, made the lead in upper stretch, was forced inward a bit and
 proved best in a stretch long drive. COTTONWOOD CANYON never far back, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, drew on even terms for
 the lead at the top of the stretch, was well handled while lugging in dueled until the final stages and finished second best. KUTSCHMAN broke in front, set
 the pace around the clubhouse turn while angling in to the rail, was headed briefly before a half, maintained control into the stretch, was in tight before the
 furlong marker as the top pair shifted inward, steadied for several strides then came on again late in a game effort. WANDERING KITTEN bobbled at the
 start, moved up in the four path on the far turn then leveled off. GLORY KINGDOM was outrun. ONE BETTER was through after a half. BANK OF DAD was
 no threat. PEPPERMINT PRINCE allowed to settle, surged to the front five wide before a half, had speed into the second turn then came up empty.

 WISH TONITE never far back, rallied steadily along the rail through the stretch, steadied momentarily as the leader drifted in at the sixteenth pole, dug in
 late and got up in the final strides. PRIVATE HUMOR sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace, drifted in late then couldn't handle the
 winner. LADY PANTHER unhurried early, closed determinedly three wide through the stretch. BASKETBALL BELLA pressed the pace two wide into the
 stretch then gradually weakened. VALIANT PRINCESS failed to menace. SIENA SLEW was no threat. ROSE'S ASSET stalked the pace three wide into the
 stretch then gave way. PATTY'S MISCHIEF broke inward, was quickly righted and trailed throughout.
