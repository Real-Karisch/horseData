 MY COUNTRY GIRL set the pace in the clear from off the rail, maintained an open advantage into upper stretch, dug in late to hold off BRYNLEE'S
 LEMONADE, who stalked the aforementioned from outside going three to four wide through the turn, closed the gap late but could not get past.
 HOLLYWOOD BOBBIE settled off the pace in about the three path, came into the stretch still three wide and gained show honors. I TEN was
 forwardly-positioned tracking in behind early, eased back from between rivals and switched out near the seven-sixteenths, advanced three then four then
 five wide on the turn but could not sustain the effort. TRUST EMILY passed tired rivals. SHESA GOLDIGGER tracked from between foes then steadied
 slightly when in just a hair tight near the three-eighths, failed to rally thereafter. TRIGGERED chased from inside, tired.

 RARERARE settled between foes early, encouraged three then four wide on the turn, came five wide out of that bend and took command at the top of the
 stretch, drove clear. GATITO chased in behind the leading pair, switched outside the eventual winner at the head of the stretch about six deep, was no
 match but ran on to get the place. BEHOLD'S HOTTIE was urged at the break, chased from outside, lugged out in late stretch under left-handed stick and
 lost the place late. FIELD GENERAL was unhurried early, came into the stretch four wide while picking up steam, shifted in a bit in upper stretch then was
 forced inwardly in late stretch while continuing to gain. TRUCKSTOP AFFAIR raced outside foes mid-pack going four then five wide on the turn, came into
 the stretch six deep, shifted in through mid-stretch for room forcing a couple rivals into tight quarters. ROCKY BAR SIX set the pace on a clear lead,
 weakened in the stretch, steadied near the wire. SEASON FINALE was never a threat. MY SASSY SALSA chased briefly inside into the turn, tired.

 Footnotes
 ENDLESS THYME stalked just off the pace, bid four wide between runners on the turn, took the lead by the top of the stretch, held sway over a game
 SOUTH WIMBLEDON, who raced inside the aforementioned just off the leaders, bid three wide between foes in conjunction with that rival, was game to the
 wire but couldn't get past. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT settled in the clear racing well off the fence, shifted in a bit coming into the stretch, ran on late to gain
 show honors over TAX MONEY, who pursued the pace five wide through the turn, lacked the needed late kick and lost third late. SHAULA set the pace from
 the two path facing pressure, weakened. FLYING PRETTY was outpaced early, swung seven wide and ran on mildly. AMERICAN RAISA was not a threat.
 DIABOLICAL QUEEN was urged forward at the break, chased along the rail, faded.

 AWARD IT settled off the leaders, saved ground through the turn while being given some coaxing, rallied late to get up in time over TEE EM EYE, who set
 the pace facing pressure from outside rivals, came off the fence while edging clear in upper stretch, was denied late. FLYIN FALYNN settled into stride
 toward the back early, advanced five then six wide on the turn, kept on for show honors over GAME TIME DECISION, who pressed the pace from between
 foes two to three wide on the turn, could not go on with the top ones. EXTREME CAUTION brushed the outer rival at the start, eased back and switched out
 heading up the backstretch, moved forward four to five wide between foes on the turn, evened out in the drive. MISS INVASIVE was brushed at the break
 but close early, eased off leaving the backstretch, shifted in turning for home, failed to rally. JAMAICAN CENTS pressed the pace three to four wide
 between foes into the turn, gave way and faded.

 Footnotes
 COMIC HOT ROD stalked the pace advancing three wide into the turn to apply pressure outside HOT CHARLIE and passing a tiring TRACE OF GOLD,
 dueled briefly with the former then pulled clear in the lane under steady handling. HOT CHARLIE moved through inside a rival to take a narrow lead just
 outside the half-mile pole, vied with COMIC HOT ROD to upper stretch but was no match for that one while second best. CHAMPITO eased back and
 shifted in up the backstretch, moved to the rail entering the turn drawing nearer the leaders, came out three wide for the drive, was best of the rest. ROCKY
 PROSPECT chased the leaders outside up the backstretch then four to five wide and between foes through the turn, lugged in a bit in upper stretch and
 evened out. SNIGGLE settled into stride switching outside the aforementioned, went widest going five to six deep through the turn and had no late kick.
 FAVORITE STORM was within range three to four wide on the turn but came up empty. SEASIDE SMOOCH lacked early speed while shifting in early,
 saved ground on the turn then came out for the stretch run but was not a threat. TRACE OF GOLD set the early tempo for the opening three-sixteenths
 racing off the rail, gave way and faded. POP QUIZ had an awkward beginning but showed interest in the stretch.

 AFFLUENT GENTLEMAN attended the pace from off the inside, edged clear on the turn, held sway under steady handling through the lane. PLUM DANDY
 was bumped and squeezed at the break then allowed to settle, advanced four to six wide on the turn into upper stretch and continued to gain steadily but
 slowly. UNLEASH THE BEAST broke inwardly bumping a rival, stalked mostly four to five wide, edged closer into upper stretch then evened out late.
 CONQUEST SMARTEE exchanged a light brush at the start, chased from between foes three wide into the turn, lost ground and shifted in a path near the
 quarter pole, kept on in the lane but missed show honors. ALL TRUMPED UP broke outwardly, attended the pace three to four wide into the turn, was asked
 for more but came up empty in the stretch. FLAT FAST bumped the inner rival then was bumped by the outside foe at the start, shifted in about three wide
 mid-pack into the turn, came out in mid-stretch and ran on. DYNAMITE LAD was outpaced early, fanned five wide into the stretch angling out a further two
 paths late and improved position. FLATOUT WINNER exchanged a light brush at the start, chased in behind near the inside, failed to rally.
 FASTASIWANNABE bumped the outside foe at the start, was not a threat. QUINCY EXPRESS was coaxed forward inside to contend for the early lead,
 chased briefly then dropped back and faded. BOTTLE SHOCK was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 SECRET SEAL stalked the pace from outside going three to four wide on the turn, took the lead in upper stretch and edged clear while keeping to task late.
 LAST TO BLUSH stalked mid-pack in about the four to five path, got up for place late. REBEL RYETTE broke a bit awkwardly and was strongly urged
 forward three wide to press the pace into the turn, took the lead having shifted in a path early on that bend, drifted out a bit turning for home, fought on
 gamely but lost the place. SUCCESFUL SKY tracked from inside, switched outside foes about three deep near the midpoint of the turn then angled back
 inside a drifting rival at the head of the lane, was well-positioned but had no late kick. AWESOME DEDICATION was taken a hold of up the backstretch and
 angled in, saved ground on the turn while steadily advancing. CAROLS BOUTIQUE failed to threaten. SELL BABY SELL was a bit reluctant to load and
 never a threat. SASSY QUEENIE was fractious behind the gate and reluctant to load, dwelt at the start. EXCITING SUMMER set the early pace from off the
 rail, shifted in entering the turn and was overtaken, gave way and faded.

 Footnotes
 HYANNISPORT was urged along early while switching off the inside to about the three path, continued in that trajectory through the turn before angling in at
 the head of the stretch, bid up the rail in deep stretch to get up. PASSED BY PAUL was angled out widest soon after the start, moved forward off the leading
 pair and outside rivals four to five deep through the turn, bid late but missed. TIMELESS INDY prompted the pace three wide outside a rival, dispatched that
 foe but just failed to last. BORTSTEIN switched outside foes heading up the backstretch, began to advance three then four wide on the turn coming out six
 deep for the drive and gained mildly late. CYRUS BEENE shifted in and settled between foes into the turn, came out a bit for the drive and gained belatedly.
 HANDSOME SWEDE bobbled slightly at the break, chased three to four wide and between foes through the turn but was empty in late stretch. PADDY'S
 CHARM pressed from inside but off the fence, was empty in the stretch. TOMEGA stumbled then bumped a rival at the start and was not a threat. NUSRET
 was bumped at the break, chased inside, dropped back and faded. R GOLD CASE was in close early along the inside, dropped back and faded.

 Footnotes
 TRUST SANTIAGO stalked the pace, advanced five then four wide on the turn, took a narrow advantage from tiring pacesetter in upper stretch then just
 held from TETON, who settled off the pace outside foes, went four then five wide on the turn coming out six deep for the drive, drifted in a bit and brushed a
 rival in mid- to late-stretch and continued to gain steadily but slowly. MEGA SOURCE was unhurried early, began to pick it up fanning seven wide into the
 stretch and gained late. WHOOP WHOOP was forwardly-positioned tracking three to four wide and between foes into the turn, eased back and switched out
 five deep leaving that bend, was brushed lightly in mid-stretch by a foe then in tight late. DIABOLICAL TIME broke just a bit awkwardly then pressed the
 pace from outside before contending between rivals into upper stretch, weakened thereafter. SOLID GOLD BAR came out a bit at the break, set a
 pressured pace inside, weakened. HAPPY HENNESSY raced near the inside well back, came out a bit for the stretch and passed rivals. MR. SILVER
 EXPRESS was positioned mid-pack inside and failed to rally. SEA MERMAN was forced out a touch at the break, shifted in about three wide early and
 made no bid. THE GHOST OF DIXIE came out for the drive and made no rally. MR MOO was forced out a touch at the start, forwardly-positioned chasing
 the leaders and came up empty.
