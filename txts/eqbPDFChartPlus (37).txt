 PERFORMANCE REVIEW slight stumble at the start, was void of any early speed, went six wide into the second turn, made a bid in early stretch and
 edged clear for the win. KRAM tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn, met the bid of the winner, couldn't sustain the run and finished
 second best. BEAUTIFUL BALLAD set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the home turn, took a brief lead into the home turn, angled to the inside
 and was empty in early stretch. SUPER HUMOR forced the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn and was finished early.

 MCTHANKS was taken back early, went six wide into the second turn, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear for the win. VIC TORIES was
 unhurried early, ranged up seven wide into the second turn, couldn't sustain the rally, was no match late and finished second best. VEIL'S VENGEANCE
 tracked the early pace, went four wide into the second turn, angled in and finished a game third. SMASHED pressed the early pace, raced off the rail into
 the home turn, angled in and weakened. MR. DIGGER was up close early, raced along the inside and tired. TUCKER D raced in mid pack early and
 retreated. G M GAGE was outrun early and had no late rally. STORMIN NAVARONE was void of any speed and was no factor. FANCY STRIPE set a
 pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the first turn and faded.
