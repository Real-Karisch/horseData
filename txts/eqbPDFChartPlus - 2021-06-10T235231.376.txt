 ANATOLIAN HEAT chased off the rail, came out three deep into the stretch, drifted in some in midstretch, then came out and rallied under some left handed
 urging to gain the lead three wide in deep stretch and proved best. THE CRITICAL WAY sped to the early lead off the inside then stalked off the rail, angled
 in some leaving the hill, bid between foes a sixteenth out and edged a rival for the place. ERIC THE TROJAN angled in and saved ground off the pace,
 came out into the stretch then angled in again in upper stretch, came out in midstretch and finished well. BRANDOTHEBARTENDER three deep early,
 chased outside a rival, came out on the dirt crossing and four wide into the stretch and had a mild late bid. ANN ARBOR EDDIE had speed between horses
 then dueled outside a rival and bumped with that one on the hill, regained the lead in upper stretch, inched away in midstretch and weakened late. FLY TO
 MARS went up inside to duel for the lead and bumped with his pace rival on the hill, fought back into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
 TOUCHED BY AUTISM chased a bit off the rail, came out under urging in the stretch, had the rider lose the whip in deep stretch and lacked a rally. Rail on

 and was in a bit tight off heels past the quarter pole then came three wide into the stretch and finished willingly late outside the top pair. LITTLE NATI drifted
 four wide into the first turn, stalked four wide then three deep leaving the backstretch, drifted five wide into the stretch and bested the others. GEMINI
 JOURNEY came off the rail on the first turn and chased between horses, came out leaving the second turn and four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.
 BLONDY'S REWARD saved ground stalking the pace, continued inside into the stretch and weakened. OUTA HERE four wide into the first turn, settled off
 the rail, dropped back into and on the second turn and gave way. TIZ ADORE broke a bit slowly, angled in then came out three deep between foes on the

 WANDERING PATROL broke a bit slowly, went up inside to stalk the pace, waited briefly leaving the turn, bid along the rail in the stretch to gain the lead
 and won clear under vigorous handling and a long hold late. LOVING LYNDA chased outside then four wide into and on the turn and into the stretch and
 gained the place. ZILLINDA stalked between horses on the backstretch and turn, continued outside a rival into the stretch and edged foes for third three
 deep on the line. GOT AN OBSESSION angled in and dueled outside a rival, came out some into the stretch and lost the show between foes late. COCO
 KISSES broke a bit slowly, went up inside to stalk the pace, continued along the rail on the turn, got through inside in the stretch and was outfinished for a
 minor award. BELLA SIERRA stalked outside then three deep, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. WHATA FLIRT was in a good
 position stalking the pace outside a rival then three wide into and on the turn and into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. WARM IT UP
 settled off the rail on the backstretch and turn, swung four wide into the stretch and was not a threat. WHOA NESSIE bobbled slightly at the start, had speed
 inside to duel for the lead. PULPITINTHESKY hesitated to be away slowly, went up between foes then chased off the rail, came three wide into the stretch
 and lacked a further response.

 between horses then outside on the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and was outfinished. SEAU stalked four wide between horses on the first
 turn and three deep on the backstretch and second turn and into the stretch and could not quite summon the needed late kick between foes. DEAL WITH IT
