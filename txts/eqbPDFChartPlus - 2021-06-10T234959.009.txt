 Footnotes
 LADY MUNNINGS tracked the pace, waited through the turn for racing room, angled out into the stretch to gain clear racing room, then closed well and
 drew off inside the furlong marker. COZAR'S QUEEN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no
 match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. PAOLLA'S HEART allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane
 and got up for the show. JAMAICAN ME HAPPY allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and got up for a
 share. ONE SMART CALLER well placed and outside, drifted in into the stretch and faded. SHES HERE TO PARTY stalked the pace on the outside, bid
 outside of that one into the lane and stopped.
