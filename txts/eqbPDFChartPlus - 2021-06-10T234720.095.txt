 Footnotes
 JACK SNIPE'S moved in quickly early, contested the pace on the inside of SEA VOW, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked at the
 quarter-pole, shook clear under a left-handed whip into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong
 urging. EDEN GREY'S KITTEN was taken up when JACK SNIPES came in early, dropped to the rear of the field, had the rider fall back in the saddle while
 in the two path midway through the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then was roused, steadied briefly off the heels of SEA VOW inside the
 three-sixteenths, moved around that foe shortly thereafter, gained on his inside lead into the final furlong, switched leads coming to the sixteenth-pole and
 finished willingly for the place. C U TIGER was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside under coaxing on the turn, was roused in the two path at the
 quarter-pole, chased under the whip into the final furlong and was out-kicked while clear for the show. SEA VOW was hustled from the start, contested the
 pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, spun into the three path entering the stretch, was put to the whip around the three-sixteenths, dropped
 back into the final furlong and tired. HAIL TO THE NILE settled on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved
 out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch and failed to rally. KING BANDIT was taken up twice while rank on the backstretch, chased three wide while
 let out on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch and came up empty. Following the race, the rider of EDEN GREY'S KITTEN claimed foul against JACK
 SNIPES for alleged interference early in the race. After the stewards' review, no change was made to the order of finish. (Rail at 22 Feet)

 Footnotes
 POPS LEGACY stalked the pace in the two path, engaged the leader on the far turn, took the advantage inside the quarter-pole, kicked clear in upper
 stretch and proved best under steady urging. NEON SKY pulled while eager under restraint into the first turn then was rated in the two path, came under
 urging in the two path on the far turn, moved out a path at the furlong marker and finished willingly to just get the place. WHY JOEY WHY was rated on the
 inside, came under urging leaving the backstretch, chased inside on the far turn, moved to the two path at the furlong marker and narrowly missed the
 place. ROCKIN RUSTY RUE saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn in the
 three path and lacked the needed response while improving position. TUNE MY GUITAR went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside,
 was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. IPIDATE was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, vied
 inside of the winner under urging on the far turn, lost the advantage inside the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way. REAL TIME
 went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
 TAFT'S LIL BOY broke a step slow, was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, was unhurried while outside on the backstretch, went four

 Footnotes
 POUND OF HUNDREDS settled towards the rear, was urged along while inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, rallied in upper stretch, closed
 strongly to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole then drew away under steady handling. TOM AND ED'S GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace
 on the outside, made a bid in the two path on the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, spun into the stretch in the three path, came under the whip at
 the furlong marker, brushed with LITTLE MISS REBEL into the final sixteenth and earned the place while no match for the winner. LITTLE MISS REBEL
 was rated just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, tipped into the three path at the quarter-pole, made an outside bid at the furlong marker,
 brushed with TOM AND ED'S GIRL into the final sixteenth and weakened but was clear for the show. CARSON'S KATIE chased the pace, dropped back in
 the three path on the turn and tired. E. T. LANE was hustled from the start, moved up to take the lead, vied inside on the turn, was headed outside the
 quarter-pole and gave way. TATTLE TAIL SUE was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. THATS ROGER SONG
 bumped with a foe at the start, dropped back while racing with her head held high, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and was no
 factor. ROMAN BIRD was urged along off the pace, dropped back while inside on the turn and retreated. GO SAL GO settled under some urging, went two
 then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faltered.
