 BOB'N FOR SILVER assumed command with more than a circuit to go, controling the race on the front end, he rallied down the hill heading for the second
 last to widen his margin, still had a clear advantage jumping the last but had to duel with a hard charging ETCHED IN TIME in the late stages but held on for
 the win. ETCHED IN TIME settled towards the back of the field for the first circuit, started gaining ground going up the hill heading to the third last on the
 backside, but still had some ground to make up heading down the hill towards the second last jump, rallied after that to be in striking distance jumping the
 last then came with a rush but just missed at the wire. BLUE JEAN BABY settled mid pack for the first time around then moved up the draft the leader on the
 backside for the final time and was still right there after jumping the second last then gave way. MIDNIGHT MAN was through early and was no threat.
 ROYAL RUSE failed to menace. GET OUT OF TOWN was through early, started backing up and was eased and pulled up after the second last

 LAST SHANI settled mid pack until heading down the hill towards the second last jump, rallied after the second last coming up on the inside heading to the
 last and gaining the lead before that fence, jumped the last with authority and went on for the win. SUNSET DISTRICT was always within range of the
 leaders, rallied going down the hill to the second last to be right there with the two front runners jumping the last but could not gain further ground through
 the lane. JARIR (GB) was always close up, rallied going down the hill to the second last jump, jumped that head and head viaing for the lead, started to give
 way after that but was still close when he made a bad mistake jumping the last losing what momentum he had left but held on to the show spot. HOPPALA
 (IRE) settled towards the back, made a run after the second last but was not making much headway but finished with good energy and almost got up for the
 show spot. BARHANPOUR (FR) was up close, took command three jumps from home still had the lead at the second last then faded. BOSS MAN trailed
 throughout and was pulled up three jumps from home.

 LIFE SAID settled mid pack for the first mile and a half, quickly got in gear going down the hill heading for the second last, got the lead at that fence and
 then had clear advantage jumping the last and widened the margin from there. ACK FEISTY pressed the pace from the beginning, took over the lead
 heading down the hill going to the second last, but was over come and was no match for the hard charging winner but definitely second best here. INDY'S
 LEGACY was never far off the pace, and in striking distance jumping the second last, but was out run by the first two finishers. HANNO settled in the back,
 made a run going down the hill for the final time and finished with good energy over the rest. LADY YEATS (GB) raced towards the back and passed a tired
 rival in the late going. SAY NO MAUX had the lead for the first mile and a half, gave way and retreat. STORMY ALEX was in contention when he fell at the
 third last fence and walked off. CANAVERAL (GB) raced towards the back, then started to lose touch with the field and was pulled up before the third last
 jump.

 OVERWHELMING was happy settling in behind the two front runners who opened up on the field he reeled them in with a half a mile to go and took over
 the lead heading for the final turn and kept extending the margin. GOLD BRAID was all over the place during the early going and then was mid pack
 heading down the hill for the final turn with a lot of ground to make up, he closed with a rush once they got straightened away to take the second spot.
 KHAFAYYA (IRE) settled mid pack rallied down the hill to vied for the lead heading up the hill towards the final bend, no match for that rival but second was
 in the grasp until be overtaken in the final strides by a fast closing rival. CHOKLITCOVERDONUT was unrushed in the early going, started to get in gear
 heading down the hill, she had closed the gap heading into the straight but could not gain further ground. WILD DYNAFORMER trailed for about the first
 mile, made a run to get into contention heading into the stretch but failed to sustain bid. ANY GIVEN ROYAL though after a mile. SUPER BIRD never a
 factor. DELAWANA failed to menace. DIRECTOR (IRE) took command, stopped.
