 HOTFOOT settled off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked once straightened for the drive, tipped out a couple paths at the

 corner into the stretch, made a bid while asked at the three-sixteenths, fought along the rail in the final furlong and finished with good courage for the place.
 ALL BEHROOZED UP raced just off the pace on the outside, went four wide on the turn, made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, battled outside in the
 final furlong and just missed the place. I'M A LAWMAN contested the pace on the inside of MISTAKE PRESENT, vied in the two path on the turn, came
 under a drive in upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished. CARSON KAN raced just off the pace, went three wide on the turn, moved
 out behind horses near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. MISTAKE PRESENT moved up after the start, disputed the pace on the outside,
 vied in the three path on the turn and weakened. FEE DO settled on the outside, was forced six wide into the turn, dropped to the five path late on that bend
 and lacked the needed response. VITTORIOSO settled off the pace, was forced five wide into the turn, dropped to the four path late on that bend and failed
 to rally. TARPYS ZAPPER tossed his head along the rail early, tossed his head again nearing the turn then checked very sharply, dropped back fast while

 Footnotes
 QUEENOFTHEPALACE (NZ) went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, ranged up while three wide on the far turn, made an outside bid at the
 three-sixteenths, dueled with MARYBLUEEYES in the final furlong and proved best under good handling. ONEMOREFASTDANCE raced in the two path on
 the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out while put to a drive around the
 three-sixteenths and finished well to get the place. MARYBLUEEYES dropped to the inside entering the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace,
 responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under the whip in upper stretch, dueled with the winner in the final furlong and missed then lost the
 place at the wire. INDYPENDENT DEPUTY was unhurried on the inside, shifted to the two path while roused approaching the five-sixteenths then moved to
 the three path, swung five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the show. BACK PAGE STAR went four wide on the first turn, was
 reserved on the outside, tucked into the two path on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, held a good striking position into the final furlong but was
 out-kicked. URSULA ANDRESS (BRZ) raced in the two path on the first turn, tracked the pace, chased in the two path on the far turn and weakened. LA
 MAJESTIQUE rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was asked while swinging three wide into the
 stretch, moved out at the three-sixteenths and failed to rally. WHISPERING JUSTICE settled on the inside, was asked on the far turn, came under the whip
 in upper stretch and lacked the needed response.

 Footnotes
 TOO DIM angled in while settling off the pace, hugged the rail on the turn, gained while cutting the corner into the stretch, espied a seam between horses
 while roused coming to the furlong marker, rallied to the lead near the sixteenth-pole and proved best in an excellent ride. ZARBY'S DERBY DAY raced well
 back in the field, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out at the three-sixteenths, rallied to make a bid at the eighth-pole,
 battled with two rivals in the final sixteenth and missed while just able to get the place. MY BUDDY CHUCK was well placed just off the pace, came under
 urging while two then three wide on the turn, steadied briefly outside the quarter-pole, came four wide into the stretch, angled out at the three-sixteenths,
 rallied to make a bid at the furlong marker, battled with the top two in the final sixteenth and just missed the place. OUR RAPIDASH broke a step slow,
 settled near the back, went around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch, angled out near the three-sixteenths, gained into the final
 sixteenth but flattened out late while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. COPPER CAJUN disputed the pace between horses, vied in the two path on
 the turn, battled into the final furlong then weakened. WHY WEAR OLD SHOES contested the pace on the inside of several rivals, dropped back near the
 seven-sixteenths, chased inside on the turn, pursued the vanguard into the final furlong and tired. MADE TO FIT settled on the outside, was urged along
 while four then five wide on the turn, advanced to make an outside bid in upper stretch but came up empty. GENTLEMAN LEN was urged along off the
 pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. DANNY T was void of speed, went
 three to four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten then was vanned off after the race. RIVER PRIDE disputed the pace on
 the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, moved to the three path into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated.
 DARYLSLITTLEENGINE tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch but had nothing left for the final furlong.
