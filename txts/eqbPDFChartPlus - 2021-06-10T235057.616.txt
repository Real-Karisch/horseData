 Footnotes
 SCOFF chased the pace on the outside and rounded the turn in the four path, then drove down the lane under moderate handling to come up first in later
 yards. FLAME OF MY HEART hustled up to set the pace in about the three path, angled in past the five-sixteenths pole to round the turn on the rail, then
 dug in gamely in the stretch but was caught in later yards. WAY AHEAD OF YOU gave chase on the outside, rounded the turn in the five path, then gained
 down the stretch toward the outside and just lasted for third. OVERHEAR gave chase two wide between horses and was hemmed in at the heels of the
 pacesetter past the five-sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in about the three path, then dug in down the lane but just missed third. IDENTITY THEFT chased
 the pace from the inside and rounded the turn on the rail, then lacked room two deep down the stretch. ERMINE AND PURRS gave chase inside, took the
 turn off the rail, then angled out in the final sixteenth. AWE ZOOM gave chase on the outside and rounded the turn in the seven path, then swung out to
 about the eleven path leaving the turn and drifted out down the stretch.

 Footnotes
 IFURNOTFIRSTURLAST took the lead nearing the half mile pole then rated the pace, was pressured for more nearing the five sixteenths pole and dug in
 through the lane to just last. Shut off at the start, PURGATORY saved ground off the pace, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at
 the rail, eased to the two path leaving the turn, finished well and just missed. REATA'S CASTLE stalked the early pace then picked up the chase leaving the
 three eighths pole, rounded the turn in the four path though couldn't gain significantly down the lane. POTENTIAL GRIZZLY settled off the early pace
 outside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the five path, angled to the inside mid-stretch and finished evenly. STERLING CAESAR
 broke inward then stalked the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but faded through the turn. LITTLE BARI raced off the pace and was not a
 factor. ROAD TO DUBAI raced well back. SLICK MIKE showed little response after being steadied at the break.

 REWARD THE GYPSY hustled up to rate the pace on the outside through the first turn, then angled to the rail leaving that turn and increased her lead
 through the front stretch, was urged past the three-eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, then bore out through the turn, entering the lane in about
 the twelve path, and rallied down the stretch and held on well. CHERCHAZ LA FEMME broke in awkwardly at the start then rated off the pace inside at a
 distant second, eased out into the backstretch and made a bid at the three-eighths pole, took the far turn in the four path, then dug in down the stretch and
 finished evenly. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW rated well off the pace inside, rounded all turns on the rail, made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole, then came
 out a path in the stretch and just lasted for third. CAPTURE THE SUN broke a step slow and rated well back on the outside, made a bid approaching the
 three-eighths pole, improved through the turn on the outside in the six path, and finished evenly. BELLE NATION was steadied early after the break then
 rated off the pace on the inside, eased to the outside moving into the backstretch, made a bid near the three-eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four
 path, and leveled off late in the stretch. GEMINI DREAM rated off the pace two wide between horses and made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole, angled
 in to start the far turn on the rail but eased out to the four path through the turn and faded in the lane. ANNA LIFFEY broke a step slow and was never a
 factor. CHARITABLE ELLIE was through after a half.

 LET ME BE gave chase from the four path down the backstretch, left the turn three wide, dueled to the front mid-stretch, raced clear past the sixteenth pole
 and just lasted. NORTHERN HEAT chased the pace from the inside, raced boxed off the heels of Toy Queen nearing the head of the lane, angled three
 wide past the eighth pole, recovered stride mid-stretch to finish well and just missed. TOY QUEEN was hustled to the lead leaving the half mile pole then
 rated the pace toward the three eighths, came under pressure at the five sixteenths, was headed mid-stretch then flattened stride the final sixteenth.
 GATTOLOTTACHARM steadied early then picked up the chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the five path and finished evenly. DAKOTA MIST
 tapered in to give chase from the three and four paths, had aim at the quarter pole, started to fade approaching the head of the lane, steadied and angled
 four wide leaving the turn then weakened. BOLD LITTLE BABY chased the pace from the three path, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little further.
 KISS THE CAT FORME gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail and finished evenly. ANA VIRGINIA hesitated at the break, gave distant
 chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and finished evenly. ON THE HUNT became edgy in the gate and was outrun. SECRET

 Footnotes
 READY TO FIRE broke a step slow then was bumped by Sterling Rebel after the break, trailed early, then made a bid leaving the seven-sixteenths pole,
 improved through the backstretch on the inside, rounded the far turn on the rail, then eased to the outside leaving the turn and drove down the lane under
 moderate handling, quickly gaining and passing rivals, and came up first in the final strides. EL ORO rushed up and angled to the rail to rate the pace inside,
 rounded both turns on the rail, was urged past the quarter pole, but flattened stride in the final sixteenth and was caught near the wire. DANCING DENIS
 settled well off the pace in about the three path, made a bid approaching the three-eighths pole and took the far turn in the four path, then rallied down the
 stretch and finished evenly. MRHUNTSSILVER, saving ground into the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside, made a bid at the three-eighths pole and
 rounded the turn on the rail, but leveled off in the lane. STERLING REBEL broke in and bumped Ready to Fire at the start, then angled in through the front
 stretch and settled off the pace inside, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn on the rail, but weakened down the stretch. JUST
 TREY was never a factor. POZZUOLI saved ground into the first turn but showed little further. MARTIN MAN stalked the pace on the outside early but was
 through after a half.

 Footnotes
 KITE SURFER rated the pace inside, pulled clear past the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail rounding the far turn, drew clear again leaving
 the turn and held well under steady handling to late stretch. ALLEN JR. settled off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the
 far turn at the rail then dug in through the stretch to duel for second while unable to close on the winner. ONLY ROCK N ROLL rated off the pace in the
 three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead in the four path of the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
 SUNBRIDLED tapered in through the front stretch to stalk the pace in the three path, gave chase leaving the first turn, contested at a close disadvantage
 rounding the far turn but dropped back into the stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. MINI BOLT settled toward the back while saving ground, bid
 leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved his position in the four path of the far turn and finished evenly. CROSS ME AGAIN raced in the four and five
 paths the opening turn then settled well back leaving the turn, showed little response through the backstretch and could only pass tiring rivals. STOCK
 BROKER, off the pace in the two and three paths, bid mildly from the seven sixteenths pole. GREAT ROAD was not a factor while mostly saving ground.
 APPEALING GROOM hesitated then lunged at the break, angled to the inside and was not a factor.

 BRASS BULL was bumped at the start by Stickman Buck, then stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole and drew to near
 even terms past that pole, dueled through the turn in the three path and down the lane, taking the nod at the wire. SUPER ARTIST hustled up on the
 outside then angled to the rail going into the first turn to rate the pace inside, was urged at the three-eighths pole and was met at near even terms past the
 five-sixteenths, dueled through the turn on the rail and down the lane, and ceded at the wire. SIDEWALK PROPHET broke out and bumped Forbidden
 Topic at the start then eased out through the front stretch and settled well back on the outside, rounded the first turn in the six path and raced widest from
 there, made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole, then angled in to round the far turn in the four path, entered the head of the lane in the nine path, and
 finished widest. NOVA BOY ducked out and bumped into Siente El Viento at the start and settled off the pace three wide on the outside, made a bid past
 the five-sixteenths pole and took the far turn in the five path, then drifted out in the final sixteenth. SIENTE EL VIENTO was bumped at the start by Nova

 pole, but weakened in the turn. FORBIDDEN TOPIC broke out and bumped Stickman Buck, then was bumped by Sidewalk Prophet at the start, and was
 through early. STICKMAN BUCK broke out and bumped Brass Bull at the start and was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 KENLAKE RESORT settled back in the four and five paths and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the
 four path of the far turn, took over just inside the sixteenth pole and was drawing away through later yards. GLORIOUS VENEZUELA broke outward and
 stumbled shortly after the break, nearly unseating her rider, then settled back toward the inside, eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the seven
 sixteenths pole, angled six wide through the far turn and was along for second in the final yards. MIDNIGHT COWGIRL, off the pace toward the inside, bid
 leaving the half mile pole, raced five wide on the far turn and finished evenly. ICE BLUE VISION rated a slim early lead inside then yielded the advantage
 nearing the three quarter pole and stalked the pace from that point, recovered even terms past the three eighths, contested the edge at the rail rounding the
 far turn, dug in to turn back Jefferson Bop to mid-stretch but was caught by the winner at that point and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. JEFFERSON
 BOP stalked the early pace from the three path but took the lead nearing the three quarter pole, was met at even terms past the three eighths, dueled at a
 close disadvantage two deep rounding the far turn and continued a factor to mid-stretch before weakening. BAY DAWN raced off the pace in the three and
 four paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths, raced in range of the lead rounding the far turn then weakened from the top of the lane. CORY'S
 CUTIE rated close to the early pace off the rail, dropped back rounding the second turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail
 on the far turn then weakened in the lane. DYNAFLEET rated just off the pace in the three path then faded approaching the far turn. CHARISMATIC MISS
 was eased outward through the first turn and never factored. ARK ANGLE came away extremely rank and was pulled up immediately after the start.
