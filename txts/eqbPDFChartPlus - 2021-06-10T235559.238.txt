 HE COULD was never far off the pace, rallied around the second turn, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, dueled for the lead, inched clear near the
 sixteenth pole and held under pressure. LINEMANS CHECK raced mid pack, angled out along the backstretch, went seven wide leaving the turn, closed
 under strong left handed urging and was gaining late. BLANK IT vied two across, inched away for a short lead along the backstretch, responded when
 challenged to duel, yielded near the sixteenth pole and held for show. CHELOKEE'S LEGACY stalked the pace, challenged three across on the turn, dueled
 to deep stretch and hung. WED O'S CHAMP pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, fell back and leveled off. CANADIAN WARRIOR
 was rated back at the start, saved ground, offered a mild bid inside and did not threaten. EGOISTA raced in the back, went widest in the drive and improved
 position. PASCO was crowded and steadied along the backstretch, went eight wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. CRAFTY ME was outrun in an
 even effort. MONUMENTAL SEVEN vied inside, fell back along the backstretch to stalk, tired on the turn and stopped. The quarter mile fractional split was

 Footnotes
 MAMBOCELLO saved ground into the far turn, stayed inside for the drive and finished gamely to prevail. CHASKA bobbled slightly at the start, moved in on
 the clubhouse turn, raced just off the inside into the far turn and tracked the leader then finished gamely. TRILL POINT vied for the early lead inside, drew
 clear on the far turn and responded willingly in the drive then yielded grudgingly. SIX CIDER raced just off the inside turning for home, loomed a threat then
 was steadied behind a rival through the late stages. ELWOOD J never far back and four wide turning for home, lacked the needed stretch response.
 SUANCES SECRET raced up close early three wide and tired through the lane. MAJESTIC SPRING trailed then lacked the needed rally. BLAKE'S LUCKY
 STAR had no rally. MR DEJAVU raced near the inside on the far turn and lacked a bid. DUDE'S DUDE vied early and weakened nearing the top of the lane.

 DYNAMIC RESPONSE moved up along the backstretch to contend, fell back entering the stretch, closed steadily, got a head in front near the sixteenth pole
 and was all out at the wire. THREE PADRES was hustled along, stalked the pace, bid six wide, closed steadily and gained late. CALL IT LUKE was void of
 early speed, went eight wide entering the stretch, found his best stride late and got up for show. RONTON was sent to the front, contended to the second
 turn, inched away for a short lead entering the stretch and faltered near the sixteenth pole. MUSIC GIANT raced close to the pace while racing outside, went
 seven wide leaving the turn and lacked a late rally. RAGS TO RAGS was never far back, bid inside and came up empty. ARTAKSEZ bumped at the start
 and failed to threaten in an even effort. OOPPER WALLAH bumped at the start, advanced to the second turn and flattened out. CASA O had brief speed
 only.

 bumped between rivals at the start, raced near the rail turning for home, was between foes inside the eighth pole then needed more. EASY SWITCH broke
 out, saved ground and raced up close on the turn then weakened in the drive. DANGERSMYMIDDLNAME between foes early, raced in the five path into the
 lane and lacked a bid. MUY BUENO also between rivals early, weakened on the turn. ARIZONA SUN came in at the start, trailed into the turn while racing

 Footnotes
 SPOOKY CHANNEL was never far off the pace, rallied three across into the final turn, dueled to the wire and proved best in a long drive. STRATTON
 moved up inside entering the final turn, dueled for the lead and was outfinished in a game effort. ARIZONA MOON raced close to the pace, challenged
 between horses entering the turn, dueled to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. MOST DETERMINED showed speed to the final turn, tired and dropped
 back. TALLY STICK raced mid pack in an even effort and did not threaten. ONE STOP SHOP was not a factor. ROYAL BRIAR was outrun. KATZUMOTO
 failed to contend. PACIFIC NIGHTS failed to contend. REBELLIOUS DIANA set the pace with a clear lead, tired into the final turn and stopped.
