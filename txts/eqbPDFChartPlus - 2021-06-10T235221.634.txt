 Footnotes
 RAPPAKUBA set a pressured pace, maintained a safe lead while racing in the three path throughout and drew off as an easy winner. DOMESDAY GAL
 was allowed to settle early, went four wide into the turn angled out in early stretch, was no match for the winner and finished second best. ACUTE LIL
 DEVIL chased the early pace, ranged up five wide into the turn and was empty in the drive. LOVE BUG WHO was void of any early speed, circled seven
 wide through the turn and offered no late rally. A KISS FOR MOM was taken back early, went six wide into the turn and never fired. BLAZE TO GLORY
 stalked the early pace, raced along the inside and gave way. SUMMER RUNNER was outrun early and had no impact on the finish. JS LUCKY CHARM
 was never a factor.

 into the turn and was empty late. DANCES FOR KAMIA raced in mid pack early, raced along the inside into the turn and tired. ALMOSTEVENWITHEVAN
 was unhurried early, went five wide into the turn and offered no late rally. ARTIC CRUSH was taken back early, raced between rivals and never fired.

 LEFT TRAIN was not far back early, swung out six wide through the turn, was gaining late and was up in time for the win. MULBERRY attended the early
 pace, went four wide into the turn, opened up in mid stretch and was tagged in the last strides. AMERICAN PROUD tracked the early pace, advanced five
 wide into the turn and finished empty late. SOUTH WIMBLEDON set a pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the turn and gave way. WICKED
 PERTY was void of any early speed, circled seven wide through the turn and offered no late rally. OFF THE SCREEN was outrun early, raced between
 rivals into the turn and never fired. GAMBLERS ODYSSEY was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside and weakened. DEVIL'S WILDCAT was
 unhurried early and had no impact on the finish. SPLIT STEP was never a factor and was vanned off.
