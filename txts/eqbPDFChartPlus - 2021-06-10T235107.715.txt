 Footnotes
 NO TRAFFIC made the lead shortly after the start, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best. LITTLE TODD
 chased the winner all the way and finished well clear for second. ANOTHER EXPERIENCE stalked the pace into the far turn then faded. STUDY HABITS
 passed tiring rivals. GRAB A HANDFUL lacked the needed response. R DANCESONLYCHANCE was no threat. FLIP OVER ME had brief speed, stopped
 before a half, lost contact with his field and was distanced.

 Footnotes
 GUNSHIP vied for the lead along the inside, slipped through to contest the lead before a half, battled into the stretch and shook clear under brisk handling.
 FLYING GHOST never far back, had a mild late rally and finished second best. CLASSIC DANIEL angled out to the three path on the clubhouse turn,
 stalked the pace and went evenly. WILKO FREEWAY failed to menace. CHASING THE STARS away alertly, set the pace off the rail in the two path for a
 little over a half, battled with the winner into the stretch then weakened. MENACING was no factor.

 ground. WOELF DEN broke well, set a pressured pace fro nearly six furlongs then folded in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 HIDATSA PARK trailed briefly, responded readily when set down, circled her field on the turn, made the lead in deep stretch and won going away. VILARO
 bumped at the start, set the pace into the stretch and finished gamely second best. FLAT OUT SUPER pressed the pace into the turn, rallied three wide in
 upper stretch, put a head on front before the furlong marker then was outfinished in a determined effort. TANGO LIMA stalked the pace from the inside into
 the stretch, loomed boldly along the rail before the furlong marker then was outfinished. WENDY PEFFERCORN failed to respond. DOTTHEI close up four
 wide, lacked the needed response. KYLES MARIGOLD bumped at the start, dropped back then trailed.
