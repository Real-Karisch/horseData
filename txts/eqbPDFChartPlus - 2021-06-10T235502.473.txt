 Footnotes
 TENGS WONDER bumped both sides leaving the gate, shook off the exchange to quickly clear the field, led uncontested into the drive and drew off under
 hand urging. WIN WIN broke in at the start, stalked two wide around the turn, could not make an impact on the winner and held the place. AFFIRMATIVE
 JANE broke in and received bumps from both sides at the start, tracked the pacesetter early, angled in entering the turn and saved ground to the lane, then
 finished evenly in the late stages. CALI ROCKS bumped both sides away from the gate, raced off the pace near the inside, two wide around the turn and
 never rallied. KATHIA bumped by rival at the start, raced off the rail, three to four wide nearing the eighth pole and proved no menace. FIRST STREET
 broke out, bumped rival at the start, raced along the inside, moved over into the two path and was never a factor.
