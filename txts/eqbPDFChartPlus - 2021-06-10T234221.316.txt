 Footnotes
 WIMBLEDON'S KISS broke back, advanced outside to challenge midway on the turn, dueled into the stretch, drew clear the final furlong under steady
 handling. CAJUN CATIN with the early pace in the three path, dueled inside the winner into the stretch, proved no match late, clearly second best. LITTLE
 KATRINA vied up front while between foes early, fell back off the top two midway on the bend, continued to fade off that pair through the stretch, narrowly
 retained the show by gaining the nod. FLASH MEDIA void of speed for three furlongs, roused for the drive, found best stride too late, narrowly missed the
 show. BROKE AND PRAYING flashed some early speed along the inside, faded.

 Footnotes
 UPTOWN RULER broke alertly, forwardly placed into the first turn, fell back in the run up the backstretch, stalked then advanced into the lane, engaged the
 leader soon after, edged clear. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE void of speed, advanced toward the inside into the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch,
 finished willingly to be up for the place in the final stride. NEON SKY away in good order, narrowly set the pace off the inside, disposed of the other speed
 turning into the stretch, briefly offered resistance when the winner came alongside midstretch then could not keep up, nipped late for the place. ARCTIC
 JOY ducked in at the start, lacked speed in trailing for a half, improved through some traffic into the lane, flattened out in the late going. I'M D'CAT settled in
 mid pack early, continued one paced in lacking a closing response. AND YET ANOTHER off a step slow, failed to menace. DREWZANO forwardly placed
 for five furlongs, faded in the drive. SOLID RED pressed the issue from along the inside for five furlongs, gave way in the drive.

 KENTUCKY STEAL broke with the field, forward early, fell back inside entering the turn, moved out for the drive, closed with a flourish to be up in time.
 TORTUGA RIO broke sharp, dueled up front closest to the inside, shook clear with a furlong remaining, led late, could not contain the winner, clear of the
 others. CHERYL'S COPY last to leave, advanced three wide to challenge late in the turn, came in slightly, brushed upper stretch, proved no match for the
 top two the final furlong, finished up best of the rest. SHOW'EM THE HEAT away in good order, alternated up front for a half outside the runner up, brushed
 while between rivals when straightened for home, weakened. APRIL MAE fell back to trail after the start, swung four wide exiting the turn, came up empty
 for the run to the wire.

 Footnotes
 ROYAL ROCKET broke a step behind the field, continued to lag in lacking speed, came three wide out of the final turn when beginning to move, split foes
 late when rallying smartly, up in the final strides. BUSHIDO SAMURAI dueled up front closest to the inside through some leisurely splits, continued to vie
 past the furlong marker, led late, proved stubborn to the end. MY FIRST GUITAR in the second flight outside, moved closer in the three path midway on the
 final turn, lost some ground into the lane, got back to the first flight past the furlong marker, not enough in the late going. HANDSOME HARVE in the second
 group toward the inside, angled out to be four wide into the lane, also failed to deliver a closing punch. IRON GRIP broke on top, dueled through the soft
 fractions off the inside, vied between foes midstretch, weakened. ABSOLUT NEWORLEANS forwardly placed in the early going, began a gradual fade after
 a half.

 Footnotes
 SKEETER away in good order, helped set a soft pace along the inside, headed far turn, battled back while continuing along the inside stretch to narrowly
 prevail in game fashion. BEST GUESS four wide in the first turn, advanced with an early move on the outside onto the backstretch, vied into the second
 turn, showed the way into the lane in garnering a slightly larger advantage, outkicked in the late going. CELTIC LASS prompted the pace off the inside and
 three wide, asked along far turn, lacked the necessary closing response in the drive. COSTA SUGAR forwardly placed just off the inside, pulled while
 remaining in the two path backstretch, came up empty when called on for the drive. PURELY BLESSED pressured the pace while four wide early in the first
 turn, continued to vie in the run up the backstretch, began to weaken in the second turn. SUPERSTITIOUS SWAN last to leave, remained always back in
 failing to threaten.

 DAD SAID NO broke out slightly, raced back off the pace toward the inside, moved closer from between horses into the turn, vied entering the stretch, long
 drive, proved best while fully extended. TYLERS BANDIT last away, trailed up the backstretch, closer turning for home, steadied slightly in traffic upper
 stretch, dropped inside for room, bid inside the winner, clear second. HE'S NO BULLY in a bit tight at the start, behind the pace, four wide when moving to
 the fore turning for home, drifted out past the furlong marker, made a mild close on the top two while remaining well out in the strip. GOLDEN ARGUMENT
 in the second flight off the inside, remained in the two path when chasing early in the turn, came on the inside when advancing out of the turn, flattened out
 in the drive. REAL TIME broke alertly, sprinted well clear, continued to hold a sizable advantage into the turn, gave way readily when confronted for the
 drive. D'WILDSUMMERSFUN chased the leader early, stopped in the drive.

 after, fell back, saved ground into far turn, moved out, three wide bid into the straight, drove clear. MR. BIG CITY broke on top, tracked the two leaders first
 turn, moved out and lodged a three wide bid before a half, dueled into and through the final turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch between horses
 and inside the winner, no match for that rival late, remained clear for the second spot. COURAGEOUSLUKE moved up to duel with the winner early in the
 two path, hooked up with the runner up before a half, vied into the lane inside the top two, comfortably saved the show. LOOKIN STRONG fractious in the
 gate, settled in mid pack, lacked a closing response. CAPTAINONTHEROCKS last to leave, trailed for over a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while
 not a threat. CLASSIC HEATH settled off the pace, had little for the drive. ROSS was finished after a half.

 Footnotes
 BIG RED ROSE broke with the field, allowed the speed to go early, began a steady gain after a half three wide, took over entering the stretch, quickly kicked
 clear under steady handling. MY LITTLE ROSY forwardly placed, lost some position in the second turn, angled out four wide into the straight, proved no
 match for the winner the final furlong, clear for the place. MICHEL IT'S AUTUM settled off the pace while toward the inside, steered out to be four wide
 turning for home, showed some late interest to be well clear for the show. CRY LIKE A BABY went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response.
 DUEPEG checked up in some traffic into the first turn, raced back, fanned five wide into the lane, managed little in the way of a late rally. NAVY REGATTA
 lacked speed, fanned out six wide exiting the final turn, failed to muster a rally. SOUTHERN DUDETTE chased the leader off the inside, took over midway
 on the final turn, gave way when headed by the winner entering the stretch. SCARLET'S CAUSEWAY broke alertly, got clear to set the early pace inside,
 stopped in the second turn. AUNT BAE BAE in some traffic when near the back into the first turn, was finished after a half, far back.
