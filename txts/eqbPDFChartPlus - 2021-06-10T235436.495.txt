 Footnotes
 BOSSYATTA set the uncontested pace posting soft fractions on top, opened up on rest of the field and kept on under steady encouragement. VENTINA
 raced in range then steadied sharply three eighths pole, hustled up three wide in the drive, could not get to clear lead while clear for place. ATHERA was
 taken under snug hold to race near the back while soft fractions being set on top, roused five to six wide entering the lane, continued steady bid to gain
 share. QUEENS QUARTERS raced midpack just off inside, angled out path three eighths pole then hustled up three to four wide in lane, just missed show.
 NATRONA GIRL steadied in the first turn then stalked through the backstretch, launched bid for pulling away BOSSYATTA in far turn then failed to sustain
 bid in the lane. GIO PATRICIA raced near the lead leaving the first turn then taken up and steadied back awkwardly to last, shifted to outside and moved
 back up in range then began to weaken mid-way through far turn, drifted out few paths and offered no late run. BELLA SUNRISE tracked the early pace
 then retreated three furlongs out. DR. COTTON JEN showed little.

 Footnotes
 RIBERENA raced in contention bit tight along rail in the backstretch, angled out couple paths, raced off top trio in the turn, given cue turning for home then
 roused forward to match strides with PRINCESS KNOLL in final sixteenth, edged away under driving finish. PRINCESS KNOLL raced up close then made
 move leaving the half mile marker, dueled between then along inside of POOPSIE DOOPSIE, shook free upper stretch, fought back gamely when
 challenged by eventual winner in late drive, lacked a closing kick. POOPSIE DOOPSIE roused forward leaving the backstretch to duel three deep for the
 lead, kept on along outside of PRINCESS KNOLL turning for home then failed to match strides but kept along in steady pursuit. GRAND EDGE raced
 mid-range then roused along outside in turn then finished evenly. BEAUTIFUL ALLY raced in close range opening quarter pole then steadily lost ground
 racing wide in turn and into stretch. SOFT AND SILENT came away step slow at the start, hustled up between rivals gaining contending position then failed
 to sustain bid midway through far turn. STAR BABY saved ground while interest along the rail in early stages, failed to advance when called upon then
 steadily weakened. SASSY SLEW sped to the lead, continued on top leaving the backstretch then failed to keep pace midway through turn. GOLDEN MILA
 showed little.

 ANOTHER SOFTBALL pulled while keen entering the backstretch, steadied then eventually settled into stalking position along the inside, angled out couple
 paths in far turn and headed in pursuit, shaken up three to four wide in the drive, produced solid bid for second best. STORYBOOK SECRET was rated
 along rail near mid-range going through the backstretch, gained along clear rail in the far turn, switched out driving five wide, gain and cleared share.
 ANDREW THE BULL stalked through the backstretch then hustled up in the far turn, came out wide entering drive then weakened. SHOOTIST got pinched

 sustain bid through far turn. NATION U S A raced off early pace, roused along rail entering the lane then lacked needed rally for impact. DISTINCTLY

 Footnotes
 FLEMISH CAP was well placed sitting off top pair, roused up three path to challenge for lead at the quarter pole, dueled into upper stretch then took
 command and held firm. RED CRESCENT was rated five then four wide going through the backstretch, moved up in four path to duel for lead late in turn,
 dug in turning for home, could not match strides for the win but continued solid bid for runner up spot. WOODBURN dueled for the lead racing outside of
 GEH SCHNELL through the backstretch, took on added challengers in turn, fought back into haed of the lane then lacked needed more in reserve to move
 on. SIR HANNOUN saved ground along inside, lacked racing room late in turn, swung out wide entering the drive then evened out. GEH SCHNELL dueled
 along inside through the backstretch and into the lane then retreated while tired. PAPA PIG trailed the field and failed to rally. Race was hand timed

 Footnotes
 SUN OF TARA settled back off early pace, quickly circled around rivals in far turn to take command, drew off under steady encouragement, continued to
 widen while ridden out in late stages. OSCURA was fractious in the gate then remained unhurried near the back, responded when called upon in far turn,
 raced three to five wide in the lane, no match for winner, cleared second best. EXTRAVAGANT BABY raced midpack going through the backstretch then
 began to move up closer, steadied in the far turn then sent driving into the lane, continued steady even bid and gained position. ARC ANGEL floated out in
 first turn then settled into stalking position positioned off top pair, made move three furlongs out, dueled for lead at the quarter pole then flattened out in the
 drive, finished far ahead over the rest. XANADU EXPRESS trailed in the back then moved by tiring rivals in the lane. DUDICIOUS dueled along inside of
 SHES A HEAD TURNER in first turn and throughout the backstretch, took slight edge entering far turn, took on added challengers but had no kick left in
 reserve to move on. SHES A HEAD TURNER dueled along outside of DUDICIOUS throughout the backstretch then retreated in far turn. LADY ALONDRA
 had nothing left after the half. Run up distance unavailable

 I'M JUST SOUPER saved ground racing off well clear pacesetter running through the backstretch, responded willingly when asked and quickly gained
 inside to take lead turning for home, came out few paths and kept on under driving finish. CONSCIOUS DECISION was unhurried racing near the back,
 saved ground along the inside, took closer order then roused along rail at the quarter pole, switched out five wide for the drive, produced solid finish for
 runner up spot. REGAL FORCE settled back off pace, circled outside in the far turn then carried out very wide entering top stretch, lost ground then finished
 well. EL CICLON was nearest pursuer off well clear pacesetter, hustled up two wide between rivals at the quarter pole, continued steady even bid to the
 end. LASSELL closed the gap on clear leader in the far turn, fanned six wide approaching top stretch, kept on but lacked needed kick for late impact.
 TELLING TONY saved ground then hustled up along rail entering lane, gained position to race off top pair but failed to sustain bid and flattened out.
 DARNELLS SPIRIT settled five wide going through the backstretch, came out very wide entering the drive, gained some ground but needed more for
 impact. VALOORDO was unhurried racing near the back, put to a drive three to four wide at head of the lane then lacked needed rally. ABTAAL raced in the
 back, saved ground and roused along rail entering lane, lacked needed response to gain close range. FIFTH AVENUE FLASH sped to early lead, drew off
 on top racing wide and continued to widen advantage, drew off from the field then collared in the far turn and had nothing left in the lane.

 wire to capture place. PACHANGA PARTY sped to the lead then moved away on top to clear lead, got collared in late drive then lost place at the wire.
 BANCO DINERO lacked early speed then angled to rail top stretch, produced good kick up inside, gaining to the wire. STARSHIP APACHE was reserved
 racing near the back, continued back and wide entering the lane the finished with good kick. INDIANA COWBOY picked up the pace in turn, roused six wide
 at eighth pole, gained position but needed more to threaten late leaders. SPURS N BOWS settled back in early stages, gained position along inside, came
 out two to three wide in upper stretch then flattened out. BIG BOY BRUNO was reserved and wide going through the backstretch, moved out wider at head
 of the lane and passed tiring rivals. ZACHARY'S PITCH raced midpack through the backstretch, weakened in turn then offered no late run. KEEP ME
