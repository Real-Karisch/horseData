 C J TERROR dueled outside PUT IT THERE for the lead, three wide around the turn, battled down the stretch and edged rival for the victory. PUT IT
 THERE dueled from the inside, two wide into the lane, fought gamely in the late stages but was outfinished. MILITANT bumped leaving the gate, stalked the
 pace from the inside, bid along the rail leaving the turn but weakened past the sixteenth pole. LUCKY COTTON bumped at the start, tracked the top pair
 from off the rail, two to three wide around the turn and could not summon the needed rally. TORRE ITALIANA saved ground into the lane and was never a
