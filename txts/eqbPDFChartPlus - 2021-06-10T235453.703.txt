 weakened and held the show. ACROBAT mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the lane and weakened. IRISH MAIL allowed

 DANCE OR STROLL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear
 late. NAUT A GIVER stalked the early pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then lacked the needed late kick. LITTLE MISS MAY well
 placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the land weakened the final furlong. QUEENOFTHEKINGDOM
 broke a step slowly from the gate and was never involved. BLACK IS BACK set the pace on the inside and faded in the drive.
