 BELLA BE READY was unhurried while wide, rallied willingly through the stretch and drew clear late under strong urging. TEXAS MUSIC pressed the pace,
 inherited the lead in the upper stretch and failed to stay. MADAME X. trailed to the stretch, came widest and had a big run. MAGICAL MYSTOFALES raced
 near the back of the pack, rallied inside to the middle of the stretch, was taken up and angled out behind JAY WOW and finished well. JAY WOW saved
 ground to the stretch, angled out into the two-path, suddenly swerved to the rail putting MAGICAL MYSTOFALES in danger and lacked a rally. A NEW
 ANGEL stalked the pace to the final furlong and tired. MA DE TAW was well placed and tired. SAUCY SYMPHONY quickly took command, led into the
