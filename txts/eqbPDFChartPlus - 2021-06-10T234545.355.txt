 Footnotes
 ALMANAAR (GB) settled under a firm hold three wide in mid pack, remained patiently handled until put to coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, angled six
 wide at the head of the stretch, offered up a good kick under a mild hand ride to issue a challenge inside the final furlong and take command a sixteenth
 from home, then held off a late surging rival while under a hand ride to the finish. TICONDEROGA unhurried just off the inside near the tail of the field, came
 under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide at the quarter pole, offered up good energy to surge belatedly inside but was ultimately staved off by
 the top one while safe for the place honors. AQUAPHOBIA allowed to settle two to three wide in mid pack, remained rated until put to urging with
 five-sixteenths to run, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the furlong grounds, then got outfinished in the late stages while safe for
 the show honors. STICKSSTATELYDUDE raced forwardly placed along the inside out of the dog legged chute into the backstretch and was placed to rating
 and eased off as GO AROUND ranged up to the outside taking command and taking to the inside, grew rank and headstrong under the rider tossing his
 head briefly, got guided to the three path five furlongs from home, chased three wide from that point onward, came under coaxing three furlongs out,
 continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. KING KREESA off half a beat slow, ranged
 up to take over command into the backstretch and showed the way in hand from the two path until tucked inside nearing the far turn, came under coaxing
 under pressure for the initial time at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in inching away to the eighth pole under growing threat to the
 outside, got collared a sixteenth out and weakened in the late going. SYCAMORE LANE forwardly placed three then two wide in aim of the leader, came
 under a ride five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. GO AROUND ranged up to lead briefly early on
 before conceding the front to track the leader along the inside in the pocket using the cover of that rival, remained patiently handled until nearing the quarter
 pole, cut the corner roused into upper stretch and weakened. GLENVILLE GARDENS broke inwards brushing the near side stall at the start, raced sluggish
 early nearly propping a sixteenth into the race before being urged to carry on by the rider, advanced four wide down the backstretch from the five-eighths
 despite a hard hold and ranged up to mid pack, came under coaxing into the far turn, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

 Footnotes
 STONEFACTOR away the quickest by a narrow margin, maintained the advantage, cut over to the inside, got rated showing the way, prompting by the
 second place finisher to the outside, spun into the lane still tailed by the nemesis, was let loose when challenged coming up to the eighth pole, dug in with
 good determination to preserve the decision. LULU'S POM POM secured a forward position after an alert getaway, pulled on the right a bit stalking the
 winner during the initial stages, stepped into the lane, was deep into the furlong grounds before being its cue, finished willingly but was staved off. MAMA
 MARY took up the chase from path two in between rivals, rated and within striking distance for the opening half, was kept on hold lacking suitable options
 from the end of the bend to the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, was called upon for more leaving that station, tipped to be outside the top
 twosome a few strides, came home with good energy en route for the show. SHANGHAI DREAMS departed the backstretch from the two path, picked up
 interest at the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out wider and wider after entering the stretch, wound up seven wide when done, finished with good energy down
 the center of the course to earn the last major check. BARREL OF DESTINY worked out a tuck along the inside before arriving at the conclusion of the
 backstretch, was kept on hold idling behind rivals for a sixteenth, beginning from the quarter pole, inched her way to the outside and was called upon, made
 some headway, with only minor spoils to show for the effort. CAITRIONA two wide entering the turn, was driven into path five from upper to midlane,
 straightened away, lacked the needed late response. UNPARALLELED quickly set up in the pocket, cut the corner under a hand drive, failed to muster up a
 solid offering and weakened. FANCYCASE along the inside route by the half mile pole, was urged angling four wide into the stretch, made no impact.
 CARRERA CAT pursued the front runners three wide on the turn, was slightly wider at the head of the stretch, gave way. SUNDANCE JOY three wide
 heading onto the turn, was let out a notch at the five-sixteenths marker, swung six wide into the lane, failed to make its presence felt. GILDA MARIE
 propped after leaping hard into the right side of the starting gate, saved ground for the majority of the opening half, was under encouragement getting
 worked into path three during the early stages of the stretch run, had no rally. FREDERICA strung out four wide and pulling hard on the right at the
 three-eighths pole, displayed only brief speed. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the start the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared
 official.

 Footnotes
 LEWIS BAY bobbled at the break recovering outwards which in turn made CAIRENN shy outwards, prompted the pace of DIVINE MISS GREY from the
 outside four then three wide through the turn in hand, took over narrow command at the five-sixteenths patiently handled, got set down spinning just off the
 inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. HIGHWAY STAR four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got leaned on briefly
 three furlongs from home as AMERICAN GAL attempted to nudge her way out from in behind the top pair, denied the move holding her rightful lane, came
 under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, couldn't match the top one through the final eighth while keeping on safe to
 secure the place honors. CAIRENN shied out at the start half a path in reaction to LEWIS BAY recovering outwards from a bobble, crossed to chased just
 off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
 stretch, then tipped out four to five wide straightened away and improved position to garner the show honors. DIVINE MISS GREY cut the pace three then
 two wide under some pressure from LEWIS BAY to the outside through solid splits coming under light coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, got headed
 for command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home shaken off a bit and weakened in the final furlong. AMERICAN GAL brushed the off
 side stall at the start when breaking outwards a step and conceded only a length and a half to two lengths to the front, raced three wide under rating in close
 range of the front, attempted to nudge her way out from in behind the top pair leaning on HIGHWAY STAR at the three-eighths and was denied the move as
 that rival held firm to her lane, tipped out four to five wide into upper stretch after HIGHWAY STAR cleared outside briefly roused, came up empty and was
 not persevered with through the final furlong.

 Footnotes
 SANDY'Z SLEW lightly urged for the first few strides, cut over to the inside after having established control, carved out the pace attended by a pair of foes
 parked out two and three wide respectively, began to edge away late on the bend, was already comfortably in the clear when cued up approaching the
 eighth pole, had no difficulty holding ABIDING STAR at bay in the final furlong. ABIDING STAR away the tardiest after hip-checking the left side of the
 starting gate, underwent a two to three pursuit on the turn, was put to a drive spinning five wide into the lane, lugged in during the going from the
 three-sixteenths pole to the furlong marker, ultimately affecting two others, those being EXPECTED RULER and SPRING TO THE SKY, continued to
 wander into path two before assuming a truer course, proved no match yet finished in a willing manner for the place nevertheless. EXPECTED RULER
 quickly placed on the hedge, picked up interest as the half was being completed, was tipped into three path after stepping into the lane, paused in hand in
 the general area of the eighth pole, due to pressure coming from the second place finisher, got going again soon afterwards and rallied for the show.
 DOWSE'S BEACH in the three path, vied as the widest of three for the opening half before giving way. SPRING TO THE SKY three wide departing the
 backstretch, drafted behind DOWSE'S BEACH during the run around the end, spun one path wider into the stretch, was pushed inward by the runner up
 early during the stretch run, eventually winding up being pinched, failed to regain any interest. BLESSED HALO broke through the gate, was kept control of
 by the gate crew member and didn't run off, proceeded to come away without apparent mishap once the field was sent on its way, pressed the issue from
 the two path in between rivals for the opening half, made it into the stretch and gave way. PHI BETA EXPRESS patiently ridden riding the rail, had already
 retreated when roused stepping into the lane, remained the trailer.

 Footnotes
 OUR BRAINTRUST chased along the inside coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in behind the leader,
 angled inside nearing the eighth pole, offered up a good finish inside to take command seventy yards from home and inched away to the wire. SOMBEYAY
 stumbled at the start getting away three lengths slow, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the nine-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch,
 angled out three wide at the three-sixteenths and closed well to secure the place honors in the final jumps. MAE NEVER NO (IRE) chased three to four wide
 in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing three furlongs out and advancing to issue a challenge through the latter portion of the turn, took over
 command swinging three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, inched away under a drive to midstretch, dug in under growing late threat from
 a trio and was overwhelmed in the final seventy yards growing a bit leg weary while just preserving the show honors. SIR TRUEBADOUR bumped at the
 start by GIRLS LOVE ME who broke outwards, chased four wide early on until tucked to be two to three wide at the seven-sixteenths, came under urging
 near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close belatedly. OUTSHINE broke in at the start under hustling,
 chased just off the inside until tipped to the four path half a mile from home put to urging, continued four wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
 GIRLS LOVE ME broke out at the start bumping SIR TRUEBADOUR, chased three wide early on before floating out five to six wide through the turn under
 coaxing from the three-eighths, continued in the overland route into upper stretch and made no impact. SOCIAL FAN hustled from the gate, showed the way
 in hand from just off the inside until tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing three furlongs out under growing pressure to the outside,
 got headed nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened.

 Footnotes
 FIXEDINCOME LARRY made contact with the right side of the starting gate as the field was being sent on its way, took up position in the two path, loosely
 drafted behind the pacesetter making its way on the turn, was asked for more after stepping into the lane, was forced to steady when the passageway along
 its path momentarily tightened in midstretch, had it widen slightly but enough to be of use in short order, responded when given his cue and burst through
 between rivals, grabbed away the advantage about a sixteenth later and edged away. THROW THE FADE well off the inside throughout, sat parked along
 the overland route on the turn, was called upon for more challenging in earnest towards path five in upper stretch, arrived at the eighth pole, looming boldly
 with good momentum, battled onward with good energy for the place. ENCINITAS strung out five wide, contended as the widest of a quartet late on the turn,
 got turned loose heading home, kept up its pursuit for the next eighth before backing away. ORBED sat well rated in the pocketed, picked it up when
 switched over to light hand encouragement leaving the midway point on the turn, shoe-horned itself into path two, appeared to be leading the field into the
 lane by a slim margin when put to a drive, came under heavy pressure in midlane, relinquished soon afterwards and weakened. SUPPORT OUR CAUSE
 away two lengths slower than any other, tucked along the rail well before leaving the backstretch, picked up speed vacating the premises after the half had
 been completed, gradually moved five wide during its stretch run, made no impact. I'M AMAZING pursued the front runners from path two, was urged four
 wide into upper stretch, had no rally. LUNAR PHASE gained control shortly after the start, was well rated in the two path showing the way, came under
 intensified pressure after going a half, chased by a threesome to the outside, yielded at the quarter pole under a drive, then steadily backed away.
 FALLSTAR disputed the pace mostly four wide to the five-sixteenths marker and gave way.

 RAGING BULL (FR) settled four wide in mid pack, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a good kick
 to issue a challenge through the final eighth being brought inside to the three path to get a good look at the leader, seized command seventy yards from
 home and inched away to the finish to prevail. MORRISON hustled from the gate, got coaxed to the front into the backstretch and showed the way in hand
 from just off the inside patiently handled and settled into a comfortable rhythm, showed the way through swift splits, came under growing threat nearing the
 quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, got roused with three-sixteenths to go, inched away to a safe lead a furlong out before digging in under threat
 to the finish, got caught seventy yards from home while safe for the place honors. PENALTY broke in at the start bumping PRIORITIZE, chased along the
 inside before taking to the two path through the far turn, swung three wide into upper stretch, got bumped nearing the eighth pole placed to a drive as
 THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN tipped out and in turn bumped TRUMPI into HAVE AT IT, then ran on to improve position and procure the show honors on the
 wire. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN just off the inside just off the pace behind the cover of ALMITHMAAR early on, tucked inside into loose cover behind the
 leader three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out nearing the eighth pole and bumped PENALTY into TRUMPI and in
 turn HAVE AT IT, then kept on and missed for the show honors. ALMITHMAAR tracked inside early on behind the cover of the leader before tipping out to
 the two path into the clear six furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths advancing to latch on the leader before swinging three wide
 into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. PRIORITIZE bumped at the start by PENALTY who broke inwards, saved ground
 near the rear of the field, came under a ride three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and improved position through the drive with a mild
 bid. ZAP DADDY three to four wide near the rear, came under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, angled six wide into upper stretch following the
 eventual winner and offered no response. WAR CHEST three wide in mid pack, came under coaxing briefly tucked just off the inside at the three-eighths,
 angled four to five wide at the quarter pole and offered no response. HAVE AT IT two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled
 until set down angled five wide at the head of the stretch, dug in under drive and was bumped near the eighth pole in a chain of bumps begun by
 THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN tipping out, then weakened through to the finish. TRUMPI just off the pace two to three wide, came under motivation with
 five-sixteenths remaining, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in between foes and was bumped nearing the eighth plole by PENALTY due to pressure
 from THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN and in turn bumped HAVE AT IT, then weakened through to the wire. INFIELD IS IN chased four then three wide from near
 the rear coaxed along from midway on the far turn, swung three wide at the quarter pole, made no impact.

 Footnotes
 IMPERIAL HINT guided over towards the inside after the start, loosely drafted behind the pacesetter for a portion of the journey on the backstretch, tipped
 out into path three after stepping onto the turn, sat perched, keeping watch on the front runners, ranged up after the half had been run, enough so as to spin
 into the lane on near even terms with BOBBY ABU DHABI, was called upon a sixteenth down the road as a duel ignited between them, began the final
 furlong having fought its way past a determined opponent, edged away to lead by a short length at the most, felt the presence of WHITMORE in the final
 stages, but dug in resolutely to prevail. WHITMORE away last, was gradually worked onto the inside route making his way towards the half mile pole, was in
 hand scurrying into contention with a sustained rail run on the turn, got switched over to a hand ride slithering four wide, the second widest of all, into the
 lane, maintained the momentum after being straightened away, finished with good belated energy but came up short. BOBBY ABU DHABI broke in line with
 RECRUITING READY, was allowed to ease back into a stalking role, prompted the previously-mentioned rival on the turn, displaced that foe, but only
 narrowly, coming up to the quarter pole, got called upon at that station, relinquished reluctantly after vying with vigor against the winner during the ensuing
 furlong, still had some fight left afterwards before weakening in the last seventy yards. ALWAYS SUNSHINE caught directly behind the rival in distress, that
 being WESTWOOD, was checked as that one drifted to the outside in the vicinity of the half mile pole, recovered and resumed its pursuit three to four wide,
 got driven five wide, the widest of all, into the lane, had no rally. RECRUITING READY argued for the advantage along the inside, succumbed when
 challenged by BOBBY ABU DHABI approaching the end of the bend, stepped into the lane having little left and retreated. WESTWOOD forwardly placed
 three wide, lost its action after taking a bad step nearing the conclusion of the backstretch, was pulled up after being eased then was subsequently vanned
 off.

 FOURSTAR CROOK settled just off the inside in mid pack of the main flight well behind the leader and closest pursuer patiently handled through to the
 quarter pole, angled five wide at that station set down for the drive, rallied wilingly to take over command nearing the sixteenth pole, dug in and held on
 gamely from her late surging barnmate to prevail. SISTERCHARLIE (IRE) bumped at the start by EMPRESSOF THE NILE, settled just off the inside at the
 tail of the field, came under coaxing along the inside three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the
 final eighth surging late but missed on the wire. DADDYS LIL DARLING three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
 angled five wide into upper stretch, closed well down the center of the course to secure the show honors. MOM'S ON STRIKE three then two wide through
 the first turn, settled four wide near the rear, came under light coaxing with nine-sixteenths to go, remained in the overland route through the far turn, went
 eight to nine wide at the head of the stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the last major share. HOLY HELENA tracked the pace three wide from afar
 among the leaders of the main flight well behind, came under coaxing just off the inside midway on the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on
 through the stretch but was outkicked in the late going. FAHAN MURA lightly coaxed from the gate, spurted away in hand along the inside through swift
 splits, remained patiently handled awaiting the field to close in, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, held safe to the eighth pole before
 being overhauled near the sixteenth marker and weakened to the finish. EMPRESSOF THE NILE broke out at the start bumping SISTERCHARLIE, raced
 three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide in pursuit among the main flight leaders, got coaxed along three furlongs out, swung six wide at
 the quarter pole and offered no response. ESQUISSE (GB) tracked the pace along the inside isolated between the spurting leader and the main flight well
 behind, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up the mildest of bids gaining on the weary growing leader
 before flattening out through the final furlong. SNOWY WINTER tracked the pace just off the inside leading the main flight well behind the spurting leader
 and closest pursuer, came under coaxing tucked to the hedge three furlongs from home, swung two to three wide at the head of the stretch and came up
 empty.

 Footnotes
 CALL TO MIND (GB) was hustled along for the initial few jumps securing the pocket, rated kindly tracking the leader, slipped into path two the second time
 on the backstretch, was in hand working his way to the front on the final turn, got turned loose spinning into the lane, lost little if any of its lead during the
 ensuing furlong, held well in the final stages to prevail. CANESSAR (FR) saved ground in the early stages, moved into path two soon after leaving the
 second bend, continued to remain on hold all the way to the quarter pole, was under a drive heading home, altered course to be outside the winner in
 midlane, continued onward willingly nailing down the place. PRINCE OF ARRAN (GB) quickly placed along the inside route, gradually shifted into path three
 from the half mile pole to midpoint, got driven slightly wider into the lane, rallied for the show. ROCKETRY steadily moved up taking the inside route, in part
 because of various opponents abandoning it, got cued up angling three wide into the stretch, made no late headway. FUNNY KID rated in range two wide,
 swung four wide into the stretch, had no rally. NESSY reserved in path two, raced four wide on the last turn, had no response. COOPTADO (ARG) off the
 inside, stalked the leader two wide during the early going, went about the task one path wider off the rail after leaving the half mile pole, was backing away
 before arriving at the quarter pole and continued to do so once into the stretch. POSTULATION set the pace from the hedge, yielded readily when
 challenged by the top one past the half mile pole and faltered.

 Footnotes
 CAPTAIN HARDSHIP bumped at the start by MY DREAM who broke out a step at the start, settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under
 coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied closing well to get up in the final jumps and prevail. PROMPT forwardly placed
 three wide, was forced to steady and alter to the four path into the first turn as the rider came off WICKED TRICK in front, raced three wide through the
 opening bend before settling three to four wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and offered up a mild
 kick to issue a challenge through the final eighth to secure the place honors. MATHEMATICIAN tracked the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing
 three furlongs from home, swung three wide for home knocking heads, dug in under a drive taking command inside the eighth pole, dug in and was caught
 in the final jumps. MY DREAM broke out at the start bumping CAPTIAN HARDSHIP, settled just off the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing three
 furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. ROLLER ROLLS ON tracked the pace along the inside
 under coaxing from three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch, kept on through the drive but was outkicked. STEELES RUN steadied and altered
 out into the first turn as the rider came unseated off WICKED TRICK in front, assumed command and showed the way four then three wide through the first
 turn settling in the two path down the backstretch in hand, came under coaxing five-sixteenths out under challenge, spun just off the inside for home, dug in
 head to head and was displaced just inside the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. HAMPTON POINT just off the inside at the rear of the field, came
 under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. INTO THE BREACH four to five wide in the clear in mid
 pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. SHILOH LANE saved ground near the rear, came under coaxing three
 furlongs out, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. WICKED TRICK established the front shortly after the start and showed the
 way growing rank under the restraint of the rider tossing his head in defiance, knocked the rider off balance unseating him into the first turn. There was a
 Stewards' Inquiry into the incident into the clubhouse turn focusing on WICKED TRICK before the race was declared official.
