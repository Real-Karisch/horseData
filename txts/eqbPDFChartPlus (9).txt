 Footnotes
 GIGGITY vied along the inside from the outset, shook clear into mid-turn while racing near the inside, continued on a clear advantage into the lane then held
 under intermittent left-handed urging. SPY DANCER chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and gained
 the place spot late. SIGHTS AND SOUNDS vied for the lead with the winner two wide into the turn, lost contact with that one through the turn, continued to
 chase into the lane, could not cut into the advantage then lost the place spot late. DISCREET PROSPECT raced in the three to the two path through the
 turn and into the lane then lacked a closing bid. P T'S INTOMISCHIEF was in the two path through the turn and was never a serious threat. TACHI was
 bumped at the start, trailed into the turn while in the two path, came further off the rail entering the lane then was never a serious factor while offering a mild
 gain. PACIENCIA Y FE was in the five to the four path through the turn and continued to lose ground. EXPRESS CASH lunged to the outside at the start
 bumping rival, settled back in the rear and was never in it.

 Footnotes
 LOLA STEPHENS was in the three path into the far turn while unhurried, began asking for more in mid-turn, continued in the three path into the lane, moved
 three wide near the eighth pole then inched past the runner-up late. BETITALLWITHPAUL vied for the lead along the inside from the outset, was asked for
 more approaching the five-sixteenths pole, appeared to be laboring into the lane, repelled challenger just inside the eighth pole then continued on gamely to
 duel with the winner to the end. MARINA'S LEGACY vied for the lead two wide throughout, was still a serious contender after straightening in the lane then
 yielded to the top two nearing the sixteenth pole. CHICA CHERRY COLA chased the pace from near the inside through the far turn then lacked a closing
 response. PROPER REBELLION was in the two path through the turns while chasing the dueling leaders, came into the lane as a contender then faded.
 BELLA VELOCHE was outrun while racing near the inside through the turns.

 Footnotes
 DESERT IMAGE hustled out to vie for the early lead, cleared into the turn while moving to the inside, widened the lead into the lane as rider peeked back
 then was kept to the task to the end when not seriously threatened. SMART KIT chased the pacesetters from the four path through the turn, continued into
 mid-track for the drive and gained the place spot late while never a threat to the top one. LOVE MY LIFE vied for the early lead while racing in the two path,
 continued to chase the winner into deep stretch while not cutting into the advantage and relinquished the place spot late. MISCHIEVIOUS KAT chased the
 pace from the three path into the lane and finished evenly. EXPLODEN MOONSHINE was put in tight early and checked sharply, dropped back to last,
 shifted off the inside into the turn, continued in the three path into the lane then offered a mild bid. CANDY POP was along the inside through the turn and
 was never a threat. BUCH OF DAISIES was in the three to the two path through the turn and never factored. RANGERS FUNNY GIRL was bothered early
 when rival came in, raced near the inside into the turn and was done in mid-turn.

 Footnotes
 ARCHUSEXY vied for the lead along the inside, shook clear after straightening in the lane, widened to the eighth pole then was all out late while getting a bit
 weary. RUNAWAY ROSIE chased the dueling leaders from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, slowly inched up on the
 winner in mid-stretch then was surging at the end. FIVE MOONS vied for the lead two wide into the turn, yielded to the winner into the lane then could only
 save the show spot. QUICK GRADUATE was in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from mid-track and was gaining too late. PAIGE'S STAR
 bobbled at the start, was ridden hard early, settled off the dueling leaders into the turn, continued in the two path through mid-turn, dropped back in late turn
 then was never a menace thereafter. RED HOT RUMOR was never a factor while in the five to the three path through the turn. FANCY HAT TRICK raced
 along the inside through the turn and into the lane and was never in it. MISS CARTELLE raced along the inside through the turn when not far back then
 faded through the lane.

 CANDY SNATCHER was unrushed early, rallied four wide on the far turn, circled the field six wide at the quarter pole and wore down the leader, getting up
 late under steady urging. BRO pressed the pace in the four path outside of leaders, bid at the quarter pole to be clear but was caught at the wire. BLACK
 SALT stalked the pace in the five path, bid at the quarter pole but faltered. CONQUEST STORMY bid on the first turn inside, checked at the quarter pole,
 was steadied and under restraint for most of the next eighth of a mile, rallied inside of the winner, was steadied when lacking room at the quarter pole, then
 closed well. The stewards disallowed an objection by the rider of CONQUEST STORMY against the winner for interference at the eighth pole. SEYMOUR
 KID led inside before giving way in the drive. TWO STEPPING GROOM pressed the pace between foes to the stretch. NOT E Z BEINGGREEN stalked the
 pace in the four path, bid at the quarter pole and faltered in the stretch. ALLDAYLONG was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 KITTEN FOR GRANNY stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled inside of a rival through the stretch and prevailed under
 steady urging. TO THE KING was checked in the early going, raced inside, bid in the four path at the three-eighths pole, dueled outside of a foe through the
 stretch and was outfinished. GET YOUR SHMOCK ON was unrushed, then was along outside for the show. BOLD AGAIN stalked the pace inside but had
 no late bid. GIOVANTE stalked the pace between foes, bid at the three-eighths mark, then faltered. DISTANT MOON pressed the pace between rivals, then
 faded in the stretch. CAVE WOLF led in the two path to the far turn before giving way. HOLD THE FLAG HIGH was fractious in the gate, delaying the start,
 left awkwardly, trailed, stumbled near the half-mile mark and was distanced.
