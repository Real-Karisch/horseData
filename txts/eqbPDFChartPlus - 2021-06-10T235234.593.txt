 Footnotes
 ROCK N DOC set a pressured pace from the two path, kicked clear and moved over to the rail and drew off in the lane. JALISCO THREE broke out and
 bumped rival at the start, stalked from the inside, angled out in the upper-stretch and got up for second. ARTHUR'S HONOR settled off the pace, raced two
 wide, came with a mild rally in the stretch but was outfinished for the place. GETIN GREADY bumped leaving the gate, pressed from the inside, lost ground
 around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. DUTT BART off slow, traveled along the inside, lacked room behind horses on the turn, angled to the
 inside but failed to rally. ZACHIAN chased from the outside, took the turn three wide and weakened. MISTER FANCY BEAN tracked off the rail, raced three
 wide into the lane and faded. DREAMIN' OF BLAZE broke out, mid-pack in the early going, raced three wide then four wide on the turn, angled in leaving
 the bend and was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 MY LOUIE set the pace up the backstretch, inched away around the turn, urged heavily with the right-hand through the drive and held safely. SUNDAY
 PULPIT off the rail early, three wide around the turn, rallied in the lane but wasn't enough to threaten the winner. SCATASTIC chased outside a rival, two
 wide, moved over to the rail and finished evenly. T'S PLACE raced along the inside, shifted out around rival on the turn but failed to rally.
 WHATAHANDSOMECAT chased from the inside and weakened. ERCOLES dropped back after the start, raced off the rail, four wide around the turn and
 was never a factor.

 not rally. ELUSIVE MISTRESS raced along the inside, angled out on the turn and proved no menace.
