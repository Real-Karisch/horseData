 Footnotes
 PRINCESS PINKY displayed no ill effects after making light contact with ALPHADORA in the shadow of the starting gate, remained in path two, departed
 the backstretch lightly hand urged and with a good view of a wall consisting of four equines a short distance up ahead, got let out a notch at the
 five-sixteenths marker, angled outward until approximately six wide a furlong later, becoming the widest of all, kicked into her best in the general area of
 sixteenth pole, shot to the top in the final seventy yards and edged away. AMOS pulling a bit on the bit at the time, rushed up along the inside to take over
 shortly after the initial fraction had been finalized, went about the bend, hounded by a trio of opponents positioned in paths two through four respectively, got
 set down cutting the corner into the lane, emerged at the eighth pole clutching what turned out to be her largest advantage, got reeled in well inside the
 sixteenth maker, had no difficulty salvaging second. HAPPY SOPHIA away alertly, remained forwardly placed and well off the rail too, was in path four,
 vying as the widest of a quartet as the field ventured around the turn, shiifted slightly wider after getting called upon for the drive home, stayed in contention
 for the next furlong then tired. SINGULAR SENSATION involved in an abbreviated with ALPHADORA during the opening phases, saw the situation change
 dramatically once the second place fiinisher burst upon the scene midway on the backstretch, continued along in path three, but now as one of the middle
 members of line up of four from half mile pole to the top of the lane, completed the run through the furlong grounds before backing away. ALPHADORA
 came out slightly but enough so as to brush with the eventual winner, appeared keen pulling hard on the bit while contending with another for command for
 much of of the first two panels, saw the runner up grab away the advantage, went on to press the issue from path two and between rivals, doing so as one
 of group of four, made it to midstretch and tired. CHAMPAYNE three wide and under a light hand ride on the turn, failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 XANTHIQUE brushed at the start by the breaking inwards BALON ROSE, tracked from just off the inside just off the pace patiently handled until tipped out
 four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. BALON ROSE
 broke in at the start brushing the aforementioned foe, attended the pace under rating four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two
 path into the far turn, remained on hold through the bend assuming narrow command spinning just off the inside for home, got confronted straightened away
 and was roused in response getting headed nearing the eighth pole, then ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place honors. LA VIDA established
 the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the
 corner displaced from command into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong while along for the show honors. ESTILL tracked three then two wide
 remaining patiently handled until angled five wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, then improved position for the last major share. STAR OF THE
 EAST five paths off the inside down the backstretch forwardly placed, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, spun four wide for home and
 tired. PETALITE away well, settled four then three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
 into upper stretch and tired. ATHARY (IRE) two to three wide in pursuit, came under a ride three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.
 PASSION FLOWER coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside placed to light coaxing nine-sixteenths from home,
 cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

 THERE HE GOES gained command shortly after the field had been released, remained stationed along the inside route, showed the way, accompanied by
 a bevy of foes to the outside, began to extend the margin during the final stages of the run around the bend, being ridden with confidence and with the
 others having already been set to encouragement of varying degrees, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and was given his cue, left the eighh pole still
 comfortably in the clear, stayed on well in the final stages to fend off the second place finisher. CURLIN'S NEW MOON gradually made his way over to the
 rail on the backstretch, kept watch on the winner, picked up interest when put to a ride as three-quarters was being reeled off, gained late under a steady left
 side whip. PURCHASING POWER took up the chase marooned along the overland route, went on to secure the show. SOMEBODY stalked the winner
 from the two path, positioned in between rivals, and gettnig roused from the half mile pole onward, flattened out in the last eighth. CRAIGVILLE BEACH got
 pinched after losing his footing springing from the start, was about two wide both entering and exiting the turn, had no stretch response. HOARD strung out
 four wide while racing between opponents on the turn, had no response. CHANGE OF VENUE three wide in pursuit of the front runners, got asked by the
 five-sixteenths pole, went into the lane and folded.

 CARRERA CAT dueled from the three path with FORGOTTEN HERO to the outside, tucked inside nine-sixteenths from home, shook off her main pace rival

 MISS HOT STONES five paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the duel, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild kick. STARLITE MISSION coaxed from the gate, chased four to five wide down the
 backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was
 outkicked. SUNSHINE GAL bumped at the start by SARATOGA TREASURE who broke outwards, chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the
 turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner for home, offered up a mild bid being outkicked to the finish. SARATOGA TREASURE
 broke out at the start bumping SUNSHINE GAL, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got coaxed along midway on the bend, cut the

 DARK N CLOUDY off the inside throughout, settled into the path three after the start, vied as the widest of a threesome on the turn, struck the front end by
 the quarter pole but continued to be rated along until the three-sixteenths marker, stayed on well with good energy to preserve the decision. CREA'S BKLYN
 LAW tucked into the two path approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, was on hold wating behind foes from the head of the stretch until the general
 area of the three-sixteenths pole, tipped a couple of paths wider at the furlong grounds and into clearance, responded when given his cue, rallying with good
 energy to procure the place. TALE OF MIST perched in path four as a trio vied for command a short distance up ahead, commenced the stretch slightly
 wider, lacked a solid closing punch. MOHICAN took up the chase from the two path on the turn, angled one path farther off the rail into the stretch, made no
 headway. LEAP TO GLORY stationed along the inside route, was forced to fend off a pair of opponents to the outside, had already been displaced on top
 when set down coming up to the quarter pole, backed away steadily down the stretch. FLATEXCEL hustled along for the few first jumps out of the gate, got
 switched over to a good hold afterwards, pressed the issue in path two and in the middle of rivals during the run around the bend, was turned loose spinning
 into the stretch, folded.

 Footnotes
 HAMPTON POINT bumped at the start by DREAMMASTER who broke inwards, then got bumped solidly by that foe once more soon after the start nearly
 tossing the rider from the irons while forced to steady off the heels of a rival in front, settled tracking the pace just off the inside from mid pack, came under
 coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was just up in
 the final jumps to score. DUNCASTLE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through sensible splits, tucked inside into the
 turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in inching away to the eighth pole, grew leg weary inside the final
 sixteenth drifting out despite an off sided stick and was nailed on the last strides. AZZEDINE (FR) just off the pace four then three wide, came under coaxing
 at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, offered up a mild kick closing in through the final eighth, got briefly paused as the aforementioned foe
 drifted late while along for the show honors. SOCIAL CURRENCY (KOR) three then two wide in range of the front, came under coaxing along the inside
 three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on for the last major share. ELFITZ three wide in pursuit from near the rear,
 came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide at the quarter pole, improved position in the stretch. FIELD PATROL got away to a hesitant
 start getting away two beats slow, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, offered no response. WICKED
 TRICK three to four wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three
 wide into upper stretch and weakened. DREAMMASTER broke in at the start bumping HAMPTON POINT, then came in once more bumping that rival
 solidly while seeming to shy from WICKED TRICK to his outside, chased just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside into the far turn, came under
 coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact. MYTHAJACUL three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
 the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, tired.

 Footnotes
 DEVAMANI (FR) stayed along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, was firmly held forced to draft behind rivals beginning from the
 five-sixteenths pole, managed to knife itself into the three path and into freedom approximately a furong down the road, responded with good energy when
 given his cue and closed in readily, got up in the final seventy yards and edged away. NOBLE THOUGHT rode the rail until the quarter pole, was angled
 four wide into the stretch, finished willingly down the center of the course to garner the place. BIRD'S EYE VIEW attained a forward position prior to arriving
 at the end of the homestretch, was coaxed along prompting HOLIDAY BONUS from path two, issued a challenge spinning into the lane, forged to a slim
 advantage, held out facing stiff pressure for a sixteenth before releasing, weakened into the show slot. HOLIDAY BONUS established control in short order,
 cut over to the inside before departing the homestretch, proved ratable tailed by BIRD'S EYE VIEW to the outside, got put to the test by opponent as they
 stepped into the lane, relinquished by midstretch and backed away. THE GREEN MO'STER reserved in the two path, was moved to the outside leaving the
 five-sixteenths pole, wound up about five wide a furlong later, made no impact. SARRASIN (GB) strung out three wide on both turns, folded.

 Footnotes
 CARALICIOUS off the inside throughout, was three to four wide stalking the disputed pace, quickened springing from the five-sixteenths marker, got driven
 slightly wider into the stretch and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, began the final furlong as the new leader, kicked away. HONORABLE PROFIT
 lightly hand urged to establish the top, cut over to the inside route, showed the way feeling pressure from a pair of opponents to the outside for most of the
 opening half, was let out for the drive home, got collared by the winner at the furlong grounds, held on to save second. ROMPING ROSIE left the post
 parade early, proceeded to dwelt at the start, underwent a ground-saving journey, picked up interest at the furlong grounds, coming home with good energy
 enroute to garnering the show. FROSTY LINZ contended for the top mostly from path three and as the widest of a trio for about a half before giving way.
 TOPLINE moved into the two path after the start, vied from between rivals to the end of the bend, stepped into the stretch and backed away readily.
 SEMAYA sat within range of a three-way contested pace while two to three wide, completed the half and retreated.
