 Footnotes
 XTRACURRICULAR was bumped at the start, pressed the pace of WESTERN TRAJECTORY while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe
 nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lad into the lane and held sway to the wire. SOUTHAMPTON PRIDE was reserved just off the leaders early,
 raced four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished with good energy. WESTERN TRAJECTORY was away in good order
 to set a pressured pace from off the rail, gave way to the winner after going a half and continued on well in the drive. MOUNTAIN ON FIRE chased the
 leaders while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. JOHNNY JUNIOR lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a
 factor. LAST TRAIN OUT settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail though the turn and lacked the needed rally. GRAMS HALO was void of early speed,
 saved ground through the turn and did not menace. SMARTER THAN US was bumped at the break, raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide
 through the turn and gradually weakened. GRAPHIC was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and did not reach
 contention.

 Footnotes
 HOWBOUTTHEMCOWBOYS stalked the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew
 clear. PHILIPPIAN was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with GRAPHIC from off the rail, responded when challenged by the winner and
 gave way grudgingly to that foe in the drive. IATESOMUCHI'MPHIL lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and
 finished willingly. PHONE MY POSSE was forwardly placed early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached a
 contending position and finished evenly late. MORE FRONT was away in good order to dispute the pace with SMARTER THAN US while racing three-wide,
 gave way after going a half, checked into the lane and continued to retreat. KOVARRO showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled
 out further into the stretch and failed to menace. COUZINS GONE WILD was reserved off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and gradually
 weakened. HERE COMES GARY was forwardly placed early, moved five wide through the turn and weakened after going a half. ICELAKE lacked early
 foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CAPABLANCA lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

 final yards. W. GILES sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner
 late. WHATSTHEQUESTION was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders early, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. BIG
 LEGACY was bumped at the break then forwardly placed from the inside, remained inside for the drive and failed to gain late. LEONARDO DA VINCI

 Footnotes
 VANIDOSA was bumped at the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore
 with a sixteenth to run and drew off as a handy winner. LEAPT broke sharply to press the pace from between foes, moved up to take command nearing the
 five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin into the stretch, remained in control through mid-stretch but was no match for the winner late. BLUE HEN
 MADNESS was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. ALWAYS THIRSTY
 was off slow, rushed to contend, set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. HEARTY JONES was forwardly placed early, moved
 four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. GO PLACIDLY raced off the pacesetters from the inside and gradually weakened. MY FAVORITE
 CITY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BESS' GIRL lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and was.
 FOXY JOXY pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. NOVA NATION steadied soon after the start, dropped far
 back, was eased through the lane and vanned off.

 Footnotes
 FLATTERING RUBY dueled for the early advantage with ATINA SALSA from the inside, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear lead into the
 stretch and drew off with complete authority. IAIN'TNOSIZETWO was reserved just off the leaders early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out
 further into the lane, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished willingly. ATINA SALSA was away in good order to dispute the pace with the
 winner for a half and gave way. PRIMED TO FIRE settled off the leaders early, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. PARTY ROCK
 chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. OUR FIRST CANDY showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did
 not menace. ANOTHER GIRL lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EMPRESS LIVIA showed brief speed and weakened.
 BUNKER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. MISS PINK raced off the pacesetters early,
 moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

 Footnotes
 CUCKOO FORCONONUTS was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, moved five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and caught
 ELLA'S SONG in the closing yards. ELLA'S SONG was bumped at the start, opened a long lead before going a quarter, remained in control through
 mid-stretch and appeared to tire late. VALIANT SPIRIT was never far back, raced three-wide through the turn, checked nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
 angled out and finished with good courage. HERE'S WATTEVER lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and
 finished with some late run. HURRICANE PATRICIA stumbled at the start, recovered quickly to chase the pace of ELLA'S SONG while racing four-wide and
 weakened in the drive. WONDERFUL SAVVY settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. LEOTA EVEN BID lacked early foot, raced
 five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. YOUARESTILLTHEWON raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.
 RACHEYBULLBAH was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MISS STEFFI lagged throughout.
