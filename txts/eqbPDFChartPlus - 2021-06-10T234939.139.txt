 Footnotes
 BENCHMARK BABE was taken to rate just off of a contested pace while three wide, eased out a bit wider and moved to command in hand past the three
 eighths, was guided further out entering the lane, drifted in while widening on her own in mid stretch and proved much the best in handy fashion. VAUGHN
 settled in the two path, angled out leaving the three furlong marker, advanced between rivals and was clearly second best. POSTINO'S SECRET was sent
 from the gate, dueled to the inside of COMMUNION MONEY, battled under a ride past the half, failed to quicken with the winner nearing the lane and faded.
 NAIRET , four to six wide prompting the pace, gave way in the final furlong. COMMUNION MONEY dueled outside POSTINO'S SECRET, came four wide
 for the drive and tired. NOTTHATITMATTERS saved ground and weakened.

 Footnotes
 KITTY'S RIGHT was angled out in the opening furlong, rallied five wide outside rivals approaching the quarter pole, moved to a slim lead nearing the eighth
 pole then edged clear late under strong handling. SAZERAC GIRL rated early, quickly gained four wide and challenged FERGIE'S LADY entering the
 stretch, dueled between rivals leaving the furlong grounds, gave way grudgingly and just held the place. SARAH'S TREASURE , off the early pace, was
 under a ride three wide past the three eighths, swung six wide for the drive and rallied. FERGIE'S LADY cleared early, set the pace inside, was joined after
 a half mile, battled inside rivals leaving the eighth pole and kept trying to the wire. SHE'S ACHANCE TOO prompted the pace three wide, bid between foes
 nearing the stretch, dueled past the eighth pole then faded late. SIPPY CUP chased the pace while off the rail, lacked a late response then collapsed about
 seventy yards after the wire. BALTIMORE STREET stalked the pace two wide, was ridden along past the five sixteenths, failed to quicken after a half mile
 and gave way.

 Footnotes
 LOCAL THRILLER stalked the early pace, advanced four deep leaving the turn, swept to command at the head of the stretch, pulled away and was under
 urging in mid stretch. FIREY CHILD , a forward factor two wide on the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and lacked the needed late response.
 SHARON'S THUNDER saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path approaching the stretch, was taken to the four path near the eighth pole and
 flattened out. SOMETHINGWITHLILLY , well positioned in the three path on the turn, weakened through the stretch. MAGNATO GO set the pace in the
 three path around the turn, gave way and raced on her left lead much of the stretch. MO MONEY MONICA was no factor. MAIS OUI D'OR hugged the inner
 rail, prompted the pace and gave way. MERRY GO REGAL trailed.

 between foes then angled six wide for the drive, closed under strong handling, forged to command a furlong out then held firm to turn away MR.
 BRIGHTSIDE. MR. BRIGHTSIDE settled to the inside of the winner, edged up leaving the far turn, steadied with run near the five sixteenths, shifted out and
 circled eight wide into the lane, straightened away and closed willingly to gain. CAN'TMAKETHISUP dueled three wide between rivals, shook clear inside
 the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. HORSESHOE HARBOUR , four to five wide off the dueling leaders, steadily advanced leaving the far turn,
 had aim under pressure in upper stretch then flattened out in the final sixteenth. MISCHIEVOUS DAN settled off the pace while about four wide, gained
 some leaving the five sixteenths, came six wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. SOME PROMISES tracked the dueling leaders while off the rail, was
 under pressure past the five sixteenths, steadied briefly when lacking room near mid stretch then went evenly once clear. STILBURNIN , five wide nearing
 the seven eighths, dueled four wide outside rivals, held a short lead nearing the lane then weakened in mid stretch. MAN OF WIREGRASS had speed from
 the gate then was rated back off the leaders leaving the seven eighths, re-bid inside rivals after a half mile, sparred to the three sixteenths then faded.
 SQUASHVILLE ROAD stalked the pace while inside rivals, came under pressure after a half mile, failed to go on leaving the far turn and weakened.
 AUGIE'S COMING was sent up between rivals to gain a slim early lead, dueled in the two path inside rivals nearing the five eighths, was between runners
 near the far turn and tired.

 LAST TRUE LOVE chased the pace three wide around the turn, secured command in upper stretch, responded to urging and eagerly drew away. PIKACHU
 PRINCESS , lightly steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn, worked between horses in the lane, was carried out a bit
 by THOUGHTLESS DOLL near the sixteenth pole and rallied gamely. THOUGHTLESS DOLL accelerated to the early lead after breaking last, set the pace
 in the two path on the turn, failed to keep pace with the winner in upper stretch, weakened, swerved out near the sixteenth pole and fell about a sixteenth of
 a mile past the wire. CHAUNCEY , four deep around the turn, was well positioned for the drive and failed to rally. WHYYOUASK hugged the inner rail,
 chased the pace and weakened. PROPORTIONALITY chased the pace two wide on the turn, dropped back entering the stretch and swung to the five path
 in mid stretch.

 Footnotes
 GLENNRICHMENT stalked the pace three wide, came under a strong ride mid way on the final turn as the leader edged away a bit, kept on grinding after
 being shifted out wider entering lane, reeled in GRECIAN PRINCE near the sixteenth pole and edged clear at the wire. GRECIAN PRINCE cleared early,
 set the pace off the inside while under a light hold, moved away some leaving the five sixteenths, was guided to the three path and put to a drive soon into
 the lane, remained clear past the furlong grounds but could not contain the winner in the final sixteenth. KING KOA broke a step slow, settled off the rail,
 came under a ride leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the stretch, moved up near the eighth pole but failed to follow through. YOUNG AMERICAN
 stumbled at the break, regrouped and settled towards the inside, eased out and moved up between foes nearing the stretch, altered in continuing progress
 in mid stretch then flattened out late. AWESOME BILL, four wide stalking the pace, was under pressure past the three eighths, stayed in range to the
 quarter pole then gave way. STONE , two to three wide stalking the pace, was under a ride leaving the far turn, failed to go on past the quarter pole and
 faded. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH , in tight at the break, moved up towards the rail leaving the five eighths, lacked a response leaving the far turn and retreated.

 Footnotes
 CHILD'S PLAY , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace while outside foes down the backstretch, advanced four deep on the far turn, swept to command
 entering the stretch and pulled away under some mild coaxing. LULU'S ON THE MOVE lacked speed, swung to the five path leaving the far turn and
 passed tired horses. NORTHERNSTREETGAL stalked the pace, gained a three wide lead mid way on the far turn then weakened through the stretch.
 JANELLE DREAMS saved ground on the turns, eased out to the two path turning for home and was not a factor. CARDILLIA , two wide entering the far
 turn, angled to the four path leaving the bend and gave way. NAILED IT , four wide the first turn, kept well wide throughout, raced four wide into the far turn
 and six wide entering the stretch. CAPSTONE LADY chased the pace two wide and faltered after six furlongs. RIGHTUPYOURALLEY set the pace along
 the inner rail and faltered turning for home.
