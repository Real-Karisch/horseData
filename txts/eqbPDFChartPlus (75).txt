 Footnotes
 WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY was away in good order and raced in tracking mode off the top pair of embattled leaders, continued three wide in close contention
 near the quarter pole then given cue to head in pursuit leaving the turn, raced five wide in upper stretch and continued to steadily gain on the top two
 leaders, assumed command in final sixteenth under left handed pressure and finished clear. HEIRESSALL was off to a good start and applied pace
 pressure to LIZA STAR, continued to force the issue through the backstretch then edged up and raced on equal terms around the turn, continued to battle in
 stretch run, got by LIZA STAR but could not kick on with the winner. LIZA STAR held a slim lead and set a pressured pace down the backstretch, raced
 along the inside and dueled for the lead with HEIRESSALL around the turn, continued to battle back gamely in stretch run then had no kick left in deep
 stretch. STORMY EMBRACE raced in tracking mode under slight restraint through early stages, moved through the turn four wide, came out wide for the
 drive, stayed under steady pressure but lacked the needed response for impact. MOTION'S FIRST was ridden along to maintain position through the
 backstretch, saved ground into stretch run and offered no late bid. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT raced two to three wide never far off the early pace, prompted but
 failed to advance position around the turn then had no response in the lane.

 CECI VALENTINA angled to the inside to save ground in opening stages, was ridden along but lacked early foot, angled out and showed quick response
 around the turn, continued a strong bid along the outside turning for home then forced out wider, set down driving under right handed encouragement,
 finished sharply and kicked clear. MANDAMUS was forwardly placed in opening stages, prompted and advanced to duel for the lead with MS BIG SPRING
 around the turn, shook free and led the way at the quarter pole, kept under steady pressure with good response then got collared in final sixteenth. GO
 GATOR GIRL GO raced off the early pace along the outside then dropped over to the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, roused up
 the inside in stretch run and cleared share. MS BIG SPRING led the way by a length on top in early stages, dueled for the lead around the turn, could not
 match strides at quarter pole then drifted out wider turning for home and faded. LET'S BE HONEST raced off the early speed, hustled up three to four wide
 and failed to move into contention. MOCHACCINO was forwardly placed down the backstretch, failed to hold position under pressure around the turn then
 retreated in the lane. DELTA HUTCH steadied along the inside in early stages, chased around then turn then had no response in the lane. BIG AFFAIR
