 Footnotes
 FLOWERS VALE broke out and bumped Southern Marsh at the start, angled in to set the pace inside, rounded the turn off the rail, then drove down the
 lane, mostly under an aggressive hand ride, and widened her lead in the final sixteenth. RUMERS ARE TRUE gave chase from the inside, racing on the rail
 throughout, then dug in gamely down the stretch and came up second in the final sixteenth. SOUTHERN MARSH was bumped at the start by Flowers Vale,
 chased the pace on the outside and took the turn in the three path, then leveled off in later yards. HEAVENLY BODY gave chase on the outside and
 rounded the turn in the four path, then entered the head of the lane in the nine path and finished evenly. GANS' PIPEDREAM raced at the back and was
 never a threat.

 Footnotes
 BROCKTON GEORGE stalked the early pace from the two and three paths then saved ground into the second turn, rallied to the front three wide nearing
 the five sixteenths pole and raced clear at the pole, widened through the far turn and was steadily encouraged down the lane. ZARSKI raced off the early
 pace in the three and four paths, started a bid leaving the half mile pole, steadily improved to come between horses three wide approaching the head of the
 lane, was carried wider leaving the turn then dueled the length of the stretch for second. DADDY'S TELLER saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the
 seven sixteenths pole, angled out nearing the head of the lane but was outfinished in a long stretch duel for second. TAYLOR'S CORK raced well off the
 pace and off the rail and showed little early response, raced outside into the backstretch, saved some ground on the far turn then passed tiring rivals in an
 even finish. Racing without front shoes, STARRY MESSENGER rated the pace inside, was headed approaching the five sixteenths pole, gave chase from
 that point, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride through the lane. CHARITABLE MARK stumbled at the break then rated off the early pace in
 the three path and showed little response after three quarters of a mile. SET'EM UP JOE stalked the pace from the three and four paths, challenged leaving
 the seven sixteenths pole then faded past the five sixteenths.

 Footnotes
 ROYAL BLUE settled off the pace and off the rail, was urged a bit leaving the half mile pole, started a drive from the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two
 deep approaching the five sixteenths, contested the edge at the rail to the mid point of the far turn, raced clear from that point and held well under steady
 encouragement. PUGET SOUND raced off the pace in the three and four paths, was prompted into the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage two
 deep to the mid point of the far turn, dropped back at the three sixteenths pole and had to settle for second best. EMBLEM'S ESTATE raced well back
 saving ground, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and finished evenly. REVIVE AND RESURGE settled well
 back saving ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved his position in the three path of the far turn, drifted into the lane and passed a rival.
 GET BUSTED drew off to a long early lead then gave way when overcome nearing the five sixteenths pole. MIGHTY BITE saved ground off the pace and
 was through after three quarters of a mile. UNSPOKEN QUALITY was not a factor and BORN IN BROOKLYN was through early.

 even terms mid-stretch, and took over just past that point, finishing well. HAPPY SOPHIA stalked the pace two wide between horses, bid near the
 five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the three path, then gained down the lane on the outside to come up second in the final strides. SWEET MILK

 Footnotes
 ONE DAY MORE came away sharply then pulled clear and moved to the inside to set the pace, was hand urged away from the quarter pole then only
 moderately asked through the lane. HOT HEADED GAL chased the winner from the three path, dug in through the lane and held on for second.
 WOLFBLADE chased the pace from the three and four paths, lugged in under a hard right rein and left handed drive but still made contact with Ginger In
 Disguise in the upper stretch, corrected course but lugged toward the rail again in later yards then just missed second. GINGER IN DISGUISE chased the
 pace inside, rounded the turn at the rail, was bumped in the upper stretch then flattened stride later yards. BROWNIE BREAK bobbled from the gate, picked
 up the chase toward mid track, rounded the turn about the four path but proved empty down the lane. AUSSIE GOLD angled to the outside to give chase
 and rounded the turn in the six and seven paths. GIN N SPICE broke in the air and bolted to the outside on the chute, gave chase widest through the
 backstretch then saved ground on the turn. The stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Wolfblade, lodged by the rider of Ginger In Disguise,
 and disqualified the former for making contact with the latter in the upper stretch. Due to an equipment malfunction, this race was hand timed.

 Footnotes
 MOONLIT SONG angled in quickly and stalked the pace inside, raced well in hand and eased out to the three path to take over without encouragement at
 the three-sixteenths pole, then drew off and drove down the lane under steady handling, and held on well. ALL FLATTER angled to the rail through the front
 stretch and settled off the pace inside, bid near the five-sixteenths and eased out through the turn to the five path, then raced down the stretch on the
 outside and finished evenly. SPANISH MOSS, saving ground into the first turn, settled well off the pace on the inside at a distant fourth, bid near the
 three-eighths pole, rounded both turns on the rail, then gained down the lane and finished well. JACKY'S NOTION settled well off the pace on the outside,
 bid near the quarter pole off the rail, then finished evenly. B'S WILD CORK settled well back on the outside and showed little until passing tired rivals in the
 stretch. ROCK N' GOLD was never a factor. SISTER AIM hustled up to rate the pace outside early and angled to the rail leaving the first turn, took the far
 turn on the rail, but was caught at the three-sixteenths pole and faded. PER RULING #17 FROM THE WEST VIRGINIA RACING COMMISSION, SISTER
 AIM WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 7th TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
