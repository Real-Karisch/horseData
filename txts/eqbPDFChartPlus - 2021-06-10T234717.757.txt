 Footnotes
 PROCIDANA hustled up and angled in through the first turn to rate the pace inside, rounded all turns on the rail and maintained a comfortable lead, drew off
 through the far turn and was urged near the three-sixteenths pole, then drove down the lane mostly under a hand ride and held on. DORIDORI rated off the
 pace inside, bid near the five-sixteenths pole and eased to the outside soon after, rounded the turn in the four path, then rallied in the stretch, closing on the
 winner, and finished well. STARBOARD chased the pace from the outside, angled in past the five-sixteenths pole and bid at the quarter pole on the rail,
 then finished evenly. CHARITABLE LASS chased the pace on the inside, bid past the five-sixteenths pole, rounded all turns on the rail, then finished evenly.
 SOARING ELLA rated well back and was never a factor. MY COUSIN VICKY rated off the pace on the outside, then made a mild bid past the
 five-sixteenths pole and was through.

 Footnotes
 FRAGRENT CANDLE tapered in to set the pace toward the inside, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the turn, raced clear into the stretch and
 held well under steady encouragement. HERCATWILLFOOLU angled to the outside early on to give chase, took aim three wide approaching the five
 sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep rounding the turn but dropped back into the stretch and had to settle for second best. SHE'S
 HAD ENOUGH angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the five and six paths, entered the stretch widest and was just up for third in an even
 finish. ELUSIVE CAMILLA gave chase from the inside, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened stride through the lane. BET U CANT FIND ME chased the
 earlier pace in the four path, rounded the turn just off the rail and showed little further. DANCIN IN THE SOUP gave chase from the three and four paths
 through most of the backstretch, rounded the turn in the five path then weakened. MAJESTIC LYRIC was not a factor.

 ROCK ON pressured the pace from the two and three paths, contested at a close disadvantage two deep rounding the turn but dug in under determined
 handling to take the edge late yards. IMA CAT GENIUS took over just out of the chute to set a pressured pace inside, contested the edge nearest the rail
 rounding the turn and dug in gamely to late stretch before yielding; reluctantly. CASTLE FIVE pressured the early pace in the three and four paths, remained
 in range in the five path of the turn and raced evenly through the lane. PAGAN SMART chased the early pace from the three path then steadied in the
 vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn two deep, angled to the outside mid-stretch and finished evenly. WINDSOR LEGEND gave chase from
 the inside and finished evenly. INDUS VALLEY MAN chased the pace toward the outside, raced in the five path through the turn but had little left in the
 stretch.

 Footnotes
 CASTLES TRICK settled well back on the outside, bid leaving the three-eighths pole and steadily improved through the turn in the six path, entered the
 head of the lane on the outside and drove down the stretch, quickly gaining and passing rivals, to come up first in the final strides. GOLDEN METTLE was
 bumped at the start by Gotto Getitman, rushed up and angled in to rate the pace inside, rounded both turns on the rail, was urged near the quarter pole,
 then dug in gamely in the lane but was caught in the final strides. SWISS SUNRISE chased the pace two wide between horses and bid past the
 five-sixteenths pole, took the turn in the three path, then raced down the lane under an aggressive hand ride and finished evenly. FEISTY AND SASSY
 chased the pace toward the inside in about the three path, bid near the five-sixteenths pole and angled in to round the turn on the rail, then finished evenly.
 FLASHY READY RICK settled to the outside and bid past the three-eighths pole, took the turn in the five path, but leveled off in the stretch. WHAT A
 STORY chased the pace on the outside, bid at the seven-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the three path, but flattened out late in the lane. BLIMEY
 LIMEY settled to the inside and bid approaching the quarter pole in the four path, then leveled off toward the wire. CHASE MY ACE was bumped at the start
 by Gotto Getitman, saved ground into the first turn and settled off the pace on the inside, but showed little. GOTTO GETITMAN broke out and bumped
 Golden Mettle then into Chase My Ace, raced at the back and was never a threat, then was eased in the lane.

 Footnotes
 Inside early, SILVER TAURUS eased three wide into the first turn and stalked the pace entering the backstretch, challenged toward the five sixteenths, took
 the lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled clear midway on the far turn, was steadily handled to widen through the upper stretch then hand ridden the final
 sixteenth. APPEALING GROOM saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, progressed in the four path of the far turn and took
 second just inside the sixteenth pole while no match for the winner. WHY ALL DA TIME rounded the opening turn in the five path and settled outside into the
 backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, improved his position in the three path of the far turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth.
 CANDY MAN ONE raced off the pace in the three path the first turn then eased out past the half mile pole, bid toward the seven sixteenths, dropped back in
 the three path rounding the far turn and had little left in the stretch. COKER STROKER angled in through the front stretch and took over two deep into the
 opening turn to rate the pace, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the advantage approaching the quarter then faded from the head of the
 lane. MEISTER'S SONG had the lead inside through the front stretch then faded steadily. PICKLES N LIME was not a factor.

 BIG SLICK angled in to rate the pace inside, rounded both turns on the rail, was urged near the eighth pole, then drove down the lane, being tapped once in
 the upper stretch, and finished with an aggressive hand ride to hold on. JEFFERY SCOTT was bumped at the start by Cat Mor Bridge, saved ground into
 the first turn and settled to the inside, eased to the outside leaving the first turn, bid past the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turn in the six path, then
 raced down the lane and was slowly closing on the winner. FINBAR, saving ground into the first turn, settled off the pace inside, bid at the three-eighths pole
 and took the turn in the three path, then gained down the stretch and finished evenly. SIENTE EL VIENTO settled well off the pace inside, bid past the
 five-sixteenths pole and rounded both turns on the rail, then eased out leaving the turn and gained down the lane, angling to the rail mid-stretch, and
 finished well. BUNGALOW settled to the outside and bid near the quarter pole in the four path, then leveled off down the stretch. CAT MOR BRIDGE broke
 in and bumped Jeffery Scott at the start, was steadied early in the front stretch and settled well back on the outside, took the turn in the four path, then
 passed tired rivals in the lane. RELENTLESS STRIKE broke out and bumped Kingdom Minded at the start, saved ground through the first turn and settled to
 the inside, bid near the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the turns on the rail, but weakened in the lane. KINGDOM MINDED was bumped at the start by
 Relentless Strike and stalked the pace on the outside, but was through after a half. CHARITABLE HERO was never a factor.

 POZZUOLI rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. AMOS P raced with the
 pace three wide through the front stretch and moved to even terms into the backstretch, had a slim lead past the half mile pole but was headed toward the
 five sixteenths and started to fade into the far turn. GENERAL MOSBY came away slowly then attempted to bolt into the first turn, was pulled up at that point
 but loped around the track to the middle of the far turn before being aided by the outrider and walked off.
