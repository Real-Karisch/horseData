 CONQUEST PRANKSTER broke in the air, opened a clear lead soon after, stayed close to the rail around the turn, ran out a bit entering the stretch and
 held stubbornly. BLUEGRASS POSSE wasn't far back, gave his best inside the winner in midstretch but couldn't gain to the end. DISCREET DAN wasn't far
 back in the three path but lacked a rally. DOUBLE SKY chased early, moved outside the winner on the turn then flattened out. AL DO GREAT trailed after a
 slow break.

 rallied to the fore just before a mile then quickly drew clear. PENITENCE settled between rivals, angled to the rail nearing the stretch, steadied approaching
 the final furlong, vied inside the early leader in midstretch but couldn't stay with the winner. L. A. HOUSE showed speed, moved clear from the outside
 entering the far turn, lugged in under right hand whip nearing the final furlong, held on past midstretch then gave way. SHOOBIEDOOBYDOO wasn't far
 back outside early, moved closer two wide on the final turn then flattened out. KICK IT DEEP fell back inside on the backstretch and continued evenly to the

 LIL MAJESTY was taken in hand early, came out, bumped AMERICAN PRAISE midway on the backstretch, moved outside the early leader into the far turn,
 took over in early stretch, bore out sharply under left hand whip in midstretch, bumped PAYNEFUL then held off that one. Following an inquiry and objection
 by Gonzalez, LIL MAJESTY was disqualified and placed second. PAYNEFUL was slow inside, began a run into the far turn, came out two wide nearing the
 stretch, was carried out and bumped while vying outside in midstretch but wasn't enough. INTHEMOODTODANCE was caught in tight along the rail on the
 first turn, was bumped while trying to rally into the far turn, remained inside and finished willingly. INDIGESTION cleared early, angled to the inside,
 remained in command into the stretch then weakened. THE RAGIN SEMINOLE had early position outside, was bumped midway on the backstretch and
 faded after three quarters. RING THE BELLA raced outside early, came in on INTHEMOODTODANCE entering the far turn then tired. AMERICAN PRAISE
 wasn't far back between horses when bumped into THE RAGIN SEMINOLE midway on the backstretch, remained close into the far turn then stopped. KISS
 THE SPIDER was outrun. BEHIND THE BLING trailed.
