 Footnotes
 ALL BLINGED OUT prompted the pace to the inside of DON'T BE SCARED, allowed that one to go on leaving the half then angled out, came back under
 some coaxing approaching the quarter pole, wrested command under right hand rousing in mid stretch, switched to his left lead while going clear past the
 sixteenth pole then held firm. HIBERNIA FIRE was taken to rate off the leaders and raced in the two path, dropped in to advance in upper stretch, churned
 on inside rivals past the sixteenth marker and gained the place. DON'T BE SCARED broke outward then quickly correct and went up outside to take
 command, rated three wide outside the winner, moved clear leaving the far turn, was collared entering the lane, dueled past the furlong grounds and
 weakened late. INVISIBLE CROWN chased the leaders two to three wide, moved up behind foes in mid stretch then flattened out. RESIDENT SCHOLAR
 was steadied in close quarters saving ground around the first turn, settled off the pace, angled out under pressure in mid stretch and had belated action.
 REID THE NEWS was rated back from between foes leaving the gate and never threatened. PER RULING FROM THE MARYLAND RACING
 COMMISSION, ALL BLINGED OUT WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

 SO QUIET rated three to four wide off the dueling leaders, advanced in hand leaving the five sixteenths, responded when shaken up a sixteenth later,
 moved clear under a drive in upper stretch, swerved inward near the sixteenth pole, was corrected with one crack of the left stick and was much the best
 while hand ridden late. CITY GOLD angled in early and settled, shifted out gathering some momentum near the far turn, advanced five wide under a drive
 near the quarter pole, loomed briefly but failed to match strides in the final three sixteenths. PAPA PABLO , a bit rank soon after the start, regrouped and
 settled well back, angled out near the far turn, gained five wide past the five sixteenths, was no match for the top pair but continued willingly. DETERMINED
 dueled two wide and to the inside of SUPERMENSCH, shook clear after six furlongs, was confronted near the quarter pole, stayed willingly to about mid
 stretch then gave way. SUPERMENSCH vied three wide outside the leader, was under pressure from the three eighths to the quarter pole and tired.

 Footnotes
 SAMMY BE COOL sped to the early lead, set the pace near the rail and was under brisk urging in the drive. ROMIA raced outside the winner and gamely
 chased that one around the track. SIMONELA , along the inner rail most of the trip, closed gamely. FRICTION FIRE , five deep leaving the turn, was no
 threat. SOUTHAMPTON WAY , two wide on the turn, chased the pace and gave way. SUN DRESS ran off with her rider almost a quarter of a mile during
 the post parade, tried to get out on the turn and was outrun. LOCAL THRILLER , steadied in some traffic soon after the break, was not a factor. SING DIXIE
 CHARGE , no factor, lacked room the final sixteenth of a mile.

 Footnotes
 WHILE YE MAY was gunned from the gate and established command, kicked away from JARVIS STEEL while ridden along past the three eighths,
 remained well in front under left handed rousing past the furlong grounds and held sway. LIGHT THE NIGHT stalked the pace four wide, circled five wide
 while put to pressure into the lane and rallied to earn the place. JARVIS STEEL prompted the pace outside the winner entering the turn, rated back a bit
 soon after and saw the winner open up, came under pressure into the lane and kept trying between rivals. EASY RIVER , off the pace and removed from
 the rail, shifted out leaving eighth pole and closed steadily. INDIAN BUCKS saved ground under urging, gave willing pursuit to the sixteenth pole then faded.

 ZINGER stalked the duel, edged up under some coaxing past the half mile pole then angled out, bid four wide under pressure after six furlongs, took
 command entering the lane, shook clear of rivals under strong left hand rousing in mid stretch then steadily widened while kept to task. AMERICAN ROAD
 leaned in at the break and brushed with LAPOCHKA, corrected and was sent up to engage PIZMO TIME from his outside, dueled through honest fractions,
 gained a slim lead under urging near the five sixteenths, ceded command past the quarter pole but kept on willingly to save the place between foes.
 LAPOCHKA , brushed at the break, settled off the dueling leaders, gained five wide leaving the three eighths pole, loomed boldly into the lane, had his rider
 lose the whip nearing the sixteenth marker and hung. PIZMO TIME dueled inside on a short lead, remained a solid presence to the furlong pole then gave
 way grudgingly.

 Footnotes
 BUZZ LITE , four deep around the turn, closed outside horses, bid for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and got the bob. WILKO'S GOLDENEYE , a bit
 fractious in the post parade, raced in the two path on the turn, in three path in the stretch, challenged for the lead between horses inside the sixteenth pole
 and just missed in a game effort. SLIM disputed the pace outside ABOLITIONIST and faded late. KID CAN DO saved ground on the turn and was no factor.
 FULL OF BEANS raced in the three path on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. ABOLITIONIST hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and faltered
 in mid stretch. ACCOUNTABLE trailed.
