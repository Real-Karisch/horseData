 BINGLEY chased off the rail, angled in entering the stretch, rallied along the inside but could not get by. NEVADA WILD CAT chased outside a rival, three
 wide into the stretch, showed a mild response and gained ground in the final sixteenth. SOFT TRIP outside a rival early on, two wide around the turn and
 never rallied. AUTISMONEFORTYFIVE traveled along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and also lacked a rally. HEAT THINGS UP chased from the
