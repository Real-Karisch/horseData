 Footnotes
 BASKET BABY broke a step slow and out then settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid near the quarter pole and took over at that pole in the three
 path, then angled to the rail mid-stretch and held on. KENZIE stalked the pace on the outside and took over approaching the three-eighths pole without
 encouragement two wide between horses, angled to the rail near the quarter pole and was caught at that pole, rounded the turn on the rail, then dug in
 gamely down the lane but was unable to close. CORY'S CUTIE settled off the pace on the outside and bid near the three-eighths pole, improved through
 the turn in the five path, then finished evenly on the outside. COWGIRL CHICK, saving ground into the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside, rounded
 the first turn on the rail, then angled out and bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole, took the far turn in the three path, then finished evenly. WORK WIFE
 squeezed through an opening at the rail to take the lead at the first turn, was caught near the three-eighths pole, then dropped back and was steadied at the
 heels of Kenzie near the quarter pole and never regained momentum.

 sixteenths pole, contested even terms nearest the rail rounding the far turn, pulled clear in the upper stretch and dug in under all out handling to turn back
 the challenge of Catcher. CATCHER angled in to stalk the pace from the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, drew to even terms three wide
 leaving the five sixteenths, contested even terms two deep rounding the far turn, dropped back past the eighth pole but stayed on to the end. CHATTER
 PATTERN took over shortly after the start and moved to the inside to set the pace while firmly reined in, was pressured nearing the five sixteenths pole,
 headed toward the quarter, faded at the rail rounding the far turn, though, finished evenly. BRUTE FORCE raced off the pace in the four path the opening
 turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, drifted to the eight path rounding the far turn and finished evenly. PRINCETONIAN raced off the early pace in
 the two and three paths then settled outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, was carried out nearing the top of the lane and entered
 the stretch in the nine path then finished evenly. PAUL AND SILAS saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the
 rail rounding the far turn. SLICKY BOY raced well off the pace and was not a factor. GLEN'S CASTLE saved early ground while well off the pace and never
 factored.

 Footnotes
 SON OF FLICKER was bumped at the start by First Talent and then by Mystic Park, then angled to the rail through the front stretch to pressure the pace
 from the inside, dropped back past the seven-sixteenths pole and bid at the five-sixteenths, rounded the turn in the three path, then drove down the lane
 under steady handling to come up first in later yards. SUPER CAUSEWAY broke in and bumped First Talent at the start then chased the pace toward the
 outside, took over past the three-eighths pole without encouragement, started the far turn in the four path and drew clear near the quarter pole, then saved
 ground through the turn and dug in gamely down the lane but was outfinished. MONEYWISE settled off the pace inside, rounded both turns on the rail,
 made a bid at the three-eighths pole and eased out leaving the turn, then leveled off toward the wire. MYSTIC PARK broke out and bumped into Son of
 Flicker at the start then settled off the pace toward the outside, bid near the quarter pole on the rail, then gained down the stretch nearest the rail and
 finished evenly. ALWAYS WILBUR lunged out and hit the gate, then settled well back on the inside but eased out through the first turn, bid leaving the
 three-eighths pole and angled in past the five-sixteenths pole to round the turn on the rail, then moved to the outside leaving the turn and finished widest.
 PLEASANTLY ROYAL hustled up to rate a pressured pace on the outside, was caught past the three-eighths pole, angled in and dropped back through the
 turn on the rail, then faded in the stretch. RUN FORREST (IRE) was never a factor. FIRST TALENT was bumped at the start by Super Causeway and into
 Son of Flicker, then settled off the pace on the outside, showed little, and was through after a half.

 Footnotes
 GOODBYESEEULATER rated off the pace in the three path the first turn and settled close into the backstretch, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole,
 took the lead two deep past the quarter, raced clear nearing the top of the lane then steadily handled to hold on well. HARDENED WILDCAT raced well off
 the pace and off the rail the first turn then angled out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, circled rivals in the eight path of the
 far turn and finished well to take second in the final yards. LETCHER came away a step slow and settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the
 three eighths pole, closed to striking range in the three path of the far turn, occupied second through most of the lane but ceded that position in the final
 yards. WHISKEY CREEK raced well off the pace inside the first turn then angled to the outside entering the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
 improved in the five path of the far turn, lugged in down the lane then flattened stride nearing the wire. NORTHERN LUCK saved ground off the early pace
 then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled in while steadying on the far turn then drifted outward through the stretch.
 ATTEMPT TO DREAM tapered in through the front stretch and rated the pace two deep from the five eighths pole, raced clear into the backstretch, was
 pressured from the seven sixteenths pole, headed at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened from the top of the lane. NYE settled off the pace and off
 the rail the first turn then showed little response through the backstretch. ORBIT tapered in through the front stretch to race with the pace, dropped back
 past the half mile pole and was through after a half mile.

 Footnotes
 HURRICANE JOSIE rated close about the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, dueled to the front in the upper stretch, raced clear a sixteenth away
 and widened in later yards. POWDERCOAT was hustled along inside to set a pressured pace, dueled clear midway on the turn, headed past the eighth pole
 then ceded the final sixteenth. SILKEN LADY bobbled leaving the gate then pressured the pace two deep, dropped back leaving the turn then faded down
 the lane. NATIVE RED CLOUD chased the early pace from the outside, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and finished evenly to pass tiring rivals.
 LINEA VERDE hopped at the break then picked up the chase leaving the chute, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and proved empty down the
 lane. FANTASTIC CROSSING raced well off the pace toward the outside, rounded the turn in the six path and finished evenly. DEPUTIZED engaged in
 clear early chase toward the outside, angled in past the three eighths pole, raced near the rail rounding the turn, then drifted into the stretch and weakened.
 HURRICANE MISS hesitated at the break and was not a factor. PRETTY PERSISTANT angled to the outside to give chase through the backstretch then
 rounded the turn off the rail.
