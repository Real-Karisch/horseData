 Footnotes
 PLAY IT FORWARD was away in good order then lodged her bid from the outside and drove to the front in time. RIVERWALK WEEKEND was checked on
 the turn after 3/8 while trying to get out then continued willingly along the inside rail to get up for second. HOUSE WINE moved up along the inside through
 the backstretch to give chase and finished gamely to just miss for second. KNIGHT SPRING saved ground, shook clear on the turn then weakened in deep
 stretch. BACKYARD BOOGIE broke alertly and prompted the pace then lacked the needed closing kick. KEEP IN MIND failed to be a threat. M'LADY
 PENNY dropped back steadily after an alertly break.

 DON'T ASK ME WHY dueled in the five path, shook loose to be clear in mid stretch, began to shorten stride in deep stretch and lasted. CATCH AH FLIGHT
 was outrun early, raced and rallied very wide, was carried wider by DRAGON TATTOO into stretch, drifted in, while clear in deep stretch and closed well.
 EXOTIC APPEAL, racing in the four path, eased out wider entering the stretch and then split rivals but was too late. KAREN'S CHIANTI, in the four path and
 just off pace, drifted out entering stretch, drifted in through deep stretch while not being persevered. SHE'S A DANDY LION hesitated and then was bumped
 leaving the gate, raced wide and caught the leaders on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and faltered. DRAGON TATTOO raced wide, drifted wider
 racing into stretch and then was steadied in tight between foes in deep stretch. MRS. MARY S came out and bumped foe leaving the gate, dueled in the
 three path and had nothing left. CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF DRAGON TATTOO AGAINST BOTH EXOTIC APPEAL AND CATCH AH FLIGHT
 FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WERE BOTH DISMISSED.

 Footnotes
 BROAD LOVER chased from the six path, rallied to the lead on the far turn, moved closer to the rail while opening a clear lead with a furlong to run and held
 on under strong handling. BROAD LOVER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST. HE FORFEITED ALL PURSE MONIES.
 PURIM'S GOLD raced wide throughout, took up chase entering the stretch but had no late gain. WELLINGTON WIZARD, outrun early racing between foes,
 drifted out through stretch and wasn't a serious threat. MORE HUNDRED ACRE broke slowly, raced wide and failed to menace. D'MARIN steadied in tight
 racing into the first turn, was between foes and tired. MOON TRAVELER moved to the outside, was very wide on the final turn and through the stretch.
 CHASE LANE, wide, failed to menace. KODIAK SYD broke slowly and showed little. STREET CHIEF steadied briefly in tight on the final turn and gave way.
 TUCKED IN FRONT set the pace in the five path and stopped.

 TIN N LINT showed the way racing in the two path, bumped with LOVE ON FIRE on the turn and was kept to steady pressure to edge clear. LOVE ON
 FIRE pressed the winner from the inside, bumped with that rival on the turn and continued on gamely in the drive. RISQUE'S DIAMOND got out at the start
 and gained well late to close a gap for the show. WEEKEND BABE raced a bit green and responded well in the drive. BEAUTIFUL LADY broke sharp to
 give chase and lacked the needed response. TIME TO WINK chased the top two into the final furlong and faded. ALEXIA showed little. ZENBENNIE was
 outrun. BEFORE showed little. WITH WINGS was no factor. A claim of foul by the rider of LOVE ON FIRE against the winner for interference on the turn
 was dismissed by the stewards.

 wide, took the lead leaving the turn, was clear in mid stretch and just lasted. WEST HILLS GIANT also bobbled leaving the gate, raced very wide and was
 gaining. YEAH ROCKY broke sharply, angled in a bit, set the pace in four path and held on gamely. MR. ROMANCE split rivals moving on the turn, angled
 out and closed. COURT NOTE, very wide, failed to menace. DARK ROAST, just off the rail and just off the pace, faded. OLIVER RUSH was wide and failed
 to menace. J R'S RHYTHM broke slowly, was hustled up along the rail, stalked and then gave way. COLLIN'S SMILE broke slowly and had brief speed.
 AVERYON, wide and just off the pace, tired.

 Footnotes
 ALL D' NIGHT, outside while outrun early, rallied very wide on the final turn, swung ten wide into stretch, challenged with a furlong to run and drew off.
 MODERN HARMONY broke slowly, moved up between foes, took the lead near the furlong grounds but then was unable to hold off winner. SAFFI was also
 outrun early, split rivals on the final turn and passed tiring foes. ROYAL STAGE, very wide while stalking the pace, tired. KRISTINITE eased off the rail and
 split rivals on the backstretch, took the lead on final turn and then gave way. TOTALLY GAGA, between rivals early, eased out and challenged three wide
 but then tired. HOUSE RED raced wide and dropped back. SHE'S OVERWELMING set the early pace in the four path and had little left. SOUR LEMON
 DROP broke slowly and showed little. NANCY'S GONE WILD, just off the rail and just off the pace, stopped.
