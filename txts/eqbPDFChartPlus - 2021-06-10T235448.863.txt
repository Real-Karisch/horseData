 LOUDER CALIFORNIA settled early, advanced in the two path up the backstretch, swung out into the five path on the turn, rallied from the outside and
 closed fast to catch MISS NAPPER TANDY in the final strides. MISS NAPPER TANDY broke in, well placed behind the speed, bid along the inside and
 gained command in the stretch, cleared briefly but was overtaken by the winner. BLESS THE CAUSE vied from the inside, carried the lead from the two
 path into the stretch, fought through the lane but weakened in the final sixteenth. SPACERIKA unhurried in the beginning, raced off the rail, angled in on the
 turn, showed a mild response to urging and improved position. LIL' A. J. vied between runners to the turn, fought between runners and three wide into the
 stretch, then weakened in the late stages. BABY BEAUTY vied three deep, four wide exiting the turn and gave way. BLAZING MISS saved ground trailing
 the field and never threatened.

 FANDAREL DANCER away quickly from the start then stalked the leader from the inside, angled out into the stretch, rallied and reeled in the foe to win
 going away under urging. ANGRY BOBBY bumped at the start, raced outside a rival then a bit off the rail into the stretch, rallied late and got up to share the
 place honors. ROCK N DOC off a bit slow to begin, recovered to show speed, attained the lead then gained a clear advantage, led through the stretch but
 could not contain the winner. YODELERS WAY chased off the rail, two wide into the turn, moved out four wide around the bend and finished with interest. P
 TOWN TITAN showed early speed from the outside then dropped back a bit to chase the leader, entered the turn three deep, exited four wide and
 weakened in the lane. BALLYCASTLE broke out and bumped then shifted in at the start, chased from the inside, came out leaving the turn and never
 threatened.
