 TAKAHIRO'S DREAM saved ground and moved to the front passing the quarter pole then drew out while being ridden out. BUDDUG was angled inward
 entering the stretch and earned the place. GEE CEE CEE sprinted clear heading into the turn, drifted out some into the lane then was outfinished for the
 place. PANOCHIO raced five wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. EMMA'S CANDY was in the seven path into the stretch and had no rally.
 KEY MONEY saved ground and weakened on the turn. RUBY GOLD broke a bit awkwardly then moved up, bolted turning for home and was eased up.

 UNCLE STEVE'S GIRL bumped at the start, pressed the pace to the turn, assumed command, inched clear and held well. CELESTIALCHRISTINA bumped
 at the start, rallied on the turn to loom a threat, swung six wide entering the stretch, bid willingly and didn't have enough late. TWO STEPS OF GLORY set
 the pace to the turn, weakened, fell back and was all out for show. BIG ALICE trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. GOOD N NAUGHTY pressed the
 pace while racing inside, dropped back and gave way.

 PONTIFICATOR vied early inside, drew clear on the turn then edged away through the final furlong while being ridden out. STORM STALKER prompted the
 early issue three deep, chased three wide on the turn, drifted in nearing the eighth pole and lacked the needed response while saving the place. QUEEN
 LILLY KAY up close early, gave ground on the turn, raced in the four path into the stretch and offered a gradual late gain. PERFECTLY SEASONED vied for
 the early lead between foes and tired in the drive.

 Footnotes
 FIGHT ON FOREVER contended two across to the eighth pole, drew off for a clear lead, was shortening strides late and held off the late charge of DUST
 ROLLER. DUST ROLLER raced mid pack, shifted out in the upper stretch, finished well and was gaining ground. PACKY'S OUT broke out and bumped at
 the start, trailed the field, went seven wide leaving the turn and closed to earn show. ROSAT bobbled and brushed at the start, vied inside to the eighth pole,
 fell back, altered course and lost momentum. PASHITO lagged early, closed steadily and narrowed the gap while failed to menace. MAC MCLOVIN broke
 out, was never far off the pace, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, bid and came up empty. PIPER PEGASUS was outrun in an even effort. PUNDY
 hesitated at the start to be off slowly, was hustled along inside and came up empty in the drive. GRAND CRYSTAL was not a factor. OVER EZ bumped at
 the start and did not threaten.
