 Footnotes
 SAMMIE SUNSHINE battled for the early lead innermost of a foursome, shook clear around the turn, was put to pressure at the top of the stretch, and
 extended the margin while drifting out. NOTHINS FREE had aim tracking a four-way scrum up the backstretch, was roused and moved up three wide
 around the turn, shifted inward turning for home and could not menace the winner while best of the others. FORTY KILOS was shuffled back early between
 rivals, raced three wide and outfinished MEMBER for the show spot. MEMBER lagged well back for a half-mile, came four wide off the turn and was no
 threat. HELEN ROSE contested the pace widest of four early, gradually moved inward on the turn and tired. MAGNATO GO battled between rivals in the
 two-path early, was shuffled back and steadied near the half-mile pole, and had nothing left. GOLDA took part in the early scrimmage for the lead in the
 three-path, could not keep pace around the turn and moved inside while tiring.

 Footnotes
 KITZEL PARK bumped with EXPECT AN ENTRY at the start but quickly gained command inside, rated along and edged away on the far turn, responded to
 pressure when set down at the top of the lane and remained clear while drifting out. EXPECT AN ENTRY bumped with KITZEL PARK at the start, raced in
 striking range early under a firm hold, shifted off the rail beginning a rally late on the far turn, had a clear shot through the lane but could not reach the
 winner. LA DEFENDER hopped and broke in at the start, then stumbled a couple of awkward strides later, saved ground well back for a half-mile, swung
 four wide into the stretch and finished with good determination to get up for third on the far outside. TROPICALITY was reserved early in the two-path,
 rallied mildly three wide turning for home, and was outkicked late for third. SO FRESH lacked speed three wide early, moved a bit closer to the inside
 around the far turn and posed no threat. LYDIA'S WAY fought restraint chasing outside KITZEL PARK around the first turn, was empty when asked and
 dropped back abruptly between horses with a quarter-mile remaining.

 Footnotes
 COMPETITIVE PLAYER steadied being shuffled back between rivals in the opening furlong, closed in on the leading trio late on the turn, rallied four wide
 gaining command past the eighth-pole and moved clear under a drive. PURE BLISS was outrun two wide early, swung five wide off the turn, and earned a
 share of second despite attempting to lug in late. THERE GOES BELLA dueled outside ITALIAN SMILE to the turn, edged away a bit being chased by three
 pursuers with a quarter-mile left, could not hold off COMPETITIVE PLAYER inside the final furlong, but held well enough to salvage a share of second.
 ITALIAN SMILE hustled up on the rail to contest the pace inside THERE GOES BELLA, remained prominent to upper stretch and weakened.
 COQUIVACOA had a clear shot off the duelers around the turn, bid three wide at the top of the lane, then flattened out through the drive. DR. COTTON JEN
 saved ground throughout and was outrun. QUEEN ROLLER raced four to five wide and failed to threaten.

 Footnotes
 SPANISH HARLEM tracked the leaders from close range, rallied three wide to put a head in front of FAITH N HOPE after five furlongs, took charge through
 upper stretch and drew off. DORITZA was slow into stride and trailed inside early, came off the rail approaching the eighth-pole and was along in the last
 strides for second. FAITH N HOPE dueled outside NIKKI BELLA for just over a half-mile, could not match strides with SPANISH HARLEM turning for home,
 and lost second late inside. SHE TAKES HEART saved ground early, shifted out three wide near the stretch and could not gain. NO SWEAT wandered in
 soon after the start having to be pulled off SHE TAKES HEART, and had no response under pressure four wide and between horses late on the turn. NIKKI
 BELLA dueled inside FAITH N HOPE, and dropped back coming to the five-sixteenths marker. THREE ILLUSIONS raced widest early in range, but made
 no headway in the five-path around the turn. SWEET DISTINCTION raced four to five wide and dropped far back after a half-mile.

 Footnotes
 LOVE AND LEMONS battled for the lead between rivals for three furlongs, remained stride for stride outside DRINKS ON MAGGIE coming off the turn, and
 prevailed after a stretch-long struggle. DRINKS ON MAGGIE hustled through on the rail for a slim lead while hounded through the first three furlongs, fought
 on stubbornly inside LOVE AND LEMONS through the drive and narrowly missed. FLYING EMERALD sat just off the leading trio toward the inside early,
 had the rider lose the whip while lacking a clear path approaching the quarter-pole, came open in the three-path in midstretch and finished willingly under
 vigorous hand urging. ALL IN GIRL lagged well back two wide coming off the turn, found her best stride in midstretch between foes and finished well too
 late. NOT NICE took the worst of things bumping solidly with GOLDEN ROSIE at the break, then bumped lightly with DISCREET GAL, steadied slightly
 soon after that, cut the corner into the stretch and finished up one-paced on the fence. VENEZUELAN SPIRIT raced three wide on the turn, and gained
 mildly outside late without threatening. DISCREET GAL bumped lightly with NOT NICE after the start, pressed the pace three wide and faded through upper
 stretch. GOLDEN ROSIE bumped solidly with NOT NICE at the start, stayed in range three wide to the stretch and tired. VALIDITY steadied slightly entering
 the turn, saved ground and failed to menace. GO GIRL GONE lacked speed, drifted very wide off the turn and remained outrun. VINO DE PAGO broke
 slowly, trailed inside to the stretch and could not gain. ASH FLOWER dropped back around the turn and showed little.

 Footnotes
 WILD CHATTER steadied a bit going to the first turn, was allowed to settle in midpack, rallied four wide coming off the far turn, and nailed CAJUN QUEEN
 from the outside near the wire. CAJUN QUEEN vied for the lead on the rail going to the first turn, then backed off deferring to PATIENT DIGNA, stalked
 through the middle stages, rebid outside and reached the front turning for home, and was overhauled in the last strides. FINAL FLURRY bumped with
 IMAGE OF RACHEL going to the first turn, lodged a bid along the rail through the stretch and fought on gamely to the finish. PATIENT DIGNA went up three
 wide looking for the lead into the opening bend, cleared over to the inside showing the way entering the backstretch, could not handle CAJUN QUEEN at
 the top of the lane and weakened. LAMONTAGNE raced three wide early, stayed in range in the two-path around the far turn, shifted out with aim when
 straightened away but was outkicked. LAPANTALONES FANCE steadied from between CAJUN QUEEN and PATIENT DIGNA on the first turn, chased
 those two three wide to the far turn and faded. VINYARDNINA saved ground and was outrun. MY COTTON ROSE steadied behind the incident going to the
 first turn, came three wide off the far turn and finished on her own courage. IMAGE OF RACHEL bumped with FINAL FLURRY approaching the first turn,
 became rough-gaited being taken up and bearing out a moment later, and was finished after a half-mile. MIGHTY PATIENT bumped with PRADO VISION
 going to the first turn, then stumbled over that fallen foe with the rider losing both irons a moment later, and walked off after the finish. PRADO VISION was
 in tight between horses going to the first turn, bumped with MIGHTY PATIENT, stumbled and fell unseating the rider, got up and galloped around the
 course, then was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT GOING TO THE FIRST TURN BEFORE
 THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

 Footnotes
 GLOBAL BEAUTY COCO dashed to the front at the start, shook off FIRST TIME PROUD into upper stretch and was driving on the rail to keep clear. FIRST
 TIME PROUD came away in good order pressing the pace four wide, shifted in a couple paths challenging GLOBAL BEAUTY COCO from the outside
 approaching the stretch, could not stay with that one and was best of the others. AWESOME PARK was sandwiched between MARDI GRAS GIRL and
 LEGACY TO GOLD at the start, raced two to three wide in midpack and finished evenly. LAILONI lacked speed despite being asked away from the gate,
 raced four to five wide and passed tired horses. JOLIE BAY steadied on the rail early behind the loose horse, raced two to three wide around the turn and
 improved position without becoming a factor. LEGACY TO GOLD broke in bumping AWESOME PARK into MARDI GRAS GIRL, veered in greenly nearly
 striking the rail midway up the backstretch, went out four wide around the turn and never got close. AVOCADO TOAST chased two wide early, moved inside
 and tired. TREASURED INFO pressed the early pace three wide and tired. PRECOCIOUS MISS became fractious unseating the rider behind the gate and
 fell lightly, had the rider remount and balked at loading before finally being coerced into the gate, then broke slowly and was always far back. MARDI GRAS
 GIRL was bumped solidly and pushed in unseating the rider after the start, was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARD'S INQUIRY
 INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

 Footnotes
 LITTLE CHRISTINA stalked the duelers saving ground on the turn, found room on the rail into the stretch, reached the front inside the last sixteenth and
 inched away under good handling. MEANT TOBE MINE pressed the pace outside EILA from the get-go, bid three wide through the stretch and was edged
 after a long drive. EILA set a pressured pace inside early, faced challenges from both flanks in the two-path turning for home, and fought on gamely
 between foes before yielding grudgingly. Y'ALL saved ground to the stretch, shifted outside and gained some ground without threatening. SLY ROXY raced
 two wide to the stretch and could not gain. UNBRIDLED COURAGE failed to become a factor after taking the turn in the two-path. CORDELE came widest
 into the lane and was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 REASON TO SOAR followed along patiently behind the leading trio around the turn, was guided out widest with three-sixteenths to go, and was up on the
 far outside in the closing yards. FRONT LOADED pressed the pace outside SMALL FORTUNE early, challenged between horses through a long drive and
 fought on gamely to just miss. BARRY KARAFIN BETS was never far back, launched a bid three wide turning for home, and kept on gamely between
 horses to the finish. SMALL FORTUNE broke in bumping THANKS GOD at the start, sped to the front slightly off the rail up the backstretch, faced three
 challengers through the lane and yielded stubbornly late inside. TWENTY AND FOUR raced three to four wide and faded around the turn. QUINIENTOS
 hopped at the start and was off behind the field, went two wide on the turn and was never in the hunt. THE BEST CANDY dropped back three wide after a
 half-mile. THANKS GOD was bumped by SMALL FORTUNE at the start, and dropped far back after going a half.

 DELICIOUS PURSUIT cleared from RAHY MOMENTA heading into the turn, settled into the stretch well in command, and was under a mild drive to the
 sixteenth-pole while drifting out a bit and coasting in. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN bumped with WILD IN RED at the start, lagged well back three wide to the top
 of the stretch, and finished strongly too late. WISHFULLY chased inside from the start, and kept on with good courage while being outkicked for the
 runner-up spot. RAHY MOMENTA pressed the pace inside DELICIOUS PURSUIT to the turn, remained prominent two wide into the stretch and was
 outfinished for larger shares. DIXIE GRITS was put to the whip early saving ground, came wide off the turn and could not gain appreciably. PERFECT
 STATE raced in striking range three wide to the lane and lacked a rally. WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT saved ground into the stretch and could not muster the
 needed response. MISS LOTUS FLOWER bumped with WILD IN RED at the start, raced five wide and was outrun. DANCING GIA saved ground and was
 never close. WILD IN RED was sawed off at the start between rivals, pulled three wide to the turn, dropped back into the lane, and was vanned off after the
 finish. MUCHO MEDIA raced wide and was finished early.
