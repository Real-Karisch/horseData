 Footnotes
 DELSMOKE got away alertly, settled in behind the leaders along the fence into the first turn, switched off the inside heading up the backstretch and given a
 little encouragement, took closer order three wide into the far turn, struck a narrow lead leaving that bend and edged away late under steady handling.
 COME HOME CHANCE set the pace initially off the rail pressed by LADY SUZZETT, was challenged by DELSMOKE on the far turn as LADY SUZZETT
 dropped back but was no match while clearly second best. LADY SUZZETT pressed the pace three wide from the outset, weakened but held show.
 PICTURE TIME was unhurried at the rear, advanced past rivals two deep through the far turn, came out in upper stretch but could make no headway late.
 PRINCESS JADA switched out heading into the first turn to track mid-division from about the three to four path, given her cue outside the three-eighths pole
 but had no response and was empty for the drive. IT'S ABOUT ALEX raced well off the inside in the four to five path making a mild advance into the far turn
 but flattened out thereafter. MISS INDIAN WHO saved ground and made no bid.

 Footnotes
 BLUEGRASS BANJO exchanged a bump at the break, tracked inside, bit up the rail turning for home, had a clear lead in upper stretch and dug in to last.
 SIDEPOCKET CHARGER mid-pack outside foes early, went five to six wide on the turn, came in a bit in upper stretch and gained steadily but missed.
 JACKIE STAR off the early leaders, advanced four wide on the turn, came out seven deep in mid-strech and fought on to gain show honors. SHAKURA in
 range between foes four to five wide on the turn, evened out in the drive. GRAMMYSPERFECTSTAR chased the pace from off the inside mostly three wide
 through the turn, weakened in the stretch. SHADOW ME GRAY exchanged a light bump early, settled toward the back, shifted eight wide in the stretch and
 gained belatedly. TOPAZ JEWEL exchanged a bump at the break, saved ground through much of the turn before coming into the stretch three deep, ran on
 evenly. DEPUTY LAWSON exchanged a bump shortly after the start, chased inside a foe but off the rail in about the three path on the turn angling seven
 deep at the the top of the stretch, had no rally. YOUR RON was loaded riderless, sped clear, faltered and faded. CITI SHINER chased the pacesetter near
 the inside, tired. EASY TARGET broke a step slowly and was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 RISKY REVENGE set the early tempo, was pressured by an outside foe, dispatched that rival while racing off the rail a bit into upper stretch, faced a
 challenger from inside but held that rival at bay. DRINKIN FIRE WATER tracked in behind the leaders from off the fence, shifted in leaving the quarter pole,
 made a mild bid inside in upper stretch but couldn't get past. STACKING ROCKS was within range early racing outside foes wide, took slightly closer order
 three to four wide on the turn coming into the stretch five deep and had no extra late. SIXTH GEAR settled mid-pack, saved ground into the turn coming out
 a path leaving that bend then a further path once in upper stretch, ran evenly. BINGHAM'S FLASH was lightly brushed at the break, prompted the pace from
 outside, weakened. LET'S WAGER veered out at the break, settled inside a foe well back, shifted out entering the stretch then back in and ran on mildly.
 ENGAGEMENT RING raced a bit erratically in the early going while inside a rival but off the fence, went in about the three path through the turn shifting out
 a further two paths in the stretch and ran evenly. SURF N DELMAR failed to threaten while racing a few paths removed from the rail.
 FIGHTINFORTHELEAD chased while in close range early, went three to four wide on the turn and was empty in the stretch. GOLD BROTHER broke
 inwardly brushing a rival, failed to threaten but showed mild late interest. PANTHER MOON was reluctant to load and entered the stalls riderless, broke a
 step slowly and was in tight leaving the gate, failed to threaten.
