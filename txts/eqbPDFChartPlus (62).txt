 FOREST CHATTER angled in and stalked inside, went outside a rival leaving the turn and into the stretch, rallied to gain the advantage three wide in deep
 stretch and inched away under a crack of the whip and good handling. JOE JACKSON saved ground stalking the pace, came off the rail in midstretch and
 edged a rival for the place. ROCKY ROGUE stalked outside then angled in and dueled outside a rival, was carried out a bit into the stretch, fought back in
 the drive, was between foes in deep stretch and was edged for second. NORTH COUNTY GUY broke out and bumped a rival, stalked inside, swung out
 three deep into the stretch and put in a late run at a minor award. RED WINE AND DINE sped to the early lead, dueled inside, came out a bit into the
 stretch, drifted in and fought back in the drive and was outkicked for a minor share. MINOSO dropped back and angled in, settled outside a rival, angled to
 the inside in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. FROM THE DISTANCE bobbled sharply and was bumped soundly at the break, pulled inside then
 came out off heels to be three deep on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. HOSS CARTWRIGHT stalked
 between horses or outside a rival, continued a bit off the rail leaving the turn and weakened. SCHULACE between rivals early, chased three deep to the
