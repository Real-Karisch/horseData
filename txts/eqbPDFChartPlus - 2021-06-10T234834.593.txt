 Footnotes
 RED BEAN SONDE rated a clear lead just off the rail, dug in to the challenge of Top Pick midway on the turn and held on well under steady handling. TOP
 PICK engaged in close chase from the three and four paths and challenged the winner midway on the turn, but ultimately, dueled to maintain second.
 CLERESTORY chased the pace inside and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE chased the pace toward the outside,
 rounded the turn about the four path and finished evenly. ALLEGHENY DBL LIME gave chase from well back, raced at the rail on the turn and finished
 evenly. BERRY STRONG angled to the outside to give chase, raced in the five path of the turn, though, showed little in the lane. NURSE NICKY chased the
 pace toward the inside, drifted leaving the turn and showed little in the lane.

 Footnotes
 ROCK OF WINDSOR angled in to set a pressured pace then dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on. SILKEN BELLE chased the pace from
 the three path but lost momentum off the heels of the waning Mesmerizingpegasus past the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride into the turn, was carried
 to the six path leaving the turn but dug in under a strong drive to take second late yards while gaining on the winner. ODDSEVERINURFAVOR chased the
 pace toward the outside, drifted leaving the turn and was outfinished in a later duel for second. GOLDEN DESIRE angled to the outside to give chase, raced
 in the six and seven paths on the turn and passed fading rivals down the lane. MESMERIZINGPEGASUS pressured the early pace inside but dropped back
 past the five sixteenths pole and proved empty from the head of the turn. SHARP engaged in close early chase three wide and stayed in range of the lead
 through the turn, but, faded in the lane. PUNKY BOO broke her right hind leg shortly after the start and had to be euthanized on the track.

 Footnotes
 HERO'S MAN took quick control to rate the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and turned back the challenge of On The
 Lam from that point, widened at the rail rounding the far turn and was steadily handled to deep stretch before being allowed to relax a bit. TOTALITARIO
 rated close inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the turn then dueled through the stretch to take second later yards. ON THE
 LAM stalked the winner two deep then challenged that one leaving the seven sixteenths pole, appeared a close factor to the mid point of the far turn but
 gave way to the winner and relented in the stretch duel for second. MACANAO raced well back and could only close the gap. BURNIN RING O FIRE
 stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn but showed little
 more. C THE KING raced well back off the rail the opening turn and proved no factor.

 Footnotes
 MISS CASUARINA took the lead three wide approaching the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under some pressure leaving the far turn and
 held on well. TIZ JOHNNIE stalked the pace two deep then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and held on for
 second while unable to gain on the winner. PIKI PIKI GIRL settled off the pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on
 the far turn and finished evenly. DEMAY'S CASTLE had the lead through the front stretch then stalked from the nine sixteenths pole, picked up the chase
 toward the three eighths, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. DROPS AND BUCKETS rounded the first turn five wide and settled well off
 the pace leaving the turn, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but angled to the five path into the lane and
 passed some rivals. JAGGER BABY settled off the pace in the three path the first turn and showed only mild response through the backstretch. LOVE THAT
 CHICK saved ground off the pace and showed little response after a half mile. TRULYWICKED raced four wide the opening turn then showed little response
 past the three eighths pole.

 under the wire. MOM'S MAGIC chased the pace toward the outside, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly for third. INSIDIOUS CAT
