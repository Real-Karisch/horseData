 chased the pace and weakened. BREAK THE MOLD raced along the inner rail on the turn and was no factor. FIFTIES MUSIC bobbled at the break, chased
 the pace two wide around the turn and gave way. ARNINA was outrun. FANTASTIC KITTEN stumbled leaving the starting gate, circled the turn and was
 outrun. VALID REDEEMER , in tight quarters soon after the break, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 SLEWZER bore out at the break straightened and vied three deep, moved clear into the turn, dropped in and set the pace, was guided back out to three
 path entering the lane, kept on under right handed rousing in mid stretch, turned away an outside threat and held firm. GIVEN ACHANCE angled out near
 the half mile marker, gained four wide under urging mid turn, shifted out a bit wider into the lane, ranged up outside the winner in mid stretch, failed to match
 strides but stayed willingly to the wire. CHEROKEE JAM had speed between rivals, rated back near the half and angled out, came back nearing the quarter
 pole, chased between into the lane and faded. DONNA'S DELIGHT broke a step slow and was outrun. CALADONIA had speed inside foes, failed to keep
 up leaving the far turn, pursued to upper stretch then tired. TIZ OCTAVIA broke slowly, raced well back into the turn, bolted leaving the quarter pole, was
 corrected but failed to threaten.

 Footnotes
 PRINCETONIAN settled in mid pack while raving to the outside of SPEEDY SLEW, saw that one open up on him leaving the three sixteenths, shifted out
 and leveled off when put to the left stick leaving the furlong grounds, kept on grinding and got up in the final jumps. SPEEDY SLEW rated to the inside of the
 winner mid turn, angled out and commenced a run entering the lane, closed wide under pressure, struck the top with a sixteenth to, kept on gamely but just
 failed to contain the winner. CRIMSON SECRET vied two to three wide outside a rival, shook clear under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, ceded to the
 winner a sixteenth from home but continued trying and saved the show. MAGICIAN'S BAGS stalked two to three wide, shifted out in mid stretch, had aim on
 the leaders near the sixteenth marker but could only muster up a mild kick. THROUGH APPALACHIA dueled inside CRIMSON SECRET to upper stretch,
 remained a presence to the sixteenth pole and faded. ZAPATA stalked inside, got through along the rail in upper stretch but one paced through the final
 furlong. TIGHTLY BRIDLED was taken to rate, steadied nearing the turn, regrouped to save some ground, angled out in the drive but failed to generate a
 solid finish. HOPKINS CHOICE failed to menace. MR J was outrun. GATOR BOY trailed.

 BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN stalked the pace three wide around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, switched to her left lead near the sixteenth pole and dug
 in under brisk urging. HEAVEN'S DOOR , pinched back soon after the break, raced off the rail on the turn, swung to the five path at the head of the stretch
 and closed outside horses. BRING ME ANSWERS , eased out to the four path entering the stretch, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out.
 BALHARBOUR MISS raced inside horses, chased the pace and weakened. MY GOLDEN ROSE circled the turn three wide, floated to the four path entering
 the stretch and failed to rally. AFRICAN WILDCAT stumbled leaving the starting gate, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones.
 ANDIEMAC raced between horses and was not a factor. SPICY GIRL RED hugged the inner rail on the turn and weakened. MIDNIGHT RODEO prompted
 the pace two wide around the turn and faltered in upper stretch. UNBRIDLED ESCAPE set the pace along the rail and faltered in upper stretch.
 BALEROOM DANCER raced inside horses and was no factor. NAIRET , no factor, was five deep turning for home.

 SIPPIN'ONBUBBLES vied outside of KEEP IT UP, moved to command nearing the far turn, kicked clear and was nursed along past the five sixteenths, kept
 on under a steady drive from the head of the lane and kept CHANT DAVID CHANT at bay. CHANT DAVID CHANT was taken wide for the backstretch run,
 rolled up five wide nearing the far turn, dropped in a bit and chased the winner from the five sixteenths, failed to get by but stayed willingly enough to hold
 the place. BOWSPRIT , forwardly placed between rivals, saved ground through the final three eighths and churned on willingly. KID JETER , up close four
 wide nearing the half mile marker, chased three wide into the lane and came up empty. QUALITY COUNTS saved ground early, eased out and moved
 between foes leaving the far turn, swung wide for the drive and had a mild gain. GALAXY EXPRESS , unhurried early, eased off the inside around the final
 turn, steadied behind rivals in upper stretch, altered out and kept on with interest. BOMBONERO , between rivals in early backstretch, failed to keep pace
 leaving the far turn. KEEP IT UP , a bit rank at the break, made the early lead, was pressured from his outside by the winner, ceded to that one near the
 half, steadied in close around the far turn, dropped back then angled out in the drive. LOVE'S LEGEND stalked behind rivals nearing the far turn and faded.
 MY OWN LANE , four and three wide, bid near the half then weakened. GAME NIGHT steadied between rivals around the first turn and failed to menace.

 BESTKINDOFTROUBLE gained the lead outside SUNRISE SUNSET on the turn, entered the stretch in the three path, opened up in mid stretch and
 prevailed under energetic urging. TRICKY LION , three wide between horses on the turn, drifted to the four path entering the stretch and lacked the needed
 late response. VICTORY CHIMES , five deep on the turn, was floated to the six path entering the stretch and offered a mild gain outside foes. EASTERN
 BAY hugged the inner rail much of the race and failed to menace. SUNRISE SUNSET showed speed, saved ground on the turn and gave way in the drive.
 MARTYWITHTHEPARTY stalked the pace two wide between horses to the stretch and gave way. DUNDALK advanced four deep leaving the turn to reach
 a striking position then gave way. MINOR LEGEND trailed.

 Footnotes
 NORTHERN ECLIPSE vied outside BIOTERP before shaking clear around the far turn, was rated along around the turn, kicked away under pressure
 leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under strong handling through the final furlong, was joined by BIOTERP in deep stretch and dug in gamely to prevail.
 BIOTERP , away alertly, vied inside the winner, steadied off that one nearing the turn, steadied again mid turn, altered out in upper stretch and came back
 gamely. SYCEE came in at the break and bumped with a rival, steadied back from between foes soon after, saved ground, eased out in the drive and had a
 mild rally. ELEGANT SUPERMODEL (GER) , off the pace, came five wide for the drive and had a mild rally. MORE'N LIKELY , four wide off the pace, failed
 to respond. EYE ON BERLIN stalked the pace three wide, remained in range to the three sixteenths then gave way. SUMMER FROCK , bumped at the
 break, raced three wide between foes mid turn, shifted in some and failed to rally. DI COLAS COWGIRL was off last after being unprepared and never
 menaced. UNTAMED DIXIE , brushed at the break, stalked towards the inside, eased out briefly leaving the three eighths, angled back in and gave way.
