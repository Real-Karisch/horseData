 Footnotes
 FLYING GHOST raced off the early pace, closed midway through the backstretch, stalked the pace from the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied
 and got by late under a strong hand ride. ERADICATOR showed early speed, was headed late backstretch, forced the pace, rebid a furlong out, gained a
 narrow lead but failed to hold the winner safe. NIGHT WATCHMAN forced the issue, dueled late backstretch, edged ahead and set a pressured on the turn
 then gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. STORM HAWK briefly forced the pace, chased in range on the turn then finished gamely in vain. LITTLE
 DEUCE COUPE broke outward, settled in midpack, chased three and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace. RED CHILL raced off the pace, closed on
 the backstretch, chased along the rail through the turn then evened out in the stretch.

 RIO NORTE brushed lightly with LILLZ PEARL leaving the gate, had command early, set the pace, drifted from the rail to three-wide late turn then held
 sway under steady encouragement. SPANISH EXPRESS broke alertly then settled in midpack, came three and four-wide through the turn and rallied
 gamely outside. LILLZ PEARL pressed the pace, angled from two to four-wide late turn, chased into the stretch but weakened in the late stages. SILENT
 FLASH raced in midpack, was hustled two-wide on the turn then finished evenly. MAJESTIC FEVER dropped back early, saved ground, angled out in the
 stretch but found his best stride late. FRONT NINE settled in midpack, saved ground on the turn but lacked a closing response.

 LAKE MANITOU settled in midpack, angled from two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied outside, bid midstretch and prevailed
 under a drive. DESERT POEM bumped with SAMS DESTINY at the start, stalked the pace, closed four-wide late turn, bid upper stretch and drew clear but
 was engaged midstretch and gave way grudgingly. SAMS DESTINY, bumped at the outset, raced off the pace, closed three-wide late turn and finished all
 out. SWEET SILENT SOUL bobbled leaving, shook clear briefly then stalked the pacesetter, chased into the stretch, gave way a bit with a furlong to run
 then moved out a little looking for a clear run then came on late. NIGHT GATHERS (IRE) led midway of the backstretch, set the pace, was passed upper
 stretch and gave way. ANGELICAL, away slowly, raced from off the pace, was hustled late turn but never reached contention. DIAMOND VISION settled in
 midpack, saved ground on the turn but flattened out in the final 16th. SHAUNESSY broke outward, raced in midpack, came three to five-wide through the
 turn then flattened out in the stretch.

 PRIDDY FAIR led briefly, was headed mid backstretch, stalked the new pacesetter, came two and three-wide through the turn, was set down at the top of
 the stretch, regained command a 16th out and drove clear. BRITANNIA PENNY forced the issue, led mid backstretch, set the pace, was headed midstretch
 but held place. GEOCENTRIC pressed the pace, raced three and four-wide through the turn then finished gamely. CAPTURE YOUR HEART stalked the
 pace in hand, saved ground then finished evenly. WOLVERINA'S WILLA raced off the pace, angled from two to four-wide through the turn, finished outside
 rivals but did not menace. LAKE MARION hopped at the outset, moved up to stalk the pace, was shuffled back at the turn and lacked a rally.
 BENADETTE'S LADY settled in midpack, chased three-wide on the turn but offered no response in the stretch.

 SAFE TO SAY settled in midpack, closed three to five-wide on the turn, bid near the top of the stretch but drifted out losing ground, dug in, collared the
 leader a 16th out and drew clear under light handling. SPLIT THE SEA led onto the main track, set the pace, turned back rivals at the top of the stretch but
 failed to hold the winner safe in the late stages. FAIRY HILL stalked the pace, chased into the stretch and finished gamely between foes. MIDNIGHT FLASH
 stalked the pace, moved between foes early on the backstretch, raced two and three-wide on the turn, angled out upper stretch and tendered a mild rally. L.
 A. HOUSE settled at the rear of the pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, was in striking range upper stretch but lacked a kick.
 MEET YOU AT HOME also began at the rear of the pack, chased two to four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally. SAVANNAH ROXANNA forced the pace,
 angled four-wide late turn and challenged the pacesetter but was no match and retreated.
