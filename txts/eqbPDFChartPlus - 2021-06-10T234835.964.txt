 pressured pace, drew clear leaving the turn, led past the sixteenth pole and was outfinished in a game effort. JERRYS WAY lagged early while racing
 inside, finished well and gained late. JADEY AT THE BAR broke sharply, was never far off the pace, raced outside, went eight wide at the top of the stretch
 and offered a mild bid only. UNBRIDLED STORMY trailed the field, angled out , went widest in the drive, finished well and was gaining late. FICETY LADY
 broke awkwardly, raced outside and lacked the needed rally. DAT CAT MIRACLE raced close to the pace, bid inside to loom a threat and stopped.

 COASTLINE SERMON dueled early then pressed the issue inside, regained the advantage nearing the eighth pole and drew away. TOP HAT TITAN set a
 pressured pace and was no match in the drive while holding the place. JACKS OUTLAW chased the top pair and was gaining late on the runner-up.
 MCENTIRE came out at the start then bumped and steadied in tight early then lacked a rally. TOP OF THE ROCK forwardly placed outside, raced in the
 five path into the stretch and tired. THE METAL MAN broke outward then came in bumping and tightening up a rival and checked soon after the start, raced
 just off the rail on the turn and weakened. HAVE A LIL PEPPER was bumped at the start then had no bid.
