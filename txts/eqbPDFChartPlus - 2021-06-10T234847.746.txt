 Footnotes
 BUST ANOTHER pressed the pace three wide, challenged outside PRIVATE PARTY into the stretch, gained the upper hand entering the last furlong and
 proved narrowly best. PRIVATE PARTY set the pace inside, dug in when confronted by BUST ANOTHER, yielded command near the eighth-pole but kept
 on stubbornly. KING KRANZ pressed the pace between horses, and weakened around the turn. VASTJESUS trailed well back every step of the way.

 PERDIDO BAY sprinted clear early, set an easy pace to the stretch and widened under hand urging. PURRS AGAIN chased toward the inside from the
 start, could not go with the top one turning for home, but ran on for the place. TALKS IN HER SLEEP raced three wide around the turn, and rallied mildly
 outside. RADCLIFFE ROYALE chased two wide early, moved inside for the drive and lacked a bid. LAMBANO chased three wide to the top of the lane, and
 tired. REDNECK LADY became unsettled unseating the rider prior to loading, raced wide and was never close. WHY WOULDN'T WE broke slowly, and was
 finished early two wide. STERLING INDIA steadied slightly at the back early, and continued to trail.

 BEST SECRETS KEPT dashed clear and moved inside after the start, rated along slightly off the rail to the top of the stretch, remained well in command
 and was geared down through the late stages. ALONG CAME BETTY settled in the middle of the field three wide to the stretch, and rallied to go clear of the
 others. SHATTER ME was difficult to load, chased two wide, lugged in turning for home and continued evenly. EMO bobbled and steadied after the start,
 chased after the eventual winner to the stretch, and gave way. BE BOP A LOLA saved ground to no avail. SUSI SOLE shifted out four wide nearing the

 NO SNIVELING vied for command inside PRIDE LEADER for six furlongs, edged away through upper stretch, and remained clear under pressure. PRIDE
 LEADER dueled for command outside NO SNIVELING to the top of the stretch, got shaken off but held for the place. SWEET SANIBEL saved ground early,
 went along in midpack through the middle stages, and rallied mildly inside for a share. FIERY FLOWER had the rail early, moved out four wide gaining
 mildly around the far turn and into upper stretch, but flattened out. BEACHTREASUREGIRL bobbled after the start and was slow into stride, shifted out
 three then four wide on the far turn, lugged in through the stretch and finished evenly. SUMMER VOW sat just off the dueling leaders, but came up empty
 three wide into the lane. QUEEN LEIA was forwardly placed inside for a half-mile, and gave way. PROSPECTIVE MELODY raced two wide on the turns,
 moved out into the stretch and dropped far back.

 LAWN DART sprinted to the front early, showed the way in the two-path to the stretch, and remained clear under a drive. LITTLE CAT GEE was slow into
 stride, shifted out to the four-path coming off the turn, and rallied outside to get up for second late. PRINCESS NEKIA raced three wide on the turn, and
 finished evenly. ANGEL BY THE SEA gave chase three wide after the leader, and faded through the late stages. LORDEN'S LOVE chased between horses
 into the turn, and lacked a solid response nearing the stretch. ABSENCEISPRESENCE chased inside and tired after a half-mile. STERLING QUEEN was
 never a factor toward the inside.

 IONIC quickly secured command, rated along inside through dawdling early fractions, and kicked away when roused in the stretch. GARDENISTA settled in
 midpack two wide early, moved out to the four-path coming off the far turn with a mild rally, and saved the place. BLUE ATLAS saved ground early, swung
 four wide leaving the far turn and finished willingly. ALEXA ROSE broke outward, found a good spot tucked in just off the first flight, continued along saving
 ground to the stretch, and lacked the needed bid. PURRAGEOUS DYNA chased outside IONIC for six furlongs, and faded steadily. REMARKABLE SOUL
 raced inside early, and could not gain three wide around the far turn. GOLDEN ORB chased three wide for six furlongs, and gave way. TRUE YANKEE was
 forced out at the start, trailed widest into the backstretch, moved inside and remained outrun. SWEET SANDY raced two wide, felt the whip up the
 backstretch and offered no response.

 RACE ME HOME (IRE) stalked outside ALL OUT OF ACES to the far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths and drew away handily. ALL OUT OF ACES
 set the pace inside, was powerless to hold off RACE ME HOME approaching the stretch, and ran on to hold second. THE GREAT CASBY raced three wide
 early, stayed in range two wide for six furlongs, and lacked a late bid. INDIAN GULCH was four wide around the first turn, stayed in range three wide into
 the far turn, but lost ground after six furlongs. MAJOR ATTITUDE saved ground to the far turn, swung three wide nearing the stretch, and made no
 appreciable headway. MARENGO ROAD was outrun two wide. CLEARLY SUPER was finished early inside.
