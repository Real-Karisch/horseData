 Footnotes
 BUSS THE BELL just off the inside early on, tipped out to the three path five furlongs from home as the leader WUSHU WARRIOR crossed inside to the two
 path, advanced through the turn just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs out to issue a challenge for the front nearing the quarter pole, took
 over command narrowly spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive inching away to the eighth pole, came under late threat and dug in to hold
 safe to prevail on the wire. FLIPPED inside early on, angled out to the three then four path five furlongs from home, came under coaxing three wide at the
 three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the finish latching on the aforementioned
 foe as that one hit the line. WUSHU WARRIOR established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide down the backstretch, tucked inside
 half a mile from home, came under increasing pressure from BUSS THE BELL to the outside through the latter portion of the turn, cut the corner headed for
 command, got shaken off nearing the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while preserving the show honors at the end. HOKULEA five wide down
 the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home placed to coaxing, chased through the turn just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no
 response. WELL IN TUNE reluctant to load prior to the start, broke a beat slow and chased greenly along the inside, floated briefly four wide midway down
 the backstretch growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path into the turn, continued just off the inside for home and made no impact.
 TRINNI JUICE bobbled slightly at the start, chased four then three wide down the backstretch until tucked inside put to coaxing half a mile from home, spun
 three wide into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 TIZZELLE away without incident springing from the starting gate, appeared unsettled for a few strides afterwards, arrived at the end of the homestretch
 going about much more professionally, took up position two wide in midpack, sat reserved to the conclusion of the backstretch, quickened prior to tipping
 into path three coming up to the five-sixteenths pole in preparation for the stretch run, was put to a hard drive spinning into the lane, out-raced the runner up
 for the lead during the ensuing furlong and kicked away. ICESPIRE (GB) attained a prominent position after the start, attended the pacesetter from the two
 path, well rated, crept up to issue a challenge as three-quarters was being competed, was out-sprinted by the eventual winner for the top, continued onward
 in a willing manner securing second. JAUNT kept an eye on the front runnners from the pocket, pilot aboard with a snug grip on the reins for the majority of
 the journey to the three-eighrths pole, continue to remain on hold to the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, got angled three wide at the eighth
 pole, mustered up a mild kick to be along for the show. UNTAKEN unhurried while two wide during the opening phases, tucked along the inside approaching
 the top of the far turn, was set to strong encouragement swinging out three wide for the drive home, came up empty. HOUSE OF DIXIE broke sharply, was
 quick to rail with the lead, cut the pace. well rated and being tailed by the second place finisher, came under attack from the top twosome as six furlongs
 was being reached, gave in and backed away. STAY FOND saved ground to the quarter pole, got spotted three wide at the head of the stretch, had no
 offering.

 UNI (GB) settled inside through the first turn just off the pace before taking up position behind the cover of the leader three wide down the backstretch,
 remained patiently handled tucking just off the inside keeping the cover behind the leader through the far turn, swung out three wide into upper stretch into
 the clear, came under urging three-sixteenths from home, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole and inched away under a drive kept to task
 establishing a course record. FIFTY FIVE just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside seven-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing near the
 five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, angled to the inside straightened away for home and rallied with good energy inside a pair a
 sixteenth out and secured the place honors in the final jumps. STALLION HEIRESS bumped lightly at the start by NOT TAKEN who broke in a step,
 established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through the opening bend before settling into a comfortable rhythm in the three path
 down the backstretch showing the way through sensible splits safely in front, tucked to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing five-sixteenths
 from home as her rivals began to get busy in behind, spun just off the inside for home, dug in coming under threat from flanking challengers latched on a
 furlong out, got headed just inside the eighth pole, battled on between foes until the very late stages and was just bested for the place honors while clear for
 the show. MY IMPRESSION just off the inside through the first turn, settled four then three wide down the backstretch behind the cover of NOT TAKEN,
 came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide at the quarter pole, offered no response. NOT TAKEN a bit fractious in the gate prior to the

 settling four then three wide in closest range of that rival down the backstretch, chased three wide through the far turn put to encouragement with
 five-sixteenths to run, swung four wide into upper stretch backing away and weakened in the drive.

 Footnotes
 ROCK DOC cut over to the rail while in joint possession of the advantage with GORELLI, saw H MAN join the pace fracas as the first fration was being
 finalized, was hounded by them during the setitng of the next split, even with the tempo having picked up by several notches, got let loose for the drive
 home, appeared to be in possession of its largest lead coming up to the eighth pole, needed to exert gameness to the end, what with a slight resurgence
 coming from H MAN late in addition to a pair of fresher late closers, and did just that to post the score. THE CARETAKER sat pocketed tracking a three-way
 tussle for command, was asked for more spinning four wide into the stretch, closed in belated but got staved off. ALTESINO pursued the front runners from
 the three path on the turn, was ridden vigorously getting angled out into path seven, becoming the widest of all, into upper stretch, straightened away, came
 home with good energy, but fell short. H MAN put to stout hold early, ranged up to latch on the front runners as the initial fraction was in the process of being
 posted, vied as the widest of three all during the run around the bend, fell back a bit during the going from upper to midlane, flashed some life late holding its
 ground well enough to salvage the last major check. PROPHET'S CAT three wide entering the turn, was driven six wide towards the eighth pole, was part of
 the blanket finish, but without having made any impact. FORMAL START in the two path and between rivals for much of the way to the end of the bend, had
 no rally. GORELLI shifted into path two shortly after the field had been sent on its way, disputed the pace from between rivals from the four and half unitl
 midstretch before backing away.

 Footnotes
 BATTLE OF BLENHEIM tracked the pace from the two path, tucked inside seven-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, spun just
 off the inside for home, offered up a good finish to close outside latching on nearing the sixteenth pole, poked a head in front seventy yards from home and
 inched away to the finish establishing a course record. ATTRIBUTE came in slightly after the start bumping ACCOUNTABLE into MR. DOUGIE FRESH,
 raced two to three wide through the first turn, settled in hand just off the inside down the backstretch showing the way safely in front, got given some rein
 and slipped away midway on the far turn, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under growing threat to the outside through the final furlong, got
 collared seventy yards from home while well clear of the rest for the place honors. MR. DOUGIE FRESH bumped after the start by ACCOUNTABLE due to
 pressure from ATTRIBUTE, raced three to four wide through the first turn before settling three wide in closest aim of the front, came under coaxing nearing
 the five-sixteenths, continued three wide at the head of the stretch, weakened in the drive. KULIN ROCK settled just off the inside near the rear, tucked
 inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered no response. ACCOUNTABLE got
 bumped after the start by ATTRIBUTE who came in slightly and in turn bumped MR. DOUGIE FRESH, settled two to three wide at the tail of the field,
 tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact. CALIFORNIA SWING three then two wide in pursuit, came
 under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, got put to a protective hold and was eased through the final furlong, then got pulled
 up and subsequently vanned off after the finish.

 Footnotes
 MISS MUNNINGS secured a spot along the inside route after the break, sat loosely pocketed keeping watch on the front runners during the initial stages,
 picked up interest angling to the outside after three-quarters had beencompleted, was in path two under a drive spinning into the lane, shoe-horned itself
 into a seam between rivals in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, emerged with the lead at the eighth pole, albeit barely, was forced to fend off two
 rivals to the outside the rest of way home and was tenacious enough to do just that. COEXISTENCE raced three wide on both turns, picked up speed
 getting roused coming into the stretch, clawed its way into a practical dead heat with the top one by the beginning of the final furlong, vied with determination
 from between rivals from that juncture onward but was denied by a gallant MISS MUNNINGS. SOAR FROM SHADOWS strung out three wide in midpack,
 sprang to life swinging four wide into the stretch, fought hard outside the top twosome during the last eighth, had good energy, but was held off. HIGHLAND
 LADY brushed with RUBELLITE midway along the chute, went on to attain a forward position, prompted the pacesetter taking the two path, kept at the task
 for over six furlongs and gave way. RUBELLITE got pinched shortly after the start, made it onto the main course and took up residence two wide in midpack,
 continued to stalk TWOFER from there to the end of the second bend, tipped slighty wider for the drive home, lacked the needed response. KINGDOM'S
 QUEEN sat reserved from the two path, got sent out four wide into the stretch, made no impact. CONFIRMATION BIAS slipped to the outside midpoont on
 the backstretch, got put to encouragement spinning three wide into the lane, had no gain. TWOFER showed the way from the inside, at first being well
 rated, came under heavy pressure for the drive home and gave in. CATENARIA made contact with RUBELLITE before departing the chute, underwent a
 three wide trip to the quarter pole, failed to make it presence felt.

 Footnotes
 SIR BALLANTINE five then four wide in pursuit down the backstretch from mid pack, tucked three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the
 three-eighths, went five then four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final eighth seizing command seventy yards from home
 before inching away late on to prevail. EXULTING four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced from the nine-sixteenths tucking to the two
 path and prompted the leader through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, took narrow command spinning just off the inside for home, tussled
 with the former leader until shaking that rival off just inside the eighth pole now confronted by the aforementioned foe, dug in getting collared seventy yards
 from home while clear for the place honors. EKHTIBAAR bumped at the start by VINCENTO who broke out a step, chased three then two wide under
 coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. MR. BUFF established the front shortly
 after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under pressure from the nine-sixteenths and dueled inside of EXULTING through the turn
 coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner headed for command, continued to fight on inside to just inside the eighth pole, then
 weakened in the late stages. STORM PROPHET chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths
 from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. CLUTCH CARGO chased three then two wide from near the rear under a ride
 from three furlongs out, cornered three wide into upper stretch, made no impact. VINCENTO broke out at the start bumping with EKHTIBAAR, chased two
 to three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wie into upper stretch and trailed
 throughout.

 Footnotes
 BLACK STETSON got sent over to the rail with the lead affer the start, showed the way on the turn being pressed by a pair of opponents parked out in paths
 two and three respectively, began to inch away coming up to the quarter pole, settled into upper stretch and was called upon for more, padded the margin
 so as to commence the final furlong holding its largest lead, saw the runner up whittle away with well under a sixteenth to go, yet remained safely in the
 clear. NOOTKA SOUND remained forwardly placed after the start, forced the isuse as the widest of three from path three from the crown of the bend to its
 end, shifted more into path four stepping into the lane, gained well in the final seventy yards but couldn't get there in time. COLTANDMISSISSIPPI pursued
 the ontgong pace disptue three wide on the turn, got angled out five to six wide coming into upper stretch, straightened away and rallied for the show.
 AMBASSADOR JIM was quickly placed along the inside route, saved ground for nearly a half, moved to the outside for the stretch run until towards path six,
 mustered up a mild response good enough to claim the final significant slice of the pot. ALL SYSTEMS GO lost his footing shying away from its next door
 neighbor right after the field had been sent off and running, got set up on the rail, cut the corner under a full drive, closed in but without making its presence
 felt. SMOOTH B got guided into path two afer the start, disputed the pace from between foes on the turn, hand urged, swung into the lane and remained a
 prominent factor for another furlong before weakening. BARBAROSSA had the pilot take hold after breakking a bit to the outside, took up position along the
 rail, tipped to the outside after completing the half, failed to fire, then was reported after the race to have bled.

 Footnotes

 coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch roused for the stretch drive, angled out to the four path nearing the eighth pole closing with a
 rush outside to issue a challenge and take command a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish going away at the end. TOO COOL TO DANCE
 two to three wide in closest range of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths applying pressure to that rival, spun just off the inside for home,
 rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in and was collared a sixteenth from home by his barnmate, then ran on to secure the place honors.

 late and procure the show honors. AMAZING AUDREY two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along three furlongs out, swung three wide
 into upper stretch, kept on through the drive to improve position for the last major share. JASMINE'S GEM tracked the pace along the inside, came under a
 ride three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SANSIBAR JEWEL established the front and showed
 the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing under challenge at the three-eighths, cut the corner roused into upper stretch under threat, dug in and
 yielded nearing the eighth pole, weakened in the final furlong. HOT CASH two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along at the
 three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. MIGHTY FINE broke awkward getting away half a beat slow, raced three wide
