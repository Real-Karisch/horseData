 EMBLAZE raced well off the rail and was three to four wide the entire race but proved best. RITZYRAGS was caught in a three horse speed duel one out
 from the rail and was clearly second best. BRIDGE TO THE MOON showed good speed on the inside in a three horse duel and tired. NORTHERN ROCK
 raced in the two path much of the race and made a mild bid in the stretch. NINESAREWILD showed good speed three wide throughout but was through at
 teh top of the stretch. MEANINGLESS BANTER had a rail trip and had nothing to offer in the sretch.
