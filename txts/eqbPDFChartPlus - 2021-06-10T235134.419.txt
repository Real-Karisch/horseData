 Footnotes
 HEART AND PRAY attended the pace off of the inside, got through entering the stretch, took over nearing the furlong marker and drew away. RADAR
 VISION dropped far back in the opening quarter mile, took closer order leaving the turn, advanced through traffic and angled out for the final furlong, kicked
 on well but was left with too much to do. PERFECT BEAUTY stalked the pace, came three wide to make her bid, but flattened and settled for the minor
 award. IDONTCAREWHATUSAY sprinted clear to set the pace along the inside, drifted out a bit entering the stretch, was collared between horses and gave
 way readily. SHOTOGOODJUDGEMENT settled saving ground, moved up along the inside, angled out to make a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive.
 CAROLINA REAPER was allowed to settle, circled into the stretch seven wide, but failed to make headway. SCREAMIN DIXIE was allowed to settle, tucked
 in to save ground, but lacked a response when called upon. NAUGHTY NINJA was hustled along five wide, but came up empty leaving the turn and
 retreated. PENNYANN'S INN was through after a half.

 sustain the drive. PASS SET HIT sped clear and angled in to set the pace, was headed leaving the second turn, disputed the issue to the furlong marker

 MYKONOS stalked the pace three deep, moved up to engage the leader entering the stretch, wore down that one and edged clear late. BUD'S BAYONET
 set the pressured pace along the inside, fought on through a prolonged drive but was unable to resist the winner. BIRDS GONE WILD stumbled badly at the
 start, was unhurried into stride, angled out and finished willingly to earn the show. JEN'S SONG attended the pace along the inside, got through but lacked
 the needed late response. ARATHORN was allowed to settle, came four wide but went evenly. STARSHIP MERCURY was allowed to settle, came five wide
 but failed to respond. MUNTIJ showed little. AMBIDEXTROUS ALEX disputed the pace two wide for a half and dropped out.

 Footnotes
 BIG RALPH settled in hand, looped up five wide on the second turn, forged command leaving the second turn, edged clear and dug in to prevail.
 SLOWHAND tracked four wide, dropped off the leaders leaving the second turn in traffic, shifted out and came again once clear. NIGHT GALLERY set the
 pressured pace three wide, fought on gamely but grudgingly gave in. ROYAL GHOST was allowed to settle four wide, advanced between horses, angled
 out near the furlong marker and improved position. BLITZKRIEGER was close up four wide to the stretch and weakened. OAKENSHIELD was forwardly
 placed along the inside to the stretch and tired. SCHILLER SOUND contended off of the inside for six furlongs and faded. OOPS I AM failed to respond.
 COPPER MUNN showed little. MIXMAKER was through early.

 Footnotes
 HEAVENLY HILL was back early on, swung into the six path in the turn, rallied down the lane and drove clear in the final stages. SOCATA vied early on,
 angled off the rail in the turn, drew clear in the stretch but yielded late in the drive. ETHYL ETHER broke out at the start, stalked the pace early, shifted into
 the four path in the turn and flattened out late in the stretch run. STREET LOVE pressed the pace early, shifted into the three path in the turn and weakened
 late in the stretch drive. BEL CANTO hopped at the start and raced back early, fanned into the five path in the turn and moved up in the stretch. CARLIE Q
 fanned into the seven path in the turn and was empty down the lane. WAVE DANCER was through after a half. SCHEMA pressed the pace early, shifted
 into the four path in the turn and faded late in the stretch. FAITH IN CATHY was never a threat. ANOTHER GAL had brief speed from between horses then
 folded up. TAGLIA was done early.
