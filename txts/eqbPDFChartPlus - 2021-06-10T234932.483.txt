 edged away late. COURT NOTE, two wide in second flight, drifted out through stretch and had no late gain. MONACO set the pace in the four path, loomed
 to deep stretch and then weakened. BEN OF THE BRIDGE, in the three path while unhurried, drifted out and tired. FERDINANDTHEMOUSE, wide, failed to
 menace. ATAWAY MAX, between foes, never threatened. SIGHT LINE, just off the rail in second flight, stopped suddenly after a half mile, was pulled up in
 distress and walked off.

 POP KEENAN bobbled slightly and hit the right side of the starting gate, raced just off the rail, eased out on the turn, split rivals rallying through stretch and
 was along in time. GRAVES ISLAND drifted out after start, saved ground to early stretch, angled out near mid stretch and regained place. TRUE
 BOLDNESS, fanned in after the start, raced wide while just off pace, lacked a strong a strong closing kick but finished determinedly to regain the show spot.
 MOE TROUBLE was angled in leaving the gate causing crowding, set the pace three path, shook loose to be clear with a furlong to run, was not persevered
 with through the final yards and was nailed for the show spot. LATE BREAKING NEWS, in tight after the start, raced in the three path while just off pace,
 drifted out through stretch and faded. YEAH ROCKY was also in tight after the start and was steered wide, remained wide and tired QUICK LEARNER failed
 to menace. POISED FOR ACTION showed little.

 Footnotes
 EDEN GOT EVEN rallied to challenge for the lead in midstretch and drove clear. MICHAZL JOHN rallied between horses to loom boldly with a furlong to run
 but was not good enough. INSIDER was void of early speed then was going well at the end to gain third. ART BIJOU (ARG) was outrun early then rallied
 mildly. FAIRLY BOLD was bumped at the start then continued willingly. SUNSHINE LOVE rallied mildly. CITY COUNT lacked a solid closing response.
 SKIPPER DANCER bobbled at the start then chased and tired. COOL FUSE moved up menacingly leaving turn then weakened. OUR GEORGIO broke
 sharp to show the way then had little left. SHIMERVILLE pressed the pace then tired. SARATOGA TOMMY showed little.
