 Z J WINS raced three wide early, then stalked two wide, advanced on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, dug in gamely outside of GENERAL
 MACARTHUR in a long stretch drive and wore down that rival late to prevail. GENERAL MACARTHUR was bumped at the start, set the pace on the inside,
 dueled with Z J WINS turning for home, dug in gamely inside through the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. LITTLE LEO raced off the pace inside, saved
 ground on the far turn and rallied mildly inside for third. THE WAYNE FACTOR raced four wide early, then two wide, moved up between rivals on the far
 turn, then lacked a rally. SKIPPER DANCER was bumped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, went three wide on the far turn and tired. IN R
 DEFENCE was bumped at the start, pulled and steadied on the first turn, then tracked inside and faded. SKY CITY raced three wide early, continued off the

 FIVES WILD tracked close up inside, angled out in upper stretch, rallied between rivals, surged late and was up in time. BUNSTER set the pace on the
 inside, responded when asked, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong and yielded near the finish. DRILLIANT was bumped at the start and steadied, raced
 off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, rallied mildly on the rail and was up late for third. QUALITY STEP was bumped at the start, pulled in the early
 stages, settled two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. ENGLISH LAUGHTER
 stalked two wide, chased the leaders on the far turn and lacked a rally. MALIO'S raced off the pace inside and did not factor. MR CHOCOLATE CHIP had a
 three wide trip racing off the pace and failed to threaten.
