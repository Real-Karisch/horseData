 Footnotes
 CROWDED WAY broke out and bumped at the start, dueled for the lead from the outside, cleared inside rival on the turn and drew off through the final
 furlong. BUTTERFLY FAITH veered in and bumped rival leaving the gate, asked early and chased the top pair, took the turn two to three wide, lacked the
 needed late kick and finished a clear second. SAY YOUR GRACE bumped leaving the gate, showed no early speed, raced two wide then angled out,
 summoned a mild rally and got up for the show. ALLAN'S BABY dueled from the inside early, lost contact with the winner around the turn and faded in the
 stretch. LADY SIF tracked the pace while outside a rival, raced three wide around the turn and never rallied. ALONDRA raced off the rail and outside a rival,
 exited the turn four to five wide and couldn't respond to urging. E Z MISS bumped hard by outside rival at the start, traveled along the inside, came out a bit
 in the stretch and also never responded when asked. AMERICAS GAL settled along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and came up empty in the final
 furlong.

 SNOWMASS VILLAGE set the pace down the backstretch, continued clear from the two path through the turn, contended with VOLUNTARY past the
 sixteenth pole and was able to prevail under right-handed urging. VOLUNTARY broke well and dropped back a bit to stalk the pace, raced two wide then
 three wide into the lane, rallied late but could not pass the winner. ANTINANCO broke out and bumped leaving the gate, raced along the inside, drifted out
 on the turn, showed late effort and earned the show. RAINSFORD bumped at the start, chased from along the inside and finished evenly in the late stages.
 WEST A WHILE traveled three deep into the turn, floated out by rival around the bend and couldn't rally. KOE FACTS knocked into rival leaving the gate,
 raced between foes to the turn, moved over to the rail around the bend and faded in the lane.
