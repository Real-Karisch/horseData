 Footnotes
 SHE'S NO JOKE broke with top flight then edged back to rate off the early pace, let out a notch and began to take closer order near half mile marker,
 commenced steady bid in far turn and put to drive two wide turning for home, challenged when UNRIVALED SOUL advanced along rail entering top stretch,
 dueled for lead under firm handling and edged away late. UNRIVALED SOUL was rated along rail through backstretch run then switched out path and
 patiently ridden midway through far turn, took advantage of rail spot opening up late turn and sent through, challenged SHE'S NO JOKE for lead, dueled
 along inside through the lane then lacked closing kick. CASUAL CARO broke well then raced in stalking position off top two leaders, hustled up in far turn
 then set down for the drive racing four wide and continued steady effort to best the rest. MOMMA TRIES raced in the back and widest through backstretch,
 came under a ride along outside in the turn then improved position without threatening. TRINI PLEASURE roused forward out of the chute to apply pace
 pressure to PADDYS CLASS, continued to force the issue into turn then lost position and had nothing left in the lane. PADDYS CLASS set a pressured
 pace then started getting out in far turn, continued to drift wide losing ground into upper stretch then drifted erratically to outside fence while trying to be
 pulled up, pulled up after wire and walked off. LU LU BELLE showed brief interest then retreated and easing up going by the wire. STEWARDS POSTED

 Footnotes
 BLUES SONGS saved ground in range early, stumbled going by the three-eighths pole, came three wide into the lane, lugged in through upper stretch,
 altered course back outside and surged to overhaul MUCH ABOUT IT at the wire. MUCH ABOUT IT was caught wide outside LADY PARADISE midway on
 the first turn, took over to the backstretch and rated along through an easy pace inside, shook off a bid from ITS ABOUT ME in upper stretch, was clear late
 but could not hang on. LADY PARADISE led into the first turn despite being hard to handle getting out three wide, moved inside and checked relinquishing
 command to MUCH ABOUT IT entering the backstretch and losing position, saved ground the rest of the way and ran on with good courage to get the show.
 BLESS THE RAINS came in bumping ITS ABOUT ME at the start and was steadied being pulled off that rival, saved ground taking closer order through the
 middle fractions, shifted off the fence and lacked room behind horses through the furlong grounds, and finished well after getting clear. ITS ABOUT ME got
 bumped by BLESS THE RAINS at the start, became very rank three to four wide through the opening half-mile, challenged outside MUCH ABOUT IT past
 the quarter-pole, and flattened out in midstretch. SMIRKOTCH raced four wide throughout, advanced under a heavy drive late on the far turn, and gave way
 a furlong out. BETTER VIBES raced in the second flight from the outset, took the far turn in the four-path and could not reach contention. RATE OF
 RETURN prompted the pace outside MUCH ABOUT IT and gave way after six furlongs. YES ITS FACTUAL checked outside BLUES SONGS approaching
 the far turn, dropped back and did not recover.

 Footnotes
 GRAN MALBEC quick kick to lead at the start, continued to set the pace near inside and held firm still unleashed through the turn, set down for the drive
 and fended off CAPTAIN GAUGHEN under firm handling. CAPTAIN GAUGHEN broke on top then raced in tracking position, kept on two to three wide
 through the turn then driving along outside in the stretch and produced solid finish. MORNING BUZZ was forwardly placed racing off the early leader,
 continued in pursuit through the lane but lacked late needed kick. BUSHROD dropped to inside leaving the backstretch and raced in tight along rail past the
 quarter pole then put to drive racing just off inside, raced in contention then evened out. DON'T BE SO SALTY away last at the start then switched off inside
 and loomed up closer along outside mid-turn, fanned out entering top stretch then flattened out in the lane. MOONWALKER hustled up three wide through
 the turn then five wide upper stretch but failed to kick on. ROYAL RANSOM raced under steady urging along inside without gaining threatening position.

 Footnotes
 CORDELE broke a step slow, advanced inside to be in range of the first flight after a quarter-mile, waited for clearance into the turn behind STORM
 TEMPLE PILOT, got through as the latter vacated the rail a quarter-mile out, came off the inside rallying in deep stretch and reeled in FALLEN LEAF to
 edge clear. ANSWER MY CALL angled inside soon after the start, saved ground outsprinted to the lane, shifted to the three-path and finished well to get
 FALLEN LEAF for the runner-up spot near the finish. FALLEN LEAF shot to the front after the start, showed the way inside to the stretch, was clear a
 sixteenth out but could not hold off the winner and yielded the place in the last strides. SAMMIE SUNSHINE broke outward and trailed into the turn two
 wide, cut the corner into the stretch, steered out widest past the furlong marker and gained belatedly. AWSUM ROAR pressed the pace two wide between
 horses, and gave up the chase entering the last furlong. STORM TEMPLE PILOT saved ground to late on the turn, swung three wide looking dangerous at
 the top of the lane, but could not sustain the bid. MO TOWN KAT was no factor three wide. AWESOMENDENSOME raced two wide outrun to the stretch,
 and was forced out by SAMMIE SUNSHINE while not making headway past the eighth-pole. DELICIOUS PURSUIT broke outward, pressed the pace three
 wide for almost three furlongs, and faltered before reaching the stretch.

 Footnotes
 BARRIER ISLAND raced two wide in the first turn then moved up to challenge for early lead, dueled through the backstretch and continued to battle in far
 turn, dug in gamely near three sixteenths pole, turned back bids and remained sharp. SARACOSA stalked through the backstretch then hustled up three
 wide approaching quarter pole, began edging up near equal terms turning for home then drifted in couple paths upper stretch, raced in striking distance of
 BARRIER ISLAND but could not get to rival while securing place. DROP DEAD RED was forwardly positioned racing under snug hold then dueled outside
 path of BARRIER ISLAND with SARACOSA looming up late turn, could not match strides with eventual winner top stretch then steadied losing momentum
 when SARACOSA drifted in and weakened to show. DENVER was unhurried racing along outside through backstretch run, made a move along outside
 through final turn, raced wide into stretch then came in few paths and lacked needed response for impact. NAUTIA raced in the back, saved ground into
 stretch, under steady inside urging to no avail. PAULETTE sped to the lead and secured inside position in first turn, quickly came under pressure and
 dueled for the lead through the backstretch, could not move on with top pair entering far turn then retreated.

 Footnotes
 MR. EDGAR bounded clear at once, rated along inside through an easy pace, was roused giving DECIDER the slip in upper stretch and widened under a
 mild drive. DECIDER bounced off the left side of the gate at the start, ran along as the only one within hailing distance of MR. EDGAR around the turn, had
 aim outside to the lane but was no match, and held well enough for second. CLAMOR lost his footing badly for several strides and had to be gathered up
 just after the start, raced three wide and was never a factor. STEADILY was put to the whip out of the gate, but was outrun two wide. UNYIELDING became
 erratic and was taken up past the half-mile pole, and dropped far back.

 ABYSSINIAN quickly cleared on top and angled to inside, continued to hold firm still unleashed going through the turn, extended margin on top upper
 stretch under strong hand ride, shown the whip and tapped couple times to sharp victory. CHARMAINE'S MIA broke out at the start the raced in tracking
 position, prompted to lodge a bid racing two wide at quarter pole then kept along in steady pursuit for second best. CREEDIBILITY raced in the last flight
 under steady encouragement, bid three wide through turn then five wide in stretch, dug in and got up late for show. NILESTAR chased the pace along
 inside, continued in close range through the turn, no match for pulling away winner but continued steady bid then evened out and lost share. DEVIOUS
 CHARM broke for the lead then weakened out of flight, hustled up through the turn then three wide top stretch, angled to inside then switched back out
 couple paths, showed interest but needed more for impact. CASPIAN JEWEL bumped at the start, raced in last flight then two wide through turn and failed
 to kick on in lane. KATIELEIGH forwardly positioned just off early leader through the turn then weakened in the lane.

 Footnotes
 MR CHAPLIN followed behind STORMING MY WAY covered up in the two-path, switched out being put to heavy left-hand pressure turning for home, and
 finished with good determination to get up late. STORMING MY WAY bumped lightly with SANFILIPO at the start, rated along in the two-path, edged away
 from BENEFICIARY at the top of the stretch, remained clear to 70 yards out but failed to last. KING WILDCAT went along at the rear though not terribly far
 back three wide, rallied mildly outside the top two and was clearly best of the others. ECLIPSED MOON saved ground advancing after a half-mile, stayed on
 the rail around the turn and into the stretch, and lacked the needed final response. ONE FINE RIDE raced in striking range four then five wide around the
 turn, and faded in the stretch. SANFILIPO bumped lightly with STORMING MY WAY at the start, tracked three to four wide for six furlongs, and was empty
 under pressure near the eighth-pole. BENEFICIARY pressed the pace outside STORMING MY WAY, could not maintain position under a drive late on the
 turn and dropped back between horses.

 UNA LUNA brushed at the start then secured inside position in first turn, settled nicely being rated inside not far off frontend, patiently ridden and inched way
 up closer late turn then two wide turning for home, given cue upper stretch, responded and drove by REAGAN'S ODYSSEY to take control and held on
 under steady encouargement. TRILBY was allowed to settle out of the gate and dropped to inside, continued unhurried saving ground through the
 backstretch, patiently ridden in final turn then altered course for clear path upper stretch, kicked in and gaining to end. REAGAN'S ODYSSEY took
 command at the start and led the way into backstretch, continued to hold firm along inside through far turn, roused for more top stretch but could not
 maintain the advantage past the furlong marker. DYNATOWN brushed at the start, raced in range through backstretch, hustled up two wide in final turn then
 came out wide entering top stretch and improved position without threatening. HERA raced in tracking position through the backstretch, asked to quicken
 mid-way through final turn then came up tired upper stretch. BIENVILLE STREET stalked the pace through the backstretch, continued strong contender

 RAZORBACK LADY hooked up in a duel outside AWESOME MASS shortly after the start, put that rival away near the quarter-pole and shifted inside
 edging away through upper stretch, and remained clear under a drive. QUICK QUICK QUICK had aim off the battling leaders three wide late on the turn,
 rallied into second with a clear shot at RAZORBACK LADY into upper stretch, made no further headway and was able to save the place. COACH ROCKS
 raced three then four wide being scrubbed on past the midway point of the turn, was under a full drive a quarter-mile out, gained late outside on the wrong
 lead and just missed second while no threat to the winner. POSSE NEEDED saved ground to the turn, had the two-path into the stretch and ran on
 one-paced. AWESOME MASS contested the pace inside RAZORBACK LADY, and gave way after five furlongs on the rail. PIERETTE saved ground and
 was outrun throughout.
