 Footnotes
 BENDI BLU was asked early between foes for some early speed, responded by tracking the early pace three wide through the opening bend, continued
 three wide down the backstretch just off the lead then improved position taking over the lead nearing the three-eighths pole and drew off in the lane under
 mild encouragement with the right hand. DYNAMITE DAUGHTERS tracked just off the early pace on the inside, continued while forwardly placed nearest
 the rail down the backstretch then shifted out wide past the half mile pole, failed to match strides with BENDI BLUE and flattened out in the stretch. WOW
 WOW NOW was allowed to settle four wide in the early going, commenced a bid between foes nearing the three eighths pole, gained third position nearing
 the quarter pole but finished evenly through the lane and was no match for the top two. RHYTHM DANCER tracked on the rail through the opening half then
 switched out at the half and proved no factor late. SUNSET DREAMER settled well back in the early going and proved no factor. GLADEE'S GRAY LADY
 was off quickly pulled to the lead, led to the half mile pole then gave way past the quarter pole.

 Footnotes
 MESA SKYLINE was reserved four wide in the early going, continued to track well off the pace on the inside past the half mile then angled out five wide
 while commencing his bid nearing the quarter pole, shifted nearly seven wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and drove clear in the final sixteenth while
 under steady right handed pressure. UNION RICHES was allowed to settle between foes during the opening half, commenced a bid while angling out six
 wide at the top of the stretch and was outfinished by MESA SKYLINE but finished willingly to get up for second place. DREAMER'S POINT tracked just off
 the pace on the inside in the early portion of the race, shifted out nearing the quarter pole but lacked running room so angled back inside splitting foes
 nearing the furlong marker and finished willingly to get up for third. TIZ MEOW pressed the pace three wide in the early going, failed to match strides with
 COLE CAMP down the backstretch, shifted out at the top of the stretch but was outkicked by multiple foes in the lane. COLE CAMP was off well on the
 inside, assumed command from TIZ MEOW down the backstretch, led the field into the stretch but faltered in the final furlong. PHILO was allowed to settle
 on the outside and failed to menace. WILDSCORE tracked the pace three wide in the early going, commenced a bid in the same path nearing the quarter
 pole and faded in the lane. BEER SHERIFF was held up in close quarters shortly after the start, angled to the inside then was unhurried in the early going
 and proved no factor.

 Footnotes
 BOURQUE, urged to the fore while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to the far turn, widened into upper
 stretch and maintained a safe margin under firm handling. CHOCOLATEICECREAM tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight, then inside a rival
 into the far turn, continued with a steady late bid while failing to gain terms with the winner but proved best of the others. KID FROSTIE tracked off the
 second flight four wide racing into the backstretch, continued outside foes into the far turn and made an effort to improve position four deep between foes
 late. SKIPPY'S STRIKE, held up off the second flight along the inside racing to the first turn, was shuffled back avoiding DROP OF GOLDEN SUN racing
 into the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position to the end. ST.
 BIRETTA, forwardly placed three deep tracking the pacesetter to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid nearing the lane but proved empty in
 late stages. CANDY COVE tracked the leaders between foes off the second flight in the opening half, angled to the inside leaving the far turn while being
 prompted to advance but had no late kick. TERYN IT UP, off a step slowly, was reserved between foes in the last flight early, swung out six wide racing into
 the lane but made no real impression. BUYMEABOND settled outside foes racing to the backstretch but proved no threat. DROP OF GOLDEN SUN was a
 brief factor inside foes in the second flight but emptied out early. BROKEN KEY, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, angled out racing into the far
 turn but offered no rally.

 FOREIGN RUMOR was off well then dueled for the lead on the inside of CAPTAIN DRAKE through the opening half, continued to battle head and head with
 rival to the top of lane then dispatched that foe, dug in through the lane and held gamely in the final sixteenth to prevail on the wire. BLUE ECLIPSE was off
 well, tracked the early pace on the inside through the opening half, commenced a bid nearing the quarter pole while angling out three wide past the quarter
 pole, bumped DANCE AND ROMANCE when shifting out at the top of the lane then finished willingly under steady right handed pressure through the lane.
 SIOUX VALLEY stumbled at the start then settled reserved three wide in the early going, angled out four wide nearing the three sixteenths pole and rallied
 to edge foe for third. CAPTAIN DRAKE dueled for the lead on the outside, battled with FOREIGN RUMOR to the top of the stretch then failed to match
 strides and weakened in the lane. DANCE AND ROMANCE was forwardly placed on the inside just off the dueling pacesetters into the turn, angled out four
 wide nearing the quarter pole then was bumped by BLUE ECLIPSE and tired through the lane. PHANTOM THREEONINE broke well out of the gate then
 retreated to the rear of the field, shifted four wide at the top of the lane and failed to respond. CLARK AND ADDISON was slow into stride at the start,
 settled well back, shifted out at the top of the lane and proved no factor. BERACUDA HEART was off slow at the start and proved no threat.

 Footnotes
 LINE OF GRACE, forwardly placed along the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside rivals to track the pacesetter just out of striking distance outside
 a rival through the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep in tandem with a rival nearing upper stretch, moved to wrest command in that path
 leaving the furlong marker then went clear late under right handed pressure and strong handling. SMART RACHEL was hustled to gain the lead while
 angling to the rail racing to the first turn, held sway on a comfortable margin into upper stretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid but proved no match for that
 rival late. SEYNATAWNEE, pulling a bit in the opening stages, was prompted to gain a forward placing racing into the backstretch tracking just off the
 pacesetter a bit off the inside, was urged to bid between foes in tandem with the eventual winner racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick.
 STRING BIKINI angled to the inside early dropping off the second flight, saved ground throughout but lacked the needed late response. RECONCILING,
 reserved last in the opening half, angled out racing into upper stretch but never proved a serious threat. LUNA'S EMPIRE switched outside rivals racing to
 the backstretch tracking off the second flight, shifted in on the far turn and steadily faded.

 Footnotes
 LIEUTENANT POWELL angled to the inside early to track just off the first flight under light rating racing into the backstretch, continued in that path to the far
 turn saving ground, briefly awaited an opening racing into upper stretch, then shifted out nearing midstretch splitting foes three deep while making light
 contact with ROCKNROLL ROCKET but continued with a solid late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed pressure. FUDGE
 TOUGH broke sharply, was urged to the fore along the rail racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn into upper stretch,
 resisted grudgingly to late stages but couldn't contain the winner. ROCKNROLL ROCKET tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch,
 was prompted to advance three deep nearing upper stretch, was bumped nearing midstretch but continued with interest to prevail for a share while being
 just outkicked by the top pair. SPINSTER ROAD angled inwards racing to the first turn to prompt a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue
 into the far turn, then into upper stretch but yielded in late stages. HOMELAND MESSA, carried out by LISTEN TO ROSE racing into the first turn, angled to
 the inside nearing the backstretch to track off the second flight but steadily faded into upper stretch. LISTEN TO ROSE, off a bit slowly, drifted out racing
 into the first turn momentarily impeding HOMELAND MESSA, shifted out to race four wide off the second flight on the backstretch and soon retreated.
