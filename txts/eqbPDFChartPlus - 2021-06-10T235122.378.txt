 Footnotes
 UP THE ANTE in hand as the widest of three front runners heads apart for a good portion of the trip along the chute, emerged with the top by the crown of
 the backstretch, glided onto the inside route, showed the way, coaxed along, inched its way into path two stepping into the stretch, hand ridden but not
 vigorously so, began to edge away, went about the final furlong lightly ridden out remaining comfortably in the clear. PENALTY between foes early, stalked
 the winner from the two path well rated on the backstretch, continued to shadow that opponent during the run around the full bend, was more in path three
 entering the lane, having been put to encouragement, failed to dent into the margin, held on well though to procure the place. VEGAS KITTEN off the inside
 throughout, got away the tardiest, was slow to settle into stride, moved to the outside coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, raced four wide on the
 bend, was under a ride angling slightly wider into the stretch, altered course back into path four in midstretch, mustered up a mild response to claim the
 show. HOUSEER took up the chase towards path two in the early going, tipped out into path three after stepping onto the backstretch and was sill near
 there travelling on the turn, paused in hand idling behind foes as six furlongs was being reached, settled in at the head of the stretch and was given its cue,
 was reined to the left in deep stretch attempting to secure better racing room, cut over in front of ZAP DADDY during the process, leading that one's pilot to
 check the mount and thus take itself out of the remainder of the contest. THE QUEENS JULES was pulling hard on the left tracking the winner on the
 backstretch, came up empty when put to a drive for the drive home. ZAP DADDY abandoned the inside route for the two path midway on the backstretch,
 flashed a tad more speed when asked for a bit more at the five-sixteenths pole, alternated between the rail and path two travelling down the stretch, was
 forced to check hard getting impeded by HOUSEER with a few jumps to spare before the finish line. LUSITANO was pulling on the left sputtering five wide
 onto the backstretch, continued to be the widest of all racing towards the half mile pole, left that station from path four, was about as wide leaving the turn as
 having entered it, wasn't making any headway when taken in hand when in close proximity to a shifting VEGAS KITTEN in midlane, steadily backed away
 thereafter. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on HOUSEER in the stretch, that one was disqualified from fourth and placed sixth for having caused
 interference.

 Footnotes
 ISOTOPE prompted the leader three wide through swift splits coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch
 straightened away, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive kept to task. PROBLEM SOLVING chased just off the
 inside coaxed along from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick knocking heads with PRAY FOR
 BOURBON to the wire and just bested that rival at the finish. PRAY FOR BOURBON three then two wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths,
 spun three wide for home, offered up a mild bid to fight head to head with the aforementioned foe through the final furlong but was ultimately nosed for the
 place honors while safe for the show. LEAH'S DREAM coaxed from the start, established the front and showed the way in hand from the two path under
 some pressure from ISOTOPE to the outside through swift splits, continued just off the inside for home, received a tap or two to the off side straightened
 away while not fully extended, yielded the front a furlong from home, came under an off sided stick through the final sixteenth while weakening in the late
 stages. HEXAMETER four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no
 response. GYPSY JO four wide in pursuit in range of the leader, came under encouragement midway on the turn, went five then four wide at the head of the
 stretch and tired. FRAU BLUCHER broke a beat slow, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered six wide into upper stretch,
 faltered and was eased in the final furlong.

 Footnotes
 MILES OF HUMOR stalked the open leader from the two path, began to narrow in as three-quarters was being reached, got turned loose spinning into the
 lane, out-fought a pair of opponents from there until the sixteenth pole, then had enough left to fend off JO'[S BOLD CAT and preserve the decision. JO'S
 BOLD CAT took the inside route to the quarter pole, got angled four wide into the lane, had a god finish down the center of the course to garner the place.
 BARTLEBY tracked the front runners, loosely pocketed in the early stages, loomed momentarily with an eighth to go, flattened out. MAJOR FORCE strung
 out four wide on the first turn, was one path closer to the rail on the subsequent one, got sent out into path five during the initial portion of the stretch, rallied
 mildly. DIPLODOCUS three wide on the opening bend, travelled towards path four on the far turn, was moved outward a couple of paths after stepping into
 the lane, made no headway. ON PATROL pinched at the break, sat reserved in the two path, got spotted five wide in upper stretch, made no impact after
 being given its cue. CAVALLOTTO rode the rail to the five-sixteenths pole, lacked the necessary stretch response. BEST SURPRISE appearing a bit keen
 after springing from the starting gate, spurted away, set the first three fractions having faced no pressure, felt an uptick coming up to the quarter pole, got
 headed with approximately a furlong remaining and backed away. DOOLEY sluggish racing on the first turn, slipped into two path at the top of turn
 two,never got involved. CHAMPAGNE EVENT quickly guided over to the rail, was never heard from.

 Footnotes
 CATCH A CAB broke out a step at the start bumping WONDERMEISTER, chased three wide from near the rear coming under encouragement with
 five-sixteenths to run, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to overhaul the leader a sixteenth out, then prevailed going away at the
 end. ELENZEE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, raced in the two path through the turn patiently
 handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, inched away under a drive coming under growing threat inside the final furlong, got overhauled a
 sixteenth from home, then ran on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. OUTRAGEOUS BET three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got set down
 spinning three wide into upper stretch, angled in to the two path straightened away and kept on for the show honors. CALLANT prompted the pace from the
 two path between foes under coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, got shaken off a bit nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch in
 behind the leader and weakened in the final furlong. SUMMER MISCHIEF chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled three wide
 into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. WONDERMEISTER bumped at the start by CATCH A CAB who broke out a step, chased just off the inside
 from near the rear until tipped out three wide at the three-eighths placed to urging, swung four wide at the quarter pole, made no impact. PECULIAR
 SENSATION four wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. RIVER KNIGHT
 prompted the pace three then four wide outside a pair under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled in to spin just off the inside for home, then tired through
 the stretch. LUZINSKI chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, tired.

 Footnotes
 CLAIRVOYANT LADY put to some brisk encouragement for the first few jumps, established control in short order, moved inward and got set up at a slight
 distance from off the inside, sailed along on a loosely-contested lead, was called upon for more spinning into the lane, scampered away to begin the final
 furlong in possession of its largest lead, squandered some of it when wrapped up in the final seventy yards. STAY FOND along the outside throughout, was
 under a ride taking up the chase three wide on the turn, swung into the stretch and rallied for the place. ARCHUMYBABY remained along the inside,
 seemed a bit on the muscle closing the gap on the backstretch, was given her cue angling three wide into the stretch, got outfinished and had to settle for
 the show. MADAME BARBARIAN hung out three to four wide on the turn, tipped out into path six after stepping into the stretch, made no headway in the
 last eighth. SMILE BIG shown on close circuit TV getting a shoe repair, came away alertly, stalked the winner two to three wide and gave way.
 MADDIZASKAR off a length slow after lunging at the break, went on to save ground to no avail. WOUNDWITHHEREYES pursued the front runners
 stationed in path two, shifted path six from upper to midlane, trailed.

 Footnotes
 THEATERINTHEROUND three wide through the dog legged chute into the backstretch, settled three wide in mid pack patiently handled until tipped four
 wide nearing the five-sixteenths put to encouragement, circled four wide into upper stretch into striking range, rallied to overtake the leader in tandem with
 NEW PASS nearing the eighth pole, dug in dueling with that rival to the sixteenth marker, shook off that foe when confronted outside by the late surging
 SPRING DRAMA and dug in gamely to prevail on the wire. SPRING DRAMA tossed her head rank at the start getting away in a tangle and conceding three
 lengths to the front, saved ground near the rear of the field, got tipped out three to four wide three furlongs from home placed to coaxing, angled five wide
 into upper stretch roused for the drive, offered up a good finish to close well outside inside the final sixteenth but was ultimately staved off at the finish while
 along for the place honors. NEW PASS four wide through the dog legged chute, settled three wide in range of the leader, came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, rallied in tandem with THEATERINTHEROUND to displace the leader nearing
 the eighth pole, dug in head to head dueling from upper stretch to the sixteenth marker before being shaken off in the very late stages while safe for the
 show honors. DANIELLE'S PRIDE just off the inside early on, tucked to the inside taking up cover behind GABRIELLA with six furlongs to go, came under
 coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the last major share. GABRIELLA bumped at the start
 by CHESTNUT STREET who broke inwards, tracked the pace along the inside behind the cover of the leader FANCYCASE, came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and stayed on the same pace through to the finish. CHESTNUT STREET broke inwards brushing the near
 side stall and bumping lightly with the aforementioned foe conceding about six lengths to the front when sluggish early on, saved ground at the tail of the
 field, came under coaxing past the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to improve position. QUIETLY QUICK
 attended the pace of FANCYCASE three then two wide in hand until put to coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
 took over command straightened away for home briefly before coming under threat from a pair to the outside, succumbed nearing the eighth pole, then
 weakened in the final furlong. ZECHA a bit rank early on just off the inside between foes into the backstretch, settled just off the inside in mid pack, came
 under a ride at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and tired. FANCYCASE established the front and showed the way in hand along the
 inside through sensible splits under little pressure save the presence of QUIETLY QUICK to the outside, came under coaxing confronted at the
 five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded straightened away and tired. BOURBON HIGH broke out at the start running towards the widener
 course and was corrected conceding five lengths to the front, advanced given some rein five wide into the backstretch before settling four wide in the clear
 in mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 SPARTY BOY one of three vying on nearly even terms with each other, was allowed to ease back, kept watch on a threesome from the three path during
 the run around the bend, came under the whip getting asked to pick it up at the midway point, got sent five wide heading home, straightened away and did
 battle, initially as the widest of a foursome and then from the eighth pole onward engaged in a one on one tussle with the second place finisher, was still
 heads apart with the nemesis coming in steadily during the final sixteenth, seemed to intimidate that opponent enough so as to induce it to shift towards the
 rail too, and got the job done. BEYOND THE GREEN secured a prominent position after the start, was patiently ridden tracking a wall comprised of three
 during the run around the bend, himself spotted at a slight distance from off the rail, appeared to brush lightly with the eventual winner turning for home four
 wide, fought in the middle of others for much of the ensuing furlong, left the eighth pole in a duel with SPARTY BOY, steadily shied towards the rail in the
 last sixteenth as the top one kept drifting inward, was determined to the wire, but fell short. FILLET OF SOLE disputed the pace towards the two path, got
 put to a drive approaching the quarter pole, argued from between rivals from upper to midstretch, then held sway for the show. KENYAN settled into the
 three path after the start, was three wide in path three contending for command on the turn, swung into the lane under a hard drive, vied in the middle of
 opponents for about another furlong and tired. LOST IRON cut over to the inside route midway on the backstretch, got asked to pick it up after more than
 halfway around the turn, stepped into the stretch and lacked the needed response. FULL OF MINE saved ground to the quarter pole, wandered down the
 lane six wide to no avail. UNDERCOVER AGENT made solid contact with CANIFORM in rthe shadow of the starting gate, got guided into path four, came
 under empty when put to an abbreviated drive at the half mile pole, retreated down the lane. ONE MORE ROUND along the rail, vied to hold off two others
 to the outside on the turn, gave in once into the stretch. CANIFORM bumped at the start, stepped off the backstretch three wide, strolled into the lane with
 little left and faded.

 Footnotes
 GREAT SOUL just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a good kick to
 issue a challenge through the final furlong battling among a quartet between foes three deep, dug in to take command in the final jumps to the wire to score.
 MALIBU STACY fractious in the gate prior to the start, established the front shortly after the break and showed the way in hand along the inside through
 solid splits under some pressure from MO KNOWS to the outside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and then a trio
 battling determined to the inside of those rivals but was caught in the final strides to the wire while preserving a share in the place honors on the line.
 WEEKFAIR (FR) three wide in pursuit from near the rear, remained patiently handled until set down continuing three wide at the head of the stretch, closed
 well outside a trio through the final eighth and missed at the finish while sharing in the place honors on the wire. RUBILINDA three wide in aim of the front in
 the clear, tucked briefly to the two path half a mile from home in behind MO KNOWS before tipping back out three wide at the three-eighths, got set down
 cornering three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home, dug in between foes through to the finish and hung. MO KNOWS
 prompted the pace of MALIBU STACY from the two path coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in
 the stretch. AMABILIS (GB) three then two wide near the rear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung two to three wide into upper stretch
 and improved position mildly through the drive. BOREALE tracked the pace along the inside in range of the front, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from
 home, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. ANYDAYISMYDAY just off the inside near the rear, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
 a ride at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response.

 Footnotes
 SAMARA got corrected after coming out slightly as the field was sent off and running, went on to assume a forward position, stalked the pacesetter from the
 two path, closed in and issued a bid as the field was being completed, took over and was called upon, edged away to her largest lead during the next
 furlong, held on well enough at the end to reach the wire first. LA NATUREL (IRE) secured the pocket along the backstretch, was forced to remain on hold
 drafting behind ADAM'S EVE late on the turn, made it into the lane and was soon angled to the outside, kicked in its best, closed in well in the final furlong
 but came up short. RAGTIME SUZY cut over to the rail soon after the start, took it for nearly a half, got sent to the outside for the drive, winding up
 approximately seven wide, was a bit erratic late rallying for the show. SUGAR CURL tracked the front runners taking the inside route, was under urging
 swinging three wide into the lane, lacked the needed late response. KICKIN KIMBERLY three wide entering the turn, swung six wide exiting it, made no
 impact. GOLDMAKESMESMILE away last, was sent over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, picked up interest as the second split
 was being finalized, spun three wide into the lane, made some progress, altered course towards the inside in deep stretch continuing to make some
 headway. FLASH ME NOT pursued the front runners for a half from the three path before giving way. ATTAINING in the three path at the top of the turn,
 was five wide by the top of the lane, lacked the needed response. BEYONDELLE saved ground for a half, angled three wide into the lane, had no rally. J C
 S STAR took up the chase from path two, got worked into path seven down the stretch, failed to muster up a solid offering. ABEJA NEGRA hung out four
 wide on the turn, was never involved. ADAM'S EVE showed the way from the inside, relinquished readily when challenged by the winner as the half was
 being completed and faltered.
