 Footnotes
 FANCY FIERCE rated a clear pace inside, increased her lead through the backstretch and around the far turn in the three path, then drove down the lane
 and was much the best. WINDSOR'S CLOUDS saved ground in the first turn and settled close off the pace inside, started a bid near the five-sixteenths
 pole, rounded the turn on the rail, then dug in down the stretch but was no match for the winner. GATTOBEABRAT settled off the pace two wide between
 horses and started a bid leaving the three-eighths pole, took the far turn on the rail, then dug in down the lane to slowly gain on the runner up. DUZIBATZ
 settled off the pace three wide on the outside, started a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, improved through the turn in the five path, but leveled off in the
 final sixteenth. CHARITABLE STEP settled well off the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole, steadily improved through the turn
 in the five path, and finished evenly. WHY NOT ANNIE saved ground in the first turn and settled off the pace inside, made a bid near the three-eighths pole,
 but weakened through the turn on the rail. LITTLE TRICKY saved ground in the first turn and settled well back on the inside, made a mild bid approaching
 the three-eighths pole, showed little response, then passed tired rivals down the lane. PAYING DIVIDENS settled close off the pace on the outside, made a
 mild bid nearing the three-eighths pole, but faded through the far turn. BIG BAD LILY was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 MINNIE BALL hustled clear while tapering in to set the pace, rounded the turn at the rail, drifted a bit into the stretch then held well under steady urging.
 PRIZED OPAL chased the pace toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail, dueled to deep stretch for second though couldn't gain significantly on the
 winner. ROCKET THUNDER chased the pace about the three path, was carried out leaving the turn then flattened stride in the duel for second. DI COLAS
 COWGIRL came out and made contact with Gi Gi's Song on the chute, picked up the chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail then leveled off
 down the lane. GI GI'S SONG came away awkwardly and made contact with Little Punches then bumped again on the chute, gave chase off the rail most of
 the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little further through the lane. STERLINGS DRAMA gave chase from the four and five
 paths then weakened in the stretch. LITTLE PUNCHES was bumped at the break then never factored. COWGIRL CHICK gave chase from well back and
 mostly outside.

 MY LADY MUNNINGS rated a clear pace inside, rounded the turn on the rail while increasing her lead, then drove down the stretch, widening, and was
 much the best. MISS BABY BETTY gave chase on the outside, angled in to race around the turn on the rail, but was outfinished. FIGHTING PICKLE gave
 chase three wide on the outside, took the turn in the five path, then raced down the lane, gaining and passing rivals, to finish well. BRINDABELLA gave
 chase two wide between horses, rounded the turn in the three path, then leveled off in the stretch. FINAL TALE gave chase well back on the inside, rounded
 the turn in the four path, moved out to the seven path leaving the turn, then began drifting out in the upper stretch but corrected course and lugged in
 through the final sixteenth. SPRING HOLLOW was through after a quarter.

 MALIBU BLUFF battled to the front and angled in to rate the pace inside, was caught past the three-eighths pole, took the turn on the rail, then dug in
 gamely in the stretch but had to settle for second. TWO TO LOAD settled well off the pace inside and started a bid approaching the three-eighths pole,
 improved through the turn on the rail, swung out to the seven path at the head of the stretch, then gained down the lane, passing rivals, to finish well.
