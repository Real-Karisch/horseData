 Footnotes
 PICKELJUICE was on the early pace racing in the two or three path inside L B GOLD, edged clear in the far turn then held safe late as P R CASH KING
 closed up the inside. P R CASH KING saved ground back off the early leaders, moved closer going to the far turn, came to the rail into the lane and was
 caught a bit tight through midstretch while unable to get through but continued well late. QUICKLEY CAT saved ground at the back of the field to the far
 turn, moved out to rally four wide into the lane but could not get to the top pair late. L B GOLD prompted the pace from outside the winner to the far turn and
 weakened into the lane. KENHEDOIT bobbled at the break but quickly recovered to stalk the pace from three wide, moved four wide to bid nearing the far
 turn but could not sustain the run. BLAZING BAD ICE followed the pace racing three to four wide and tired in the far turn.

 and kept safe to the end. TRIPLE TROUBLE prompted the pace from outside the winner throughout, continued well into the lane to draw even through
 midstretch but could not get by. AWESOME AVE saved ground in good position off the leaders but could not produce the needed late run. SMARTY PARTY
 failed to rally racing three or four wide. LUCKY GEM appeared to sulk in the opening strides and soon lost contact while failing to stride out and was pulled
 up after a quarter mile then walked off under her own power.

 MAGIC MIRACLE lunged then went hard into the side of the gate to get away awkwardly, quickly recovered to vie for the lead through the first turn from
 along the inside, edged clear nearing the lane and held safe under steady handling. ADMIRAL SHEPARD settled back off the pace early racing three wide,
 moved up while angling four wide in the far turn and continued on to get the place late. BAR TRICK stalked the pace while saving ground, moved up into the
 lane but was outfinished for the place late. MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC tracked the leaders from three wide to bid into the far turn then could not hold position in
 the lane. GONE PREACHIN stalked the pace racing two or three wide and lacked a final closing run. HOTTERTHANAPISTOL angled out heading up the
 backstretch but failed to mount a bid. A COWBOY'S FIGHT prompted the pace outside the winner for a half mile and tired. QUIROS followed the early pace
 from four wide and tired.

 Footnotes
 JERF contested the opening quarter from between rivals, continued from outside GREEN MOON RISING heading up the backstretch, kept on well through
 the lane and held safe to the wire. GREEN MOON RISING contested the pace inside rivals throughout and could not keep with the winner late. HELLO TIZ
 saved ground in good position just off the leaders, angled four wide into the lane and closed but could not reach the top ones while just up third. C O VIRGIL
 saved ground, came up the rail in the lane and was just edged for third. CAPTAIN AMANTE saved ground and moved up but could not produce the needed
 late rally. GERDY'S BOY was with the early pace three and four wide outside rivals and weakened. MCCURDY was not a threat. HARBOR BILL followed
 the early pace three or four wide and tired. INSTANT BEAUTY propped and was rank to begin through the opening sixteenth, settled into stride soon after
 and kept in contact with the field.
