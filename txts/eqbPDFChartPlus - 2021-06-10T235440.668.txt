 HEARTIFIX settled inside, moved clear in the two path on the far turn, widened under rousing into the final furlong and then was under mild urging to the
 end. REDNECK COWBOY lagged after a slow break, rallied three wide into the stretch and finished with good energy. MISSED HIM made a two wide run
 around the final turn then flattened out. ECLIPTICALS WOLF was bumped leaving the gate, moved outside the early leader in the three path before a half
 and was finished after three quarters. BROUGEVILLE ducked out into ECLIPTICALS WOLF leaving the gate, steadied along the rail entering the far turn,
 came out two wide then stopped. MAD BUM stayed out from the inside while making the pace to the far turn then stopped.

 Footnotes
 VALENTINO'S DAY opened a clear lead soon after the break, was rated close to the inside then drifted late and held. ABRUZZI'S STAR was slow early,
 rallied three wide into the stretch, lugged in under right hand whip, lightly bumped APOLLO ELEVEN, moved outside the winner leaving the furlong grounds
 and hung while continued to get in under right hand whip. APOLLO ELEVEN wasn't far back in the three path, was bumped lightly while closer in early
 stretch then lacked a closing response. ETHAN'S ESCAPADES stayed out from the inside while leading the early chase and tired in the lane. GRAY
 LOAFER made a mild late run and failed to matter. MILITARY CITIZEN was outrun inside. RUN TO THE WOODS was far back. NATHAN O'BLUE showed
 little. VERITY was finished early.
