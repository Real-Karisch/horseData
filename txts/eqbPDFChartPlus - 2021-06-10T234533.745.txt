 urging to gain the lead in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. STARLITE STYLE stalked outside a rival then three deep on the hill and four wide into the
 stretch, bid outside foes in deep stretch and continued willingly to the wire. REBARULES AGAIN sped to a clear early lead, set the pace off the rail then
 inside, kicked away again in the stretch, held on well to deep stretch and was overtaken late. HAUTE STYLE settled off the rail down the hill, came out four
 wide into the stretch and just missed the show. MY AUNT TILLIE close up stalking the early pace four wide then three deep leaving the hill and into the
 stretch and lacked the needed rally. NIGHTY NIGHT allowed to settle just off the inside chasing the pace, came out into the stretch and could not summon
 the needed late kick. LUCKY TERODA a bit slow to begin, dropped back just off the inside, angled in on the dirt crossing and did not rally. RARE
 INTEGRITY was in a good position stalking the pace between horses to the stretch and weakened. TAHITIAN LAGOON pulled between horses to stalk the
 pace and was in a bit tight after the right hand curve, angled in and tracked the leader inside down the hill and into the stretch and also weakened. NO
 NAME JUST FAME stalked inside then off the rail leaving the hill and into the stretch and also weakened. Rail on hill at 14 feet.

 Footnotes
 SEQUENTIALLY had speed three deep between horses then dueled three wide, battled outside a rival on the turn and between foes leaving the turn, took a
 short lead nearing the stretch, inched away under urging in the drive and held gamely. DATCATSA GEM five wide early, stalked outside then off the rail,
 came four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. DOWNSIDE UP chased outside then off the rail, came three wide into the stretch, split rivals past
 midstretch and got up for third between foes late. QUIET DUDE dropped back outside then away from the inside, continued outside on the turn and four
 wide into the stretch and was edged for the show. CAMMY'S MUSIC went up a bit off the rail then dueled between foes, battled inside on the turn and into
 the stretch and was outfinished for third. RUNS SWEET had speed between horses then stalked off the rail, went outside foes into the turn, bid three deep
 leaving the turn and into the stretch and weakened some in the final furlong. SOFT TRIP a bit crowded at the start, pulled off the rail early, angled in some
 on the backstretch, swung three deep into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. GENERAL INFO saved ground chasing the pace, came around a rival
 into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. SEKONDI a bit slow to begin, chased inside, went outside a rival into the turn, angled back to
 the inside on the turn and did not rally. NICE GUYS FINISH stalked between horses then just off the rail or outside a rival to the stretch and weakened. IF
 UR NOT EARLY went up inside to press the pace then stalked along the rail on the turn and weakened in the drive. BAROQUE broke a bit slowly then
 dropped back off the rail, angled in on the turn and was not a threat. CORNELIUS had speed four wide then between foes, stalked outside a rival leaving
 the backstretch, dropped back between foes into and on the turn and gave way.
