 Footnotes
 LEUCOTHEA bobbled at the start but broke with the field, stalked off the rail, bid outside the early leader to take the advantage on the turn, inched clear
 leaving the turn and widened in the lane under a moderate hand ride while drifting in a bit. ORQUIDIAS BIZ chased off the rail or outside a rival, continued
 off the inside on the turn and three wide into the stretch and gained the place. STELLAR SOUND stalked outside a rival then off the inside on the turn and a
 bit wide into the stretch, drifted in some in the stretch and held third. ROADRUNNER'S HONOR settled a bit off the rail then outside a rival on the turn,
 angled in some in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SPITEFULNESS saved ground stalking the pace, dropped back on the turn, came out into the
 stretch and gave way. BIDDY DUKE had speed inside to set the pace, dueled briefly inside the winner midway on the turn, dropped back leaving the turn
 and through the stretch and had nothing left for the drive then was eased in the final furlong.
