 HEARTLESS SOFIYA broke sharply to show the way, responded to challenge from MISS MCFAD leaving the turn, match strides through the drive, lost the
 advantage, battled gamely inside and held off rival. MISS MCFAD sat just off the pacesetter, joined the leader leaving the turn, gained a narrow advantage,
 battled determinedly but was out finished. PRINCESS ROBBI saved early inside and lacked the kick that was needed. SPANISH DIVA hurried away, saved
 ground inside and bid belatedly. BRASHANDSASSY was reserved off the pacesetters early and faded gradually. MISTANOTE reserved and lacked a bid.
 SOBER VOW offered little. BIFFY sat mid pack, swung out leaving the turn, lodged a bid, fell early stretch, did not finish and was vanned off.

 I TRICKED MY RIDE raced wide into the turn, went in pursuit of the leaders, closed steadily and got by just in time. POP'S LITTLE GIRL quickly went to the
 front, held off challenge from TEXAS ALLEY KAT and was ran down late. WOODBRIDGE MISS unhurried early, shifted out four-wide leaving the turn and
 rallied belatedly. WILKO LOVESONG dropped back through the turn, circled outside, closed determinedly and surged late. PHINALYWYN unhurried early,
 shifted inside early stretch and lacked the kick needed. TEXAS ALLEY KAT stalked the leader, moved up menacingly leaving the turn and wilted in the
 stretch. MOON BLOSSOM steadied into the turn and offered some late run. GLITTERINMYEYE lacked a serious bid.
