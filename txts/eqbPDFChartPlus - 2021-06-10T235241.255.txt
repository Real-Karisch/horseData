 ATLANTIC SLEW set the pace while under pressure into the turn and in the two path, inched clear into the lane then continued to slowly widen to the end
 then was reported to have bled. DESERT THIEF chased the winner from the three path through the turn, continued close up into the lane, could not keep up
 with the top one through the final eighth and settled for second best. RADIANTRITHYM raced in the two path through the turn while between rivals and
 moved up for the minor share while not a threat to the top two. AMERICAN HOLIDAY lunged at the start and settled about four lengths behind the others,
 moved up three wide through the turn and passed a couple tired ones while never a threat. SISTER JIB chased the pace from the three path through the
 turn, pursued the top two into the lane then was empty inside the eighth pole. MISCHIEVIOUS KAT was never a factor while four wide through the turn.
 CLASSIC BO chased the pacesetters into the turn then steadily faded.

 Footnotes
 ITS A JOURNEY tracked the dueling challengers while near the inside into the far turn, moved off the inside after mid-turn, bid three wide nearing the
 quarter pole, gained the lead when straightening in the lane then edged clear soon after and was under a drive to the end while slowly extending the
 advantage. LUNAR APPROACH pressed the pace two wide through the far turn, was passed by the winner into the lane then kept on through the final
 eighth to maintain the place spot. DUTCH PARROT was near the inside through the turns, angled into the four path for the drive and moved up while never
 a serious threat. IT'S THE TRUTH hustled out of the gate to get clear soon after the start, was under restraint into the backstretch, raced under pressure
 into late turn then gave way entering the lane. MAKE IT MARIA stalked the pacesetters while three wide into the far turn then was finished after mid-turn.
 MISS SHAWHAN trailed throughout while in the two or three path through the turns.

 Footnotes
 OVERANALYZER raced in the three path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the four path and steadily reeled in the leader
 catching that one at the wire. STAYONTHEGRIND was quickly clear, raced near the rail through the turn while remaining on a clear lead, was all out late
 and just denied. ALGO FIRST was unhurried while saving ground through the turn, stayed on the rail into the lane, came off the inside after the eighth pole
 and was rolling late but ran out of real estate. WAR BRIDLE raced in the four to the three path through the turn then moved up in the lane while not a threat.
 NO PICTURE CHARLIE was in the four to the three path through the turn and was empty in the lane. DEVILISH CHARM chased the pace from the two path
 through the turn then faded through the lane.

 Footnotes
 TOLSTOY set the pace from the outset while near the inside, was under pressure into the lane and gamely held. LUVINMEISEASY stalked the pace from
 the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane, inched up and loomed a serious threat an eighth out and then could not get past while turning in a good
 effort. SEKONDI saved ground through the turns while never far back, came off the inside into the lane and slowly gained. SILVER G T O was in the three
 path through the turns then finished evenly while well positioned. PATRIOT DRIVE raced along the inside throughout and offered a belated gain while never
 a serious threat. SUNRISE HAWK was in the two path through the turns, shifted into mid-track for the drive and managed some gain while not a threat.
 BOURBON N LIME chased the pacesetters from the two or three path through the turn and weakened in the drive. HUSKY CLIPPER raced along the inside
 through the turns and never was a factor. ROLLIN SMOKE was in the two or three path through the turns and made no impact. SLICKLY DONE was outrun
 throughout while in the two path.

 TIZ TRISH led inside, was bumped late and lasted under steady handling. SAVVY SHIPMAN pressed the pace outside of the winner, bumped that one late
 and was outfinished. The Stewards disallowed an objection against the winner. J. A. CURLIN stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole, but
 couldn't get to the top two. LET'S ROLL raced in the three path and rallied late. FLAWSOME raced five wide, offering a mild late bid. WOODY'S REWARD
 raced inside. TOUCH OF GRACE was off awkwardly, angled inside early and had no bid. SKIP'S SONG stalked the pace inside, then was taken up nearing
 the quarter pole in tight quarters. SAN DIMAS HIGH trailed the field and lost contact in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 LUNA ROSA stalked the pace in the two path, bid at the eighth pole and was up in time under steady urging. V J'S BET pressed the pace outside, bid at the
 eighth pole and was outfinished. GREAT EMMY M sprinted clear in the two path, then couldn't hold off the closers. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL raced inside but
 had no late bid. RESONATE improved position late inside. JORDAN'S KITTEN raced evenly in the three path. DON'T TELL LYDIA raced evenly. SHOWED
 UP LATE was not a factor inside. LADY CREED stalked the pace early in the four path before fading. MARCHENWALD was not a factor.
