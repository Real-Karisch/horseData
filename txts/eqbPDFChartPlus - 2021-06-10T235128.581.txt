 PANAMA ED coaxed along chasing inside, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out a furlong from home, rallied to get up in the final jumps to score.
 MERGER OF BANKS stumbled at the start, showed the way from the two path under some pressure to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home,
 came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away briefly a furlong out, dug in and was caught in the final
 jumps and forced to settle for the place honors. THREE GOALS broke in at the start bumping BUSTIN TO BE BAD, chased three then two wide coming
 under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, tipped out four wide at the three-sixteenths, then to the five path a furlong out, offered up a
 mild kick to secure the show honors. LUTHERAN RAGS bumped off stride at the start due to pressure from FRENCHANA veering inwards, chased along
 the inside and was steadied off heels half a mile from home, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out
 three wide at the three-sixteenths following the tip out from the aforementioned foe, attempted to tip out once more and was denied the move a furlong out,
 then had ZENATO drift in front and briefly steadied before being roused to get up and improve position for the last major share. BUSS THE BELL chased
 three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in among a quintet a furlong out before weakening in the late
 stages. ZENATO prompted the pace four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung five wide for home, dug in under a drive drifting out
 inside the eighth pole and weakened in the late going. FREUDIAN ANALYST chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide
 for home, weakened in the stretch. GHOST BLOCK got slammed into at the start by FRENCHANA veering inwards and in turn bumped PAGANINI into
 LUTHERAN RAGS, chased just off the insdie from near the rear, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled seven wide for home and made no
 impact. PAGANINI bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe due to pressure from FRENCHANA and in turn bumped LUTHERAN RAGS, chased three
 wide from near the rear under urging from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. FRENCHANA veered in at the start
 slamming into GHOST BLOCK causing a chain of bumping down through LUTHERAN RAGS, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
 seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and never menaced. BUSTIN TO BE BAD bumped at the start by THREE GOALS, showed brief speed chasing
 just off the inside, retreated under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside for home and faltered. There was a Stewards' Inquiry as well
 as a Jockey's objection by the rider of LUTHERAN RAGS alleging interference against THREE GOALS in the stretch run before the result stood and the
 race was declared official.
