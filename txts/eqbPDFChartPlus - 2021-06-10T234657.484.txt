 Footnotes
 RISKIN tracked the early pace, circled eight wide through the turn, took control at the sixteenth pole and edged clear for the win. ONE LAST HIT set a
 pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, drifted out in mid stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. LA SWIFT stalked
 the early pace, angled out in early stretch and was empty late. CLASSICAL HY forced the early pace, went four wide into the turn and tired. TOY'S PARTY
 was unhurried early, went three wide into the turn and never fired. COWBOY MOVIE was up close early, raced between rivals into the turn and faded.
 BRENDA'S BAR was outrun early, raced along the inside into the turn and flattened out. HIP TO BE DON trailed throughout.
