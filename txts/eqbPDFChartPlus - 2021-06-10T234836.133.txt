 Footnotes
 ITSHOULDBEFINE ducked out into ONE REAL COWBOY leaving the gate, angled to the rail once clear after going a furlong and was under brisk urging
 through the lane. THE TRAIN came out from the inside while chasing the winner and couldn't gain. ONE REAL COWBOY was bumped leaving the gate,
 raced two wide between horses around the turn and lacked a closing. EYES OF ZEUS raced four wide outside horses around the turn and continued
 evenly. JASPER K stayed along the rail and tired. UNSUNG HERO dwelt in the gate, left several lengths behind the field and couldn't catch up. WOODY
 CAN RUN wasn't far back in the three path into the turn then stopped in the lane.

 Footnotes
 JONATHANTOQUICK settled in midpack in the two path, angled out from behind foes and made a bold five to four wide bid for the lead into the far turn,
 forged clear from his inner foe in upper stretch, then held WARLEGGAN at bay in the late stages under driving pressure. WARLEGGAN trailed two wide
 early on, shifted out and made a five wide rally around the far turn tracking JONATHANTOQUICK's move, sustained his rally rally in upper stretch to pass
 the tiring early leader for place at the furlong marker, then mounted a grinding bid for the lead approaching the wire, but was fended off. NOT FAKE NEWS
 set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of TUFF DUFF down the backstretch, put that foe away into the far turn, but was collared by
 JONATHANTOQUICK at the five sixteenth pole, gave way to that foe in upper stretch, held place to the furlong marker, then maintained show to the wire.
 HOLLYWOOD HANDSOME stalked from the pocket, but failed to keep pace with the leaders passing the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane to be a
 clear fourth. JOINT STRIKE trailed along the inside, swung to the five path while still trailing turning for home, then passed tired rivals. TUFF DUFF
 prompted then dueled for the lead two wide into the backstretch, but weakened between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole. SIDEWALK
 PROPHET stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace into the far turn, and subsequently weakened between horses. MALIBU AT MIDNIGHT stalked four
 wide, but was driven to stay in range of the leaders into the far turn, offered little response, and weakened.

 MENLO PARK stayed out from the rail while slow early, angled out into the four path nearing the stretch, closed outside and was up late. CHITOWN wasn't
 far back outside, advanced the three path around the turn, took over from the outside leaving the furlong grounds and gave way late. FIREINTHEPULPIT
 raced two wide between horses with the early pace, bumped with QUEEN'S BIRD in early stretch while close to the rail and faded through the final furlong.
 RING THE BELLA stayed in the two path into the turn, swung out entering the stretch and outlasted tired ones. QUEEN'S BIRD dueled three wide, bumped
 with FIREINTHEPULPIT while inside the winner in early stretch, stopped and was eased up late. SOUTHAMPTON PRIDE raced with the pace along the

 ISLAND ROMANCE advanced inside of horses from midpack through the far turn to tracked the leader into the lane, bid for the lead in upper stretch,
 reached it passing the furlong marker, then held IF YOU ONLY KNEW's rebid at bay approaching the wire. IF YOU ONLY KNEW was keen vying for the
 lead inside of ELAN around the first turn, took back into the backstretch, switched outside to stalk in the three path, remained under a tight hold, stalked
 three wide passing the half mile pole and through the far turn, failed to keep pace with the leaders turning for home, drifted outwards in upper stretch, but
 straightened to commence a rebid in the final furlong, regained lost ground late, but missed. CANOOCHEE stalked the leading pair of duelers through the
 first turn, moved up through a rail opening into the backstretch and made a bid for the lead inside a pair of foes at the half mile pole, cleared off from them
 into the far turn, stayed clear to upper stretch, but tired, got headed at the furlong pole, and weakened through the late stages. IVANYA trailed two wide
 through the first turn, advanced slightly in the four path and outside of rivals down the backstretch, but was put to an all out drive to sustain her gain passing
 the half mile pole, failed to do so, got outmoved by an inner rival approaching the quarter pole, and then failed to threaten through the lane. TREASURE
 TIME hopped a the start and saved ground while unhurried through the first turn, was outmoved down the backstretch and trailed in the five path into the far
 turn, made a slight gain around that bend, but flattened out turning for home and weakened. ELAN set the pace from the two path, dueled between horses
 as CANOOCHEE bid for the lead along the rail passing the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace with her dueling counterparts into the far turn, weakened
 without being persisted with, and was eased through the lane. ISLAND ROMANCE RACED AS INTO THE EAST.

 CACTUS JACK advanced outside early, vied the three path into the stretch, moved clear after five furlongs and held under steady urging. WHERE YOU
 WAS made a run along the rail into tight quarters behind the leaders early on the turn, steadied along, angled out in early stretch to get clear, moved closer
 in midstretch but lacked a strong late response. GADAGO was slow early, made a run in the three path into the stretch, flattened out and outlasted tired
 ones. KNOCKTURN ALLEY raced two wide with the pace into the final furlong then tired. BOYS OF QUEENS broke slowly, raced the three path and failed
 to menace. TIGER ALLEY reared in the gate prior to the start, broke sharply, made the pace along the rail into the stretch, stopped and was eased up late.

 Footnotes
 CHARITY STRIPE dueled two wide outside of MS TEEK, forged a lead away from that rival turning for home, drew away approaching the furlong pole, then
 held sway safely to the wire. HEADED FOR HEAVEN settled far off the pace in the two path, trailed into the turn, rallied between horses at the quarter pole,
 shifted three wide in upper stretch, then kept on to achieve place in the final furlong, but was second best. HER DIVINENESS was off slow, but recovered to
 stalk the duelers three wide from between horses, was scrubbed on and chased the leaders through the turn, but failed to keep pace with them in upper
 stretch, and weakened while hanging on her left lead through the lane. MS TEEK dueled inside of CHARITY STRIPE, but gave way to that rival in upper
 stretch, and tired. SPECIAL RISK angled off the rail to trail outside of rivals into the turn, took the bend in the five to six path, then passed tired in upper
 stretch without threatening. NAUT A GIVER stalked four wide, but was driven to keep pace into the far turn, failed to do so, and weakened. HIJINKS stalked
 along the inside, but weakened passing the five-sixteenths pole and stopped through the lane.

 Footnotes
 NICE BANK stalked four wide, inched forward three wide into the turn, made a menacing bid for the lead passing the five sixteenths pole, reached the front
 in upper stretch, then drew off at the eighth pole and widened at will through the final furlong. JUMP SHOT stalked three wide between horses before
 making a two wide bid for the lead into the turn, forged a lead away from his inner rival approaching the five sixteenths pole, but was quickly hounded by
 NICE BANK, dug in inside of that rival, but lost the lead to him in upper stretch, proved no match for him at the furlong marker, and was second best.
 JOHNNY JUNIOR trailed two wide before commencing a rally inside of rivals through the turn, achieved striking range in the two path turning for home, but
 lacked a kick, failed to keep pace with the leader, then was unable to catch the runner up along the rail for place. THE LAST YANNUZZI hopped at the start
 and settled far off the pace, took the turn in the three path, then passed tired rivals without making an impact. A SONG FOR ARTIE stalked from the pocket
 around the turn, tipped to the three to four path to commence a rally outside of the leading group, but came up empty, failed to kick on in upper stretch, and
 weakened. CURRENT ENERGY quickly established a clear lead, met a challenge from JUMP SHOT into the turn, but was headed by that rival at the five
 sixteenths pole, gave way, and weakened in upper stretch. DEFEND THE BAY was outrun, took the turn in the five path, and was eased through the lane.
