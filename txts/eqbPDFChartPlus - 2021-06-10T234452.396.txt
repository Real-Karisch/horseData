 Footnotes
 LOUISIANA FLYBOY broke with the field, stalked the pace toward the inside, shifted out turning for home, challenged outside when straightened for home,
 drove well clear. AMEROCKO settled off the pace just off the inside, asked along and advanced on the leader late in the turn, vied between foes into the
 lane when challenging for the lead inside the winner, proved no match for that one, clear for the place. RASCAL lacked early foot, raced four wide through
 the turn, staged a mild rally to be along for the show. RIVER PRIDE broke on top, sprinted well clear, continued to show the way through the turn, gave way
 while continuing along the inside when confronted by the top two entering the stretch. BLUE FORTY TWO last away, was never a factor. BRAVO HABIBI
 mid pack early, steadily retreated.

 Footnotes
 DEBORAH brushed slightly start, prompted the pace off the inside, dueled into and through the far turn, showed the way into the stretch, larger lead past the
 furlong marker while drifting a bit, headed late, battled back in game fashion to prevail. AWESOME DIAMOND settled off the pace and the inside, raced four
 wide through the second turn, challenged between rivals nearing the furlong marker, put a head in front with a sixteenth to run, outkicked in the late going.
 WONDER BOYS DREAM broke out, brushed with the winner, was straightened to show the way through the first turn and onto the backstretch, dueled
 through the second turn inside the winner, continued to vie upper stretch, fell back slightly but still proved stubborn to the end. BETTY GRABLE EYES last
 to leave, trailed in showing no early foot, continued to save ground into the stretch, improved position a bit with some mild late interest. MAMA'S QUEEN
 forwardly placed while racing toward the inside, fell back the middle half, advanced to once again be in a striking position along the inside in midstretch,
 raced in tight quarters along the rail, fell back and did not threaten in the late going. FAVORITE PROMISE moved closer in the second quarter off the inside,
 began to give way in the far turn, stopped in the drive and finished far back.

 Footnotes
 A THOUSAND TEARS set the pace in the run up the backstretch toward the inside, dueled through the turn when headed, regained a larger advantage past
 the furlong marker and held the runner up at bay late. DANCE TILL TWO pressed the winner early, joined that one in the turn from the outside, put a head in
 front late in the turn, lost the advantage and fell off that same foe past the furlong marker when drifting in a bit then was trying to come again in the final
 strides. OUR SWEET SYDNI back off the leaders toward the inside, shifted to the outside when closest into the lane, could do little with the top pair the final
 furlongs, finished well clear of the others. CUSTOM PAINT JOB within striking distance early, moved out into the turn, had little left for the drive. OUR
 GOLDEN GIRL off a step slow, remained always back. HOLD THE COPY dwelt at the start, remained far back throughout.

 E LEE dueled up front while closest to the inside, headed late in the turn, brushed past the furlong marker, found more late in game fashion to be edging
 away in the final strides. COPPER CAJUN broke to the outside, was quickly straightened to contest the pace outside the winner, put a head in front turning
 for home, drifted in, brushed with that rival past the furlong marker then was outkicked in the late going, well clear of the others. STORMING BY YAWL off
 slow, lagged well back after moving out in the strip, continued outside, came five wide out of the turn, staged a belated rally to be in time for the show. RUN
 THE BANK chased the two leaders, moved closer in the three path late in the turn, lacked a further bid to flatten out, caught late for the show. WILLIE
 WEARS PINK settled in the second flight toward the inside, lacked a response in the drive. FIFTY FIVE STEEL was finished early. IDOL
 MCARTNEYVALUE faded through the stretch.

 Footnotes
 TAMMANY PARKWAY bumped with a rival at the start, raced back off the early leaders, advanced and challenged in the four path out of the turn, drifted out
 upper stretch after assuming command, was straightened and drew well clear under steady handling. ROLLWITHIT broke out, lacked speed, came three
 wide out of the turn, made a late run through traffic to willingly annex the place. RECREATIONAL USE prompted the pace off the inside, asked along late in
 the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, between horses late, not enough for the place. CHUCK'S QUEST bumped at the start, raced back off
 the pace, moved a bit closer four wide exiting the turn, flattened out to finish up evenly. ON TIME broke sharp, set the pace toward the inside, weakened
 when headed by the winner entering the stretch. WHY JOEY WHY jostled at the start, raced in some traffic into the turn, moved out, five wide into the lane,
 lacked a closing kick. ALYS APPOINTMENT closest to the early leader, began to fade before a half. PAULEY'S STAR was finished early. IBEAM reluctant
 to load, broke slowly, remained sluggish and was distanced after losing contact with the field in the stretch, walked off.

 late under firm handling. ELLIS BEHINDTHEBAR stumbled at the start, moved closer along the inside in the turn, lacked clear room behind the winner
 upper stretch, moved out, back down and lacked the necessary late kick. BIG BAYOU broke to the outside, forwardly placed three wide, a bit wider into the
 lane, lacked a winning kick, narrowly gained the nod for the show. ETBAUER'S IDE set the pace off the inside, weakened when headed by the winner
 entering the stretch, lost the nod for the show. SUPER CHASE back off the pace and the inside, came five wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally.

 Footnotes
 ILLUSTRIOUS CAT never far back while dropping to the inside the opening furlong, slipped through along the rail to challenge under clever handling turning
 for home, dueled past the furlong marker, proved best under pressure. FLASHY KITTY broke out a bit, within striking distance while widest backstretch,
 made a gain to challenge five wide through the turn, showed the way past the furlong marker then could not match strides with the winner late, clearly
 second best. ELODY void of early foot, continued back out of the turn while five wide, shifted out wider for room then rallied belatedly down the middle of the
 strip, in time for the show. GOREDCOUNTESS lacked speed early while inside, continued to save ground into the turn, improved position along the rail into
 the stretch, flattened out and was outkicked for the show late. SWAMP PRODUCTION mid pack off the inside, four wide through the turn, lacked a
 significant closing response in the drive. ROMANTIC STROLL bothered slightly start, well back for a half, managed some improvement through the lane
 while displaying some modest late interest. MAYSON HEART narrowly set the pace for a half in the two path, allowed the winner the inside turning for home
 and began to weaken. LIL MISS GREY forwardly placed while three wide, continued to be involved in the fray through the turn, had little left for the drive.
 FLASHY TIME also tired from her early efforts. GIBBY'S SPOT faded while five wide out of the turn. SEFA'S WATT prompted the issue for a half and then
 stopped in the drive. FATHER OF STORMS off step slow, six wide into the lane, improved a bit upper stretch then gave way suddenly midstretch.

 Footnotes
 JUMPING ON CLOUDS broke alertly, showed the way out of the chute, set all the pace, widened into the lane, ridden out. OSCAR'S PRIDE forwardly
 placed in the early going, shuffled back along the inside through the turn, set down when clear for the drive, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no
 match for the winner. GLORIOUS UNFOLDING broke out and then stumbled, raced back off the early pace as a result, moved closer four wide through the
 turn, wore down a foe for the show spot, no threat to the top pair. MOMENT TO MOMENT within striking distance early, behind the two leaders turn, failed
 to muster a significant response in the drive to finish up evenly and be outkicked for the show spot. GREELEY'S DOLL chased the winner for five furlongs
 then gave way in the drive. PAPA G'S LIL ANGEL remained back, failed to menace while getting out to be six wide out of the turn. SHERMAN'S BREW
 broke near the back, moved up to race in mid pack for five furlongs then backed up in the drive. BOX OF ROCKS was finished early.
