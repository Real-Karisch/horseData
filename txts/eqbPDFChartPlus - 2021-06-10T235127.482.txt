 showed some late interest. JERSEY BOB raced in striking position while four wide, bore out leaving the turn and kept on. STEF'S GUY settled, was angled
 out four wide for the stretch run and came up empty. BROKEN SMILES was in tight quarters at the start and proved no factor. STURGEON was always

 RICKSHAW EXPRESS stalked the pace, responded to his rider's cue into the stretch, took over and held sway late. CREDIT REPORT chased inside, was
 angled off the rail in search of a seam, lacked room between rivals at the furlong marker, split those foes and offered a solid bid. TRAIN WALK grabbed the
 lead, was headed leaving the turn and yielded. UNYIELDING STORM outpaced, was swung five wide for the stretch run and posed no threat. OUT OF
 MISCHIEF chased, was angled four wide into the stretch and did not factor. BEAR'S THE NAME saved ground, was urged on the turn and always outrun.

 ROCKIN RUDY attended the pace while three wide, edged clear on the turn, drew off on his own energy and was ridden out. HOLT COUNTY edgy behind
 the starting gate, dueled along the inside, was brushed aside on the turn and kept on in the stretch to secure the place spot. SURE FIRE FRIEND vied
 between rivals for the early lead and came up empty in the late going. RUSHIN TOTHE FRONT saved ground, was angled three wide for the stretch run
 and lacked a rally. LUCKY PERFECTION swerved in at the start and did not factor. TAKE ME UP BRADY was always outrun.
