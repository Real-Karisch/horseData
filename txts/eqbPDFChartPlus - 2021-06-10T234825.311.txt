 Footnotes
 ARCH OF HONOR was unhurried early three wide, remained outside to go after the leaders approaching the top of the stretch, gained command nearing
 the eighth pole and drove clear. IRISH PROSPECTOR pressed the pace outside HAIL TO LE ROI for six furlongs, rallied to gain a brief lead between calls
 near the quarter-pole, shifted over to the rail while being overtaken by the winner and was clearly best of the others. TRUE GHOST was outrun to the
 stretch and passed a tiring HAIL TO LE ROI for the show spot in deep stretch. HAIL TO LE ROI set the pace along the inside for six furlongs and steadily
 gave way after entering the stretch. STORMY JASON dropped well back after six furlongs and lost contact with the others, and was merely galloping under
 the wire.

 ETERNAL BULL was slow at the start and trailed to the turn, rallied four-wide into the stretch, was still far back at the eighth pole but continued on willingly
 to be up thirty yards out. NOBLE CHANGE dueled on the outside to the stages and weakened. MONEY MARKET saved ground battled for the lead into the
 late stages and weakened. THEY CALL ME GUS was outrun to the stretch, rallied three-wide on the turn and finished well. TAX PACKAGE saved ground in
 the second flight and lacked a rally. SPACE COWBOYS pressed the pace on the outside and tired on the turn.

 Footnotes
 BREZNO saved ground within range through the early stages, was on hold through the far turn awaiting room, got through in the three-path between TOTAL
 FUTBOL and REGAL PAL in upper stretch, caught GUNG HO inside the last sixteenth and edged away. TOTAL FUTBOL chased outside GUNG HO from
 the outset, challenged in earnest around the far turn and into the lane, and fought on to get the runner-up spot narrowly. GUNG HO set the pace along the
 inside to deep stretch, yielded grudgingly to the winner and just failed to get the place. REGAL PAL was roused sharply to bid outside the leaders with a
 quarter-mile remaining, and was outfinished through the lane while widest. TAYLORS POINT saved ground and trailed throughout.

 AMIGO'S AFFAIR stumbled at the start and recovered quickly to set the pace under good handling, lugged in in the upper stretch, was put to left-handed
 urging causing him to bump BOOMIN GOOSE a furlong out, straightened and drew away again. WHAT'S ON TAP pressed the pace three-wide, lugged in
 bumping BOOMIN GOOSE in the upper stretch, straightened and lugged in again pinching back BOOMIN GOOSE into the winner and weakened. BOOMIN
 GOOSE dueled for the lead between horses into the stretch, was bumped by WHAT'S ON TAP in the upper stretch, then was squeezed by AMIGO'S
 AFFAIR into WHAT'S ON TAP near the final furlong and weakened. FOREVER BERNARDINI was well placed and tired. ENVIOUS BID went four-wide on

 Footnotes
 PUT IT FORWARD set the pace slightly removed from the rail while being hounded early and often by I AM THE KING, dug in determinedly through the
 lane and was edging clear late. I AM THE KING broke alertly and immediately took up residence right outside PUT IT FORWARD, tried to get by in vain to
 midstretch but kept on to remain clear of the others. ROCKINMEBABY raced close-up throughout while two to three wide and finished evenly outside.
 CORUNDUM saved ground along the backstretch, took the turn in the two-path and could not gain. PHOTO SHOOT raced four wide and lacked a late
 response. IL VAGABONDO raced four wide and failed to menace. ALFAROOQ saved ground into the stretch and lacked a bid on the rail. COUNTRY
 FLAVOR was no factor while racing three wide. RIP RAP was two wide into the turn and always outrun. LOVER OF ART was slow away from the gate while
 wandering wide, gradually moved in to be three wide and trailed throughout.
