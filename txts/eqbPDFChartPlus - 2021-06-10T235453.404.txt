 Footnotes
 MITCH AND JOHN E tracked the pace of KALLA KAB from the inside, moved up to engage that foe into the stretch, vied and edged away through the
 closing yards. KALLA KAB was away in good order to duel for the lead with LORD WALTON while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the
 winner nearing the three-sixteenths pole vied and just missed in the game effort. ASSETS INCLUDED was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
 five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain on the top pair late. DELINEATOR EXPRESS lacked early foot, raced three-wide
 through the turn and did not menace. BUCKBEAK raced unhurried early, moved from off the rail through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was
 not a factor. LORD WALTON broke sharply to dispute the pace from between foes and weakened after going a half.

 through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. MEANEE pressed the pace while racing five-wide, moved up to offer a
 bid nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. WILL NOT disputed the pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. FLOWER HEART DEER

 FREIBURG broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, could not gain on that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. ONLY THE
 HIGH ROAD lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. JIMJIMMYJAMES showed no early speed, raced four-wide
 through the turn and failed to menace. DIXIE PULPIT was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing
 response. TOGRAMMASHOUSEWEGO settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.

 UNCLE YO settled off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off with little need of urging.
 STANLEY RYDER was pinched back at the break then allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with a
 steady bid. I'M THE ONE was off a step slow then raced unhurried early, advanced six-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to
 gain late. MIGHTABENTHEWINE broke sharply to dispute the pace with LUCAS HOOD from off the rail and weakened after going a half. BULLIONAIRE
 was forwardly placed early, raced off the rail through the turn and gradually weakened. LUCAS HOOD was away in good order to dispute the early fractions
 while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. ON THE CONCORD chased the leaders while racing four-wide for three furlongs and weakened.
 CHRISTINE'S JACK was off a step slow, lagged throughout and was eased through the lane.

 early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and was gaining on the winner late. FORMAL CHOICE was reserved just off the leaders
 early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. BEAUTYMIS broke sharply to press the pace from the inside and gave way through
 the final furlong. ATTA GIRL MISTY was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MISS

 Footnotes
 SILVER ATTACHE broke sharply to press the pace of SINGLE YESTERDAY while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
 three-sixteenths pole and drew off. GRAND MINISTER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and was up for the place.
 SINGLE YESTERDAY was away in good order to duel for the lead with SHOW THE POWER while racing three-wide and gave way through the final
 furlong. HUNDREDANDONEPROOF was hard to load, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
 finished with a belated bid. SHOW THE POWER disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. HE'S BANDIDO lacked early foot, saved
 ground through the turn and did not menace. I WORK FOR CARROTS was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not
 reach contention.
