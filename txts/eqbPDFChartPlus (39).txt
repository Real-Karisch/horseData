 MEDDYBEMPS unhurried to the turn, four wide run evenly in the stretch. BREWS TOONIE TOSS chased pace to quarter pole, came up empty inside in the

 horses with a strong gain in the stretch. DARK OAK dueled to the stretch, stayed on well for the show spot. SHANGHAI'S DREAM raced back to the turn,
 outside run while racing rank in the final sixteenth. PRINCE JERSEY TOWN raced evenly never far back with no late kick in the drive. STOKED off rail to
 turn, rushed three wide with a bid at the half but came up empty. TWO DOT inside trip with no response. WHISKEY CHASER close up inside to the half,
 gave way readily. YAY FOR ME awkward start, never recovered. COUNT YOUR PENNIES awkward start, never a menace. SON OF GA GA never a

 Footnotes
 STARSHIP MERCURY set the pace early from between horses, cleared the field along the turn, was off the rail into the lane and stayed clear down the
 lane. GO FOR SHERRIE stalked the pace early four wide, was off the rail into the lane with no late gain on the winner in the stretch run. BOURNE IN NIXA
 chased the pace early, shifted into the three path in the turn with a mild gain in the stretch drive. CLASSIC BREW shifted into the three path in the turn and
 moved up in the stretch. PLAIN TALES shifted into the four path in the turn and improved position. JUSTICE FOR THEMOB shifted into the three path in the
 turn and improved position. SEEYALATERBYE was never a factor. SMOLTZ was through after a half. MUNTIJ had early speed then folded up. NAIVASHA
 MONTANA trailed the field throughout.
