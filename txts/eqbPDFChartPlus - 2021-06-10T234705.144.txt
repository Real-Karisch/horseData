 Footnotes
 VIRGINIA ELOISE remained along the inside route after the field had been sent on its way, pressed the issue without benfit of cover from the pocket, doing
 so as the innermost of a quartet and while rated for a good portion of the opening half, cut the corner under more energetic handling and with sufficient room
 along the inside corrdior with which to challenge for the top, fought her way past a stubborn BRITTAS BAY leaving the eighth pole, then kicked clear, asked
 for run the rest of the way home but by no means anything close to resembling an all out drive. BRITTAS BAY gained the advantage shortly after the break,
 was held in reserve showing the way, facing pressure from both sides, came under attack from the winner settling into upper stretch, was in the vicinity of
 the three-sixteenths pole before getting turned loose herself, showed some spunk before relinquishing, had enough left to salvage second. DIZZY away
 well, vied from between rivals in the midlde of opponents starting from the nine-sixteenths pole, fell back slightly as the half was being completed, was
 forced to idle behind several others during the first half of the stretch run, inched back after being taken hold then altered course into path five, drifted out
 one path on her own volition prior to drifting out three additional ones from left side pressure afterwards, made no headway. BONITA BAY strung out in path
 four, contended for control as the outermost of a foursome from the conclusion of the backstretch until the end of the bend before giving way. GLAZE put to
 brisk encouragement almost from the get-go, took up the chase from path three, came into the stretch and had no response. SLIEVE MISH in with her initial
 step, brushed the gate, was two wide entering the turn and sent five wide exiting it, never made her presence felt.

 four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take command nearing the sixteenth pole, then edged clear kept to task to the wire. LEAH'S

 and showed the way in hand from the two path, came under growing pressure from a pair and briefly a trio midway on the turn when put to coaxing, spun
 just off the inside for home under threat, dug in under a drive and was collared nearing the sixteenth marker, ran on to preserve the place honors. SPECIAL
 RELATIVITY broke out at the start bouncing around DIAMOND JEN BRADY in tandem with FAIR REGIS before pinching that rival back, raced three wide in
 aim of the front, advanced to prompt the leader three furlongs from home between foes placed to coaxing, continued three wide into upper stretch, couldn't
 match the top pair while keeping on to secure the show honors. DIAMOND JEN BRADY bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way and
 was bounced around between them before being lightly pinched back, chased four wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn advancing

 Footnotes
 UP THE ANTE away the quickest, was in hand establishing control, showed the way rated along the inside on a loosely-contended advantage, led the field,
 each of whom was being urged by their pilots in varying degrees, into the stretch, responded when asked for run himself at the three-sixteenths pole to
 extend the margin, drifted out slightly in the late stages yet still finished well in the clear. RAGING BULL (FR) sent over to the rail in short order, took it to the
 conclusion of the backstretch, was angled into path three from the top of the turn to its midway point, got roused as three-quarters was being completed,
 fanned out into path seven from upper to midstretch, straightened away and charged home with strong, but belated energy for the place. WESTERLAND
 (GB) strung out three wide on the chute, proceeded along slightly closer to the inside afterwards, tipped to the outside and unleashed a four wide run from
 the five-sixteenths pole, maintained the momentum after being straightened away and rallied for the show. FACTOR THIS puling on the bit stepping onto
 the backstretch, got eased to the outside, departed the backstretch from path three wide, was put to a drive for the drive home, failed to keep pace with the
 winner during the ensuing furlong and weakened. SEA FOAM taken back, tracked the top one from the pocket and faltered. HANGMAN in path three
 heading off the chute, stalked UP THE ANTE nearer the inside thereafter, gave way after completing six furlongs.

 Footnotes
 LUCKY LONG sat forwardly placed three wide, crept up to issue a challenge approaching the three-sixteenths marker, rallied in tandem with MIKO, then
 fought her way past that stubborn opponent during the run from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker, dug in with determination to preserve the decision.
 HARDLY MATE in the three path going about the chute, was strung out slighlty wider on the fuller turn, was let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole then
 put to a drive a sixteenth down the road, rallied with good energy to get up for the place. MIKO stalked the pacesetter from path two, put in her stake for the
 top approaching the three-sixteenths marker, soon joined by the eventual winner, began the last eighth clutching to a slight advantage, relinquished
 reluctantly a sixteenth later, continued onward with willingness, but wound up losing second. LADY LOVE took up the chase from path two, doing so from
 between foes for the opening half, fanned out into path six during the initial portion of the stretch, becoming the widest of all, closed in well to earn the last
 majpor check. PEACHES AND SPICE quickly set up along the inside route, was already encouragement cutting the corner into the stretch, made no impact.
 B THREE at or near the inside tracking the front runner for six furlongs, was worked into path three in upper stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. MOMENT
 OF TRIUMPH rated along the inside for over three-quarters, got swallowed up right around the three-sixteenths marker then steadily backed away.

 Footnotes
 PATTERSON CROSS tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket behind the cover of the leader MARKITOFF, remained patiently handled through
 until nearing the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive into the clear, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong
 offering up a good kick to seize command in the last jumps and prevail on the wire. BIRD'S EYE VIEW attended the pace of MARKITOFF from the outside
 in the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head and took narrow command a furlong
 out while under threat to the outside, dug in holding determined through to the finish but was caught in the final strides and forced to settle for the place
 honors. SNAP DECISION settled just off the inside in mid pack, tucked inside five furlongs from home, remained patiently handled until angled out let out for
 the drive five wide at the head of the stretch, rallied willingly through the stretch to secure the show honors latching on the top pair as they hit the finish.
 FOCUS GROUP just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied into
 contention inside the final furlong and steadied a sixteenth out behind SNAP DECISION who drifted very slightly in concert with PATTERSON CROSS to his
 inside, then kicked on belatedly to secure the last major share. MARKITOFF established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside until put to
 coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in knocking heads and got headed for command a furlong from home, ran
 on but was outfinished in the final jumps to the wire. ROYAL ALBERT HALL (GB) bumped at the start by MILLS who broke inwards, settled just off the
 inside just off the pace, got roused spinning three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. MILLS broke in brushing the near side
 stall, then bumped with the aforementioned foe, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under a ride at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper
 stretch, offered up a mild bid but was also outkicked. SOLUBLE (GER) three wide through the opening bend, settled four then three wide just off the pace,
 came under coaxing midway on the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. Due to a timer malfunction the three-quarters fraction was
 hand timed in 1:13.83.

 RUNAWAY LUTE away in good order, sat perched in path three keeping an eye on the front runners, picked up interest when let out a notch leaving the
 five-sixteenths marker, was already in front when called upon for his best deep into the furlong grounds, scampered away. RIFF RAFF angled in sharply
 springing from the starting gate, was taken hold and pulled off SYNDERGAARD but not before bumping hard with that opponent, took up the chase from
 path two, got set down midpoint on the turn, fanned outward for the drive home, until five wide when done, rallied for the place. STRETCH'S STONE tracked
 the front runners spotted at a slight distance from off the inside, came under a ride leaving the five-sixteenths pole, was worked into path four from upper to
 midstretch, mustered up a mild response suficient enough to claim the show. MR. BUFF was in hand sparrnig with his stablemate from the two path, got
 overwhelmed in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker and backed away. BENEVOLENCE travelled three wide on the turn, went down the lane in
 path seven without making any impact. HEAVY MEDDLE vied for control from along the inside, came under a drive prior to the quarter pole, got reelded in
 and faltered. SYNDERGAARD bobbled slightly after bumping soundly with RIFF RAFF in the shadow of the starting gate, cut over to the rail, remained
 along it hand urged during the run around the bend, angled two to three wide into the lane under a drive, failed to fire appreciably. ARTHUR'S HOPE parked
 out four wide on the turn, gave way. Due to a timer malfunction the three-quarters fraction is unavailable.

 Footnotes
 KITTEN'S COVERGIRL attended the pace two to three wide under rating, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside for home,
 rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, inched away under a drive, dug in and held safe kept to task. AMERTUME steadied off the heels of
 BECKONING seven furlongs from home as that rival crossed in front, tracked the leader from the pocket coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
 three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. CLOSING STATEMENT just off the inside in mid pack, came under coaxing
 at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped out nearing the eighth pole nudging TOCAME LINDA and closed willingly to garner
 the show honors. DATA DEPENDENT two to three wide in mid pack, tipped four wide at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, kicked on
 belatedly to secure the last major share. FAIRY LINK just off the pace just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
 five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position in the stretch. BECKONING (IRE) established the front and showed the way
 in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in and was displaced with three-sixteenths to go,
 weakened through to the finish. MATTY'S MAGNUM four wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide
 into upper stretch, passed tired rivals in the drive. CITY DAY stumbled badly at the start tossing the rider off balance forcing the brief loss of the off side iron,
 had the rider regain the iron shortly after the start and ranged up to settle just off the inside at the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
 three wide for home and tired. TOCAME LINDA just off the pace three to four wide, came under a ride at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper
 stretch, got nudged and bumped by CLOSING STATEMENT straightened away and tired. NIGHT TIME LADY three to four wide near the rear, came under
 coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung five wide at the quarter pole and tired. GOLDEN ORB bobbled at the start, chased three to four wide until tucked
 to the two path half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on the far turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 LUNE LAKE settled into the pocket shortly after the start, was patiently ridden keeping watch on the front runners, slipped out as the half was being
 completed, was between rivals spinning into the lane, responded when asked a few strides later to take charge, remained in the clear, kept to the task at
 hand. NAZAY made it over to the inside in short order, took it for the opening half, got cued up working its way into path three during the opening half of the
 stretch run, finished willingly en route for the place. MAGICAL ROMANCE guided over to the rail, was still along the inside route coming into the lane,
 angled to be outside the weakening former pacesetter in midstretch, flashed good energy rallying for the show. YOUTH GONE WILD pursued the pace
 towards path three on the turn, was sent out into path seven making her way down the stretch, held on reasonably in the final furlong to earn the final
 significant slice of the pot. PRINCESS RASHELLE carved out the pace being rated along the inside, came under a double-barrelled assault as the second
 split was being finalized, succumbed to the top one soon afterwards then steadily backed away. THAT'SNOTHERNAME remained along the inside after the
 field had been sent on its way, was pulling on the bit travelling on the backstretch, shifted into path five from the head of the stretch to the eighth pole, made
 no impact. CAITRIONA broke to the outside, exchanging bumps with its next door neighbor, in addition to have a negative impact on two others, took up the
 chase iin path two on the turn, stepped into the stretch and lacked a solid offering. SEATTLE FROST pinched at the start, setlted into path three by the
 conclusion of the backstretch, swung out into path six for the drive home, had no offering. STARSHIP ROCKETTE squeezed at the start, loped along in path
 two for the opening half, wandered out into the eight path down the lane to no avail. ZECHA stalked the pace two wide, got asked for more by the
 five-sixrteenths pole, gave way after completing the half. AUSSIE AHVEE lightly bumped several times and pushed in slightly right after the start, was under
 a firm hold rushing up into a prominent position, sat three wide continuing along well held, unleashed an abbreviated bid as the widest of the front runners
 making their way into the stretch then gave way.
