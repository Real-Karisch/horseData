 Footnotes
 GEMOLOGISTER sped to lead then quickly under pressure from MOON PISTOL, dueled with rival through turn, maintained length lead on top then
 challenged by SIR SENESCAL at sixteenth pole, had more in reserve, held off rival and remained firm. SIR SENESCAL raced off the top two leaders racing
 well clear over next pursuer, raced forward to challenge winner at sixteenth pole, could not get by game foe, finished clearly second best.
 GETTININTOMISCHIEF raced off the pace, saved ground into stretch and got up for show. MOON PISTOL pressed then dueled for the lead with winner,
 could not match strides out of turn but continued up close then came up tired and faded, edged late for show. BEAU SPLASH raced off the pace, three to
 four wide into stretch without making impact. RHOMBUS raced off clear trio, dropped back, eased to wire then walked off.

 to move by rivals while angling closer to inside and finished clear. ORDINARY LOVE stalked the leader through the backstretch, made bid for rival at quarter
 pole, dueled with CUCKOO KENIA at eighth pole then failed to be match when winner kicked by. PILLANGO stalked along inside, hustled up leaving far
 turn, angled out three to four wide upper stretch, continued steady bid and finished on equal terms with CUCKOO KENIA for show. CUCKOO KENIA set the
 pace, held narrow lead into stretch, dueled at eighth pole with ORDININARY LOVE then gaveway and finished on equal terms for show. SCHMISS raced
 midpack though backstretch, hustled up three to four wide upper stretch, kept on evenly. STAR GALA raced off the pace, produced bid racing widest in
 stretch, needed more to threaten. VOILA LA VICTOIRE (IRE) raced in last flight, hustled up in far turn, raced along outside upper stretch then angled in,
 showed response then lacked needed kick for impact. SWAPL stalked through middle stages, hustled up in far turn then weakened in stretch. CONQUEST

 two wide in stretch and got up for share. CAGLIARI slammed between and steadied at start, hustled up and was closet pursuer off leader through
 backstretch, chased pace in the turn then weakened and edged for share. UNCLE CARLITO steady urging off inside in early going, three wide bid through
 turn then five wide without impact in the lane. MR. NOBODY broke near back then under steady urging to no avail. MY HEART DOMINUS veered out at
 start, chased the pace through early stages then started to weaken midway through turn, raced wide in lane. URBAN BUCKEYE bumped hard at start and
 failed to respond.

 control from EROTIC KISS then held safe over gaining PRAY PRAY PRAY. PRAY PRAY PRAY rated five wide through backstretch, made outside bid in

 show. FLYING QUEEN raced off the pace then wide bid in stretch, just missed capturing show. PERFECT STATE raced off the pace, bid seven path upper
 stretch then angled in closer late and just missed show. LITTLE NECK raced midpack along rail then along outside in stretch, failed to move on. EROTIC
 KISS dueled for the lead through the backstretch, shook free turning for home tehn outkicked by winner a furlong out. HAND ME THE CASH raced in back
 and failed to rally. CAN YOU SEE ME dueled for the early lead racing outside of EROTIC KISS, could not match strides turning for home then faded in lane.
