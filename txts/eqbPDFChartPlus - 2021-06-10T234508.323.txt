 Footnotes
 MISS MO MENTUM bumped with MY FAVORITE GIFT at the start, was taken outside up the backstretch and allowed to settle, moved up readily without
 need of urging four wide around the turn, was tapped on the right shoulder while taking over outside LUZMIMI PRINCESS at the top of the stretch, and drew
 away in hand. ALLIYA'S STORY lagged well back early, began moving two wide while roused sharply on the turn, went to the rail for the drive and wore
 down LUZMIMI PRINCESS for the runner-up spot late. LUZMIMI PRINCESS sprinted clear out of the chute while well off the rail, remained two or three
 wide showing the way around the turn, yielded command to MISS MO MENTUM turning for home, and lost the place while weakening near the finish.
 BERNADETTA was slow into stride, raced well out in the track throughout and improved position while never a threat. MY FAVORITE GIFT bumped with
 MISS MO MENTUM at the start, ranged up to go after the pacesetter three to four wide through the turn, and drifted to the five-path past the quarter-pole
 while giving way. BEAUTIFUL WIFE saved ground early, came three wide off the turn and made no impact. MARIEALENA pressed the pace toward the
 inside and faded soon after going a half-mile. WEEKEND MISCHIEF raced close-up between horses approaching the turn, then had nothing left.

 closer order in the far turn, raced wide at head of the lane, set down driving right handed, angled closer inside while quickly gaining on leaders, switched to
 right hand when GOLDEN ORB began to drift out, got bumped sideways but remained sharp and game to prevail. GIFT OF GLORY raced in or near the
 back positioned along outside, got hung out seven wide leaving the backstretch, roused for more much the widest in upper lane, steadily rallied up to
 capture place. GOLDEN ORB was bit keen while rated between rivals going through the backstretch, picked up the pace in the far turn, roused forward
 three wide near eighth pole, felt outside rivals closing in, came under left handed drive, drifted out and bumped into MALIBU SAINT and caused FILFILA to
 check back in late drive. FILFILA settled nicely while positioned near midpack to the far turn, hustled up in far turn, continued to gather momentum into
 stretch, went to move between rivals in late drive, got bumped and forced to check back losing chance. DESIGNING matched strides with TEE UP
 throughout the backstretch, shook free in far turn, continued to hold game at eighth pole then got outkicked in late drive. MY MASTERPIECE secured rail
 position in the first turn, stalked through the backstretch then waited for room three furlongs out, edged back, angled out a path then moved back to rail,
 came under a drive, gained position then evened out. STAINLESS saved ground throughout early stages, made move between rivals in far turn, altered
 course upper stretch, lacked needed response for late impact. HOMEMADE SALSA got bumped at the start then raced five wide in first turn, moved up in
 close range after opening quarter, made move for the lead near quarter pole, pressured rival but could not reach equal terms, flattened in final furlong.
 QUEEN ROSE saved ground along rail in the first turn then angled out after entering the backstretch, raced in or near the back then lacked needed rally in
 the lane. UNSTABLENTHEMORNIN got bumped just after the start, raced five wide off the pace, hustled up in the far turn but failed to move on in the lane.
 TEE UP vied for lead racing inside of DESIGNING throughout the backstretch then retreated in far turn. SUBTLE STEP raced midpack then failed to move
 on after the half. DI MARIA raced five wide in first turn, was well positioned stalking just off top pair in early stages, quickly retreated after half, never
 persevered with after fading. AFTER STEWARDS INQUIRY AND JOCKEYS OBJECTION, #9 FILFILA LODGED CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #11 GOLDEN

 Footnotes
 DIAMOND OOPS pressed the pace from the outset three wide, moved closest to AEQUOR under pressure around the turn, caught that rival with a
 determined rally a sixteenth out and drew clear. MADARNAS was outrun early, came three wide off the turn, split horses near the furlong grounds and
 finished with good energy. AEQUOR was bumped by EMPIRE POWER and forced into SILENT TIGER at the start, hustled up inside to the lead, shook
 loose around the turn in the two-path, and remained clear past the eighth-pole before shortening stride. MOJOVATION raced within striking range of the
 early leaders four wide, had no significant response when roused on the turn, and kept on evenly in the lane. EMPIRE POWER broke in bumping AEQUOR
 and causing crowding at the start, pressed the pace between rivals to the turn and gave way. SILENT TIGER was bumped by AEQUOR and steadied on
 the rail after the start, was taken off the inside for the drive and made no headway. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

 TAKE CHARGE PAULA broke sharp then quickly angled closer to inside from outside post, sat in tracking position behind RAZORBACK LADY, began to
 inch way up reaching near equal terms at the quarter pole, came out losing some ground turning for home, roused back up along outside of aforementioned
 rival, dueled gamely and edged by nearing the wire. RAZORBACK LADY was off step slow at the start and hustled up along inside to take control of the
 lead, raced under snug hold wanting to do more through backstretch, challenged by TAKE CHARGE PAULA approaching quarter pole, saved ground two
 wide while rival went five wide entering head of lane, dueled inside of eventual winner, fought hard, never gave up just lacked final kick to prevail. LIL B
 QUICK raced in range just off inside, shifted out and set down driving four wide at head of the lane, could not reach top pair but dug in with game response
 to hold share. COURAGEOUS QUEEN was well positioned and settled nicely along outside near midpack through the backstretch, moved up closer still in
 hand midway through the turn, raced in aim for lead at the quarter pole, tapped along but lacked needed kick to contend with top pair, got carried out top
 stretch, dug in for minor share but could not get by LIL B QUICK. FLORIDA FUEGO was rated just off inside in early stages, angled out top stretch and put
 to drive but failed to produce needed kick for impact. MORNING DESTINY raced off early speed but never too far from the frontend, came under a ride
 racing wide upper stretch, failed to move on. MAGIC SPELL was slow into stride at the start, continued without speed racing in the back, raced wide under
 ride at head of the lane, failed to gain close range. WRITER'S ALMANAC raced between rivals off early pace through early stages, hustled up for response
 in the turn, failed to move on. FRAU RILEY lacked speed, dropped to last and had no late response.

 BAL HARBOUR was bumped solidly by WINKING AT THEDUDE at the start, tracked the leaders from close range up the backstretch, followed right behind
 WHERESHETOLDMETOGO rallying three to four wide into the lane, closed resolutely outside that rival and was along late while drifting out.
 WHERESHETOLDMETOGO was crowded after the start as STRONGER broke his way, picked off rivals rapidly four wide around the turn, overtook
 STRONGER and shook clear in upper stretch, and held on to the sixteenth marker before drifting out and yielding to the winner. STRONGER was corrected
 after breaking inward, tracked the first flight well out in the track early, took over with a wide run near the quarter-pole, could not handle
 WHERESHETOLDMETOGO in upper stretch and weakened. FOREVER TAKEN was bumped between foes at the start, moved closer to the leaders three
 to four wide on the turn, then flattened out. COLTANDMISSISSIPPI bumped with HANDSOME FRANCO at the start, pressed the pace inside to the turn,
 and weakened after six furlongs. WINKING AT THEDUDE broke out solidly into BAL HARBOUR, pressed the pace between horses to the turn and gave
 way. HANDSOME FRANCO was bumped between horses at the start, swerved in and out erratically leaving the chute, came three wide into the lane and
 was never close. RENAISANCE FROLIC pressed the pace four wide early, gradually moved inward on the turn, and weakened through the stretch on the
 rail. BON RAISON set the early pace in the two-path while hounded by several pursuers, and had nothing left around the turn. TIP SHEET was restless in
 the gate prior to the start, broke a step slow and was pinched back, raced four to five wide and was outrun.

 in the far turn, set down six wide for drive, angled in few paths, although no match for pulling away winner produced solid finish for second best. MARAUD

 Footnotes
 JAGUARYU (MEX) broke inward brushing into LADY VALERY, tracked just outside ESPLENDOROSA through the opening stages, poked a head in front
 midway on the far turn, quickly drew clear approaching the stretch, and widened the advantage under pressure while drifting out. GLADIADORA (VEN)
 raced four wide early, moved up three wide while put to a drive on the far turn, shifted in slightly turning for home and could not menace the winner while
 clearly second best. CIGONA (PAN) moved in to the two-path early on the clubhouse turn, improved position through the middle fractions and was along for
 the show in a strung-out field. ESPLENDOROSA set the pace inside, had no response when the winner challenged three furlongs from home, and tired.
 JACKIE O (MEX) raced three wide on both turns, lacked a response after six furlongs and dropped back. DONA CATALINA (PAN) bumped with
 SANJUANERA and was knocked sideways at the start, raced within range for a half-mile and gave way inside. SANJUANERA was bumped between horses
 at the start and bobbled after being pinched back, saved ground into the first turn, moved out four wide making a brief run up the backstretch, and had
 nothing by the far turn. CROWN ROSES (PAN) took the first turn four wide and was always outrun. LADY VALERY (PAN) was crowded between horses at
 the start, dropped over to the rail chasing the early leaders, could not keep pace after a half-mile and dropped back, then was not persevered with in the
 stretch.

 Footnotes
 EL TIGRE MONO (PAN) settled nicely just after the start and raced three wide in the first turn, continued well rated through the backstretch, waited while
 ARQUITECTO made his move at half mile marker, hustled up in final turn then set down driving along outside at head of the lane, shifted in final sixteenth,
 edged by in time. ARQUITECTO was bit keen while rated off pace in early going, made move up inside at half mile marker, could not make way through
 along rail, steadied back bit and angled out, took over lead past quarter pole, drifted out upper stretch, came under strong right handed drive, continued
 good response, got caught nearing the wire. IGOR (MEX) positioned just off early pacesetter, made move when ARQUITECTO launched bid at the half,
 cleared top spot three furlongs out then lost lead when aforementioned rival swept by leaving quarter pole, continued steady bid and finished well clear over
 the rest. DON CARLOS R. sped to the lead at the start, continued to set the pace under some pressure from IGOR, lost lead to rival leaving the backstretch
 then weakened while tired in final turn. DYNAMO (PAN) raced in range along outside going through the backstretch then failed sustain bid in the final turn.
 GRAN WILL (VEN) saved ground along inside racing in last flight, swung wide for the drive and failed to move on. PANZER BARCELONA (VEN) raced four
 wide in first turn, showed response in early stages then retreated after the half. CALINICO (PAN) dropped back. HUITLACOCHE (MEX) showed little, pulled
 up at head of the lane, vanned off after the race.

 Footnotes
 MASTER SUPREME (VEN) unseated his rider while fractious prior to loading, came away in good order and quickly sprinted clear well out in the track,
 moved in slightly on the turn before going back to the three-path, and responded well to keep the runner-up at a safe distance late. FORZE MAU (VEN)
 broke in bumping with DEREK I at the start, raced well back three wide to the turn, moved in approaching the stretch and finished well along the rail.
 JUSTICIERO (MEX) pressed the pace outside MASTER SUPREME, had a clear shot four wide into the lane but was outkicked. ATENEA (ECU) chased the
 winner two then three wide for a half-mile, could not make a dent in the lead and faded past the eighth-pole. BLUE ADN (PAN) broke out into DEREK I at
 the start, and failed to menace while three wide into the lane. CATADOR was forwardly placed inside up the backstretch, but gave way after completing a
 half-mile. DEREK I (PAN) was away slowly after being bumped from both sides and pinched back, and was outrun three wide. CROTONE (VEN) struggled
 to keep up four wide approaching the turn, had nothing when asked in earnest with just under a half-mile remaining and plummeted to the tail of the field.

 Footnotes
 COLTIMUS PRIME was allowed to settled in early stages positioned five wide through the backstretch, began to move up closer still racing in hand three
 furlongs out, tapped on shoulder and roused forward approaching quarter pole to challenge JADE MASTER for the lead, came under strong right handed
 drive and kicked clear five wide in late drive. EL KURDO gained closer position after opening quarter and settled into stalking position, raced bit tight
 between past half mile pole, roused for more leaving final turn, shaken up wide for the drive, could not reach clear winner but procuced solid finish for place.
 MISHEGAS raced near the back then made quick move up inside after the half, raced up close then angled out a path and hustled up between rivals
 midway through final turn, flattened bit then put to drive top stretch, angled to rail, never gave up continued steady bid to end. JADE MASTER raced behind
 the pacesetter then applied pressure to rival in late backstretch, took over lead in final turn, fought back when challenged by eventual winner at head of the
 lane, kept on trying to hold runner up spot, came in while tiring and brushed bit in final sixteenth. TORNIQUETTE was unhurried racing in the back in early
 stages, gained racing five to six wide in final turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. ELTIOJOHNNY raced in range then failed to move on in final turn.
 GOLDEN DIAMOND set the early pace, came under pressure from JADE MASTER then lost lead leaving the backstretch, retreated. QUITE THE ISSUE
 stalked in close range then lacked response after the half. MI PRIMOGENITO raced in early contention then dropped back, eased to wire then vanned off
 after the race.

 Footnotes
 JALA JALA (MEX) saved ground early, lost some position while allowed to settle up the backstretch, began moving inside heading to the far turn, moved out
 three wide advancing steadily under her own power, caught JOYME with a quarter-mile to go, drew well clear five wide through upper stretch and ran up the
 score while kept to a drive. FRAY ANGELICO (PAN) was four wide early before moving in a bit, raced in midpack up the backstretch, came under pressure
 with a half-mile remaining, improved position around the far turn, and kept on gamely outside to go clear for the runner-up spot late. JOYME (MEX) pressed
 the pace three wide outside PLATINO coming off the first turn, reached a short lead at the three-eighths pole, could not fend off the winner nearing the
 stretch, and was outfinished for second. INMENSO (DOM) steadied slightly three then two wide on the first turn, began finding his best stride three wide
 between horses approaching the stretch, moved inside and finished with interest on the rail. JUSTICIERO fanned out five wide coming off the initial bend,
 raced widest up the backstretch, rallied past rivals four then three wide around the far turn, and flattened out. SENALERO (PAN) raced two to three wide
 between horses heading to the far turn, and lacked a serious bid. INSPIRATO (MEX) moved off the rail to the two-path after six furlongs, and posed no
 threat. LA DE HORACIO (VEN) faded steadily after six furlongs while mostly three wide. EL CUBITA (VEN) raced well out in the track, dropped back while
 being asked for a response into the far turn, came six wide past the quarter-pole and made no impact. TUKI MONTON (VEN) chased the leaders four wide
 early, could not keep up before going six furlongs and dropped far back. GATILLO (PAN) steadied slightly three wide early on the backstretch, and was
 finished after six furlongs. PLATINO sprinted out to the lead in the two-path, was overtaken three furlongs out, and stopped on the rail.
