 Footnotes
 RAHY MOMENTA was a bit reluctant to load, then broke right to the lead, crossed over to the inside up the backstretch, widened the advantage under a
 light drive through the furlong grounds and was never in jeopardy. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN bumped lightly with SLIGHTLY TIPSY after the start, saved
 ground in the middle of the pack for three furlongs, moved off the rail approaching the eighth-pole and rallied to be clearly second best. SLIGHTLY TIPSY hit
 the left side of the gate and bumped lightly with BRIGHT VENEZUELAN at the start, came off the rail chasing the winner two wide to the turn, could not cut
 into the margin and was outfinished for the place. COPAN chased the leaders three wide and lacked a solid rally. JUBILANT raced two to three wide around
 the turn, shifted further out and did not menace. HINDI saved ground and was outrun. CASIMIRA was never close in the two-path. REINA PEPEADA angled
 to the rail after breaking slowly, and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 DISRUPTOR sped clear early in the two-path through the opening half-mile, moved well out in the track coming off the turn, and was all out to maintain the
 advantage. DEVILISH MAN bumped with HALF GREY at the start, chased outside the winner throughout and bested the others decisively. RUN FOR THE
 CUP raced two wide around the turn, and lacked a solid rally on the rail through the stretch. ENDURING ARCH checked after being bumped by
 BARROOMBOUNCER and pushed into COYOTE QUICK STEP at the start, raced far back early, came five wide into the lane and improved position out
 past the middle of the track. BLAKE'S LUCKY STAR stumbled badly at the start and was off slowly, raced four wide and passed tired horses late. HIGH
 MISCHIEF bumped with BARROOMBOUNCER early, saved ground to the turn, shifted out three wide for the drive and made no headway.
 BARROOMBOUNCER broke in bumping ENDURING ARCH, continued to bear in herding that one into COYOTE QUICK STEP, went along for a few
 strides before exchanging bumps while between AS IT HAPPENS and HIGH MISCHIEF, chased outside the leaders to the stretch and tired. HALF GREY
 bumped with DEVILISH MAN at the start, and was outrun two wide. COYOTE QUICK STEP was bumped and pushed in at the start, saved ground and
 could not keep pace. AS IT HAPPENS got pushed in at the start, bumped with BARROOMBOUNCER up the backstretch, and faded approaching the
 stretch.

 Footnotes
 O. K. KAY settled nicely while stalking just off leader, applied pressure to SFASHIONABLY WILD past the half mile marker then prompted steadily reaching
 equal terms for lead near quarter pole, took lead under strong hand ride then roused right handed and kicked clear. FASHIONABLY WILD led the way under
 snug hold saving ground in first turn, continued lead the way then pressured by O.K. KAY past half mile marker, dueled in far turn and fought back upper
 stretch along inside, could not match strides in final furlong by kept along hold runner up spot. LANTIZ was served racing in the back through early stages,
 patiently ridden and waited inside instead of shifting wide turning for home, good move kicking through along rail then shifted out and finished with good
 energy. AQUEMINI was rated racing two wide between rivals in flight off positioned off top trio, responded when prompted in far turn, driving three wide
 entering top stretch, continued in contention but lacked late needed kick for serious impact. STARSHIP TRIBBLES raced three wide between rivals in flight
 positioned off top trio, brushed with outside running FEED ME CARATS later part of backstretch, moved out wider top stretch then failed to kick on.
 ALLOWANCES (IRE) saved ground along rail in range through backstretch, roused for more then failed to sustain bid in the lane. LAMONTAGNE leaned in
 sharply at the start then stalked up close in striking range with half mile left to run then lost kick midway through far turn and steadily weakened. FEED ME
 CARATS raced four deep in second flight, made some contact with STARSHIP TRIBBLES then hustled up through far turn then out wider top stretch,
 lacked late response.

 Footnotes
 BOW TIE AFFAIR raced two wide in first turn then nicely rated in range of leader positioned outside of RAY'S THE BAR, prompted three to four wide
 through far turn then poised to strike top stretch, kicked clear four deep a furlong out then remained sharp, clear. RAY'S THE BAR (GB) secured inside
 position in first turn, continued save ground through backstretch racing inside of eventual winner, steadily advanced late far turn then briefly waited for clear
 spot entering lane, angled to rail and produced solid finish. MEGEVE settled nicely under riders command through backstretch run, picked up pace two to
 three wide in final turn then swung wide entering lane, finished with good response for share. THE BULL (AUS) broke on top then raced behind leader in
 first turn, bit keen while trying to slow down bit while racing just off leader that posted strong half, roused through final turn then raced near lead upper
 stretch, failed to sustain needed kick in final furlong. ANIMAL TRICK stalked the leader through early stages, dueled with SPIN CYCLE through far turn,
 continued battle back til eighth pole then came up tired. REGAL KITTEN raced in last flight then hustled up showing interest but needed more for late
 impact. LAKOTA BRAVE raced in the back saving ground along rail then produced mild bid. SPIN CYCLE cleared and crossed inside entering first turn,
 opened up on top and continued on top posting strong half, dueled through far turn, battled back a furlong out then had nothing left in late reserve. UNIKAT
 floated five wide entering first turn then raced near the back along outside, failed to kick on.

 Footnotes
 NIKKI'S CAUSE tucked in behind the leaders after breaking outward at the start, traveled along in range to the far turn, launched a bid three wide turning for
 home, and caught SHEPUTASPELLONME from the outside in the final strides. SHEPUTASPELLONME took command outside FOUR K'S late on the first
 turn, rated along on a clear lead inside, shifted to the two-path coming off the far turn, dug in as NIKKI'S CAUSE challenged through the last furlong and just
 missed. L. A. HOUSE was bothered and came out slowly as FOUR K'S broke her way, saved ground at the rear to the far turn, swung four wide past the
 quarter-pole, and rallied widest to get up for third near the finish. KARENINA raced three wide on the turns, had aim at the leaders in upper stretch but did
 not have a sufficient late kick. FOUR K'S broke outward, went up to vie for the lead inside SHEPUTASPELLONME heading to the first turn, deferred
 approaching the backstretch and tracked from close range, cut the corner into the lane and was one-paced the last furlong. PURO BLANCO settled toward
 the rear but within range two wide for nearly six furlongs, had the rail into the stretch and lacked a response. CLOSE THE DEAL prompted the pace outside
 SHEPUTASPELLONME to the quarter-pole, and faded under pressure through midstretch. MAHVELOUS KITTEN became restless tossing her head
 around just prior to the start, reared up and got partially hung up on the right side of the gate as the stall doors opened, was extricated from her predicament
 and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

 SLOT matched strides for lead out of the chute then applied pressure racing half length off LOCOMOTION, hustled up when CRAFTY JAK loomed up
 mid-way through turn, dueled between rivals then continued battle inside of CRAFTY JAK through stretch, fought back gamely, gained slight edge late and
 held on. CRAFTY JACK veered out at the start then matched strides out of chute, stalked sitting just off top pair then given cue three furlongs out, dueled
 through turn then continued heated battle racing outside of SLOT, los edge to winner late, appeared all out but refused to give up and fought back gamely til
 end. LOCOMOTION broke in bumping FITZWILLIE, matched strides out of the chute then held narrow lead racing under pressure from SLOT, dueled
 leaving backstretch, battled through turn then weakened off embattled pair, angled out, kept along to clear share. ORBED leaned out at the start, raced in
 range of tpo trio in early stages then flattened out and finished evenly. FITZWILLIE got bumped inward while breaking from rail post, lost step then hustled
 up inside before switching out few paths, roused for more near half mile marker but failed to produce needed response, steadily weakened. DIG IN pushed
 out at the start and trailed the field, made up some ground without being factor. GOLDEN BULLET raced off early pace and failed to kick on. MAGNETRON
 showed early response then came up empty, eased to wire then walked off after race.

 Footnotes
 BOLD DADDY broke to the lead, saved ground going along at an even clip for a half-mile, picked up the tempo as challenges emerged through the third
 quarter, felt the whip coming off the far turn, and dug in gamely to turn back VANISH through the final yards. VANISH settled in easy striking range along the
 rail for six furlongs, shifted out three wide approaching the stretch, rallied steadily and was inching ever closer outside the top one at the wire. ERASMO'S
 DREAM made a run to contention in the four-path up the backstretch, forced the issue three wide challenging at the top of the lane, fought on to deep
 stretch but was outfinished for larger shares. LAYTHATPISTOLDOWN got floated out a bit four wide outside FLASHY CHELSEY leaving the first turn,
 shifted out four to five wide approaching the stretch, and gained gradually on the far outside. LITTLE NO WAY was guided off the rail midway on the first
 turn, went along between horses three wide to the far turn, came four wide putting in a mild run through upper stretch between foes, and finished evenly the
 last furlong. WHAT POWER broke outward, recovered to chase the leaders two to three wide going to the first turn, forced the issue between horses
 through the middle stages, shifted to the rail unable to stay with BOLD DADDY turning for home, and faded. FLASHY CHELSEY raced two to three wide
 around the first turn, moved inside for the run to the far turn, and failed to threaten. BLUE MOON DIAMOND prompted the pace outside BOLD DADDY and
 faded before going six furlongs. SEUSS raced mostly four wide and tired after six furlongs.
