 Footnotes
 LOST IRON settled wide off the pace, bid into the stretch, wore down the leaders and edged clear. GET THE W vied for the advantage inside and continued
 gamely to the finish. BEST CHOICE stalked the leaders outside, vied through the final turn and continued well to the finish. MUSICAL COMEDY forced the
 pace in the two path, dropped back on the final turn then came again too late. SPEEDY A. P. saved ground close up then flattened out through the stretch.
 VOW'S SON broke sluggishly, chased between rivals and lacked a rally. FINAL BLESSING lunged at the start and never recovered. CANIFORM dropped
 back early, moved closer after half a mile then faded. BENNYLUVSPOKER lacked speed and weakened steadily.

 MAXIMUS MISCHIEF broke alertly and quickly took control, widened in hand the remainder of the trip and prevailed impressively while never asked for run.
 MOTOWNCHARLYBROWN pursued the winner throughout and continued willingly while no match for the winner. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY chased between
 rivals on the turn and gained late on the runner-up. SIT DOWN GRANDPA was urged close up inside then began retreating on the turn. BANK NOTE broke
 a step slowly, rushed to contention then faltered. DUBROVSKY trailed early and was never in contention. FONTANA DI ORO dropped back after the start,
 stopped abruptly and lost contact with his field.

 WILDWOOD VACATION set the pace in four path, moved in a bit on the turn, drifted in edging away near furlong grounds and widened under strong
 handling. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS was reluctant to load causing a delay, broke slowly and then was fanned out soon start, was carried out the backstretch
 remaining very wide when trying to catch the winner but couldn't gain. NOON TIME GEM prompted the pace from the inside and battled gamely to the wire.
 PNUTBUTTER SPECIAL, bearing out on the backstretch, rallied three the wide turn, continued wide and finished willingly. VERO SUN, in the four path
 while just off the pace, angle out in deep stretch and closed. PROUD AND FURIOUS failed to menace. GLOBAL ACCESS ducked in leaving the gate then
 showed little. LAWYER ROY came out leaving the gate, had brief speed outside then tired.

 MOTHER GINGER lacked speed near the inside, bid into the stretch, split foes in the final furlong and was just up. JILL MADDEN alternated for the lead
 inside, moved clear in mid-stretch but was nailed nearing the wire. CRAZY DAISY reserved inside behind the pacesetters, angled out on the final turn then
 weakened late. HOLA PRINCESS angled wide after the opening quarter, moved very wide on the final turn and flattened out. TEUFLES AND ROSES
 dropped back early and passed rivals without menacing. PRETTY COOL CAT prompted the pace three wide for five furlongs and gave way. ELNATH
 fanned wide on the first turn, vied outside, led briefly but faltered.

 CROWDER on the backstretch. BOYD CROWDER raced between FILLET OF SOLE AND BROCKTON GEORGE and brushed repeatedly with those two

 Footnotes
 R JOLLEY DREAMER vied inside three rivals, edged ahead on the turn, moved clear in mid-stretch and held on gamely. SALTINE WARRIOR saved ground
 throughout, bid into the stretch and made a gradual late gain. GREED IS GOOD dropped back in the opening quarter, swung wide into the stretch and
 closed well too late. PHARAOH'S CITY earned a narrow advantage down the backstretch, dueled on the turn before weakening. ROSSIE VAL lagged far
 behind then passed rivals without menacing. SALT IT HERE dueled three wide down the backstretch and faded in the stretch. ESTRICKATOR vied four
 wide to the quarter pole then gave way. STREET TAIL broke very poorly, rushed to contention then stopped.
