 Footnotes
 BLOW MY MIND gradually advanced four wide on the turn, pressed through the lane and proved best. MIXO four wide passing the half mile pole, moved to
 the front on the turn, responded well through the stretch run then yielded grudgingly. SURF KITTEN bumped early then pulled and was steadied along down
 the backstretch and into the turn, moved outside to be five wide into the lane and finished willingly. UNBRIDLE ME FAST vied early, chased on the turn and
 lacked the needed stretch response. TOP ROCKET saved ground to the lane and lacked the needed rally. MONUMENTAL SEVEN up close early three
 wide, raced in the four path into the stretch and weakened. PARTICLE OF ENERGY vied early, chased on the turn and tired in the drive.

 Footnotes
 SECRET REVEALED dueled inside to the turn, inched clear, was under pressure late and held on gamely. BRAVE ACTION rallied four across on the turn,
 closed steadily, was wearing down SECRET REVEALED, had the rider lose his whip near the wire and was gaining late. JONWAINS JUSTICE raced mid
 pack, went five wide entering the stretch and finished well to get up late for show. FRENCH GENERAL dueled between horses, fell back on the turn, came
 again and was caught for third. A MITEY MAN dueled three across to the turn and gave way. LAND OF OZ raced in the back, bid inside on the turn, had
 little left for the drive and hung in the lane. BRO'S BRO showed speed to the turn and gave way. RIO NUVO trailed the field.
