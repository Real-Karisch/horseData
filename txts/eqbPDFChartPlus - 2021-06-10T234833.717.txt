 Footnotes
 AROUND THE DIAL broke out at the start then was corrected by the rider, established a good position towards the front, saved ground on the turn, was
 asked in the two path into the stretch, bumped repeatedly with MARK OF THE Z while making a bid between horses, was put to a left-handed whip
 approaching the furlong marker, switched back to his inside lead passing that marker, gained a narrow advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, bobbled
 awkwardly while switching back to his proper lead shortly thereafter then moved clear under strong handling. CLUB SODA was sent hard from the start, set
 the pace through solid fractions, dictated terms while inside to the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, came under a drive while battling
 inside of two opponents who were exchanging bumps, came out some into the final furlong then was straightened by the rider, fought hard into the final
 sixteenth but was outfinished but narrowly earned the place. MARK OF THE Z showed speed on the outside then chased the pace, went two to three wide
 on the turn, bumped repeatedly with AROUND THE DIAL while trying to hold that foe in from just inside the quarter-pole to inside the three-sixteenths,
 battled outside the top two into the final sixteenth and weakened then just missed the place while well clear for the show. PRYOR was urged along off the
 pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. FUTURE ABUNDANCE was void of
 speed, went around the turn in the four path while hard ridden, angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ZYPTO was coaxed along on the outside,
 came under stronger encouragement while three to four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. SQUARE THE CIRCLE broke
 out and a step slow, was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, dropped to the two path under the whip into the stretch and failed to
 respond. Following the race, the rider of MARK OF THE Z lodged an objection against AROUND THE DIAL for alleged interference in upper stretch. After
 the stewards' review, no change was made to the order of finish.

 Footnotes
 DUNCASTLE broke very fast and went straight to the front, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch
 and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. HORSE DOCTOR was off slow then bumped between horses and checked sharply, spotted the front
 many lengths, settled at the rear of the field, picked up stride along the rail on the turn, moved out in upper stretch, angled further out while gaining near the
 sixteenth-pole and finished full of run to get the place. SEMINOLE WARRIOR broke awkwardly then bumped with a foe while off slow, spotted the front
 several lengths, moved up then settled in the middle of the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn, gained three wide into the stretch, made a bid in
 the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole but weakened while able to get the show. NOT FADE AWAY bumped soundly with a foe at the start, moved out then
 jostled lightly with a foe early, showed speed then was taken back under tight restraint near the half-mile pole, moved out at that point, went four wide on the
 turn, was roused six wide into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. MR LEO bumped soundly with a rival at the start and was off slow,
 spotted the front several lengths, settled off the pace, moved out near the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
 stretch and failed to threaten. KALO broke in at the start, jostled lightly with foes early, settled on the outside, went three wide on the turn and failed to
 respond. HURRICANE DANCER was off a bit slow as three horses out-broke the rest of the field, came in early then was carried out, showed speed on the
 outside then chased the pace, raced in the three path on the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole and capitulated. (Rail at 24 Feet)

 Footnotes
 STRUT THE RING dropped in early, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, tracked the leading duo down the backstretch, was asked in the three path
 on the far turn, made a bid in the five path into the stretch, drifted out while in front in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. FROST OR
 FRIPPERY broke out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, went four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch,
 made an outside bid at the three-sixteenths, battled with two foes in the final furlong and missed while narrowly able to get the place. RESILIENT RICK went
 three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the far turn, rallied seven wide into the stretch, chased past the eighth-pole,
 was carried out in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the place. BAIRES BOY went two to three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the
 pace, raced in the two path on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, bumped with ALITTLEVODKA at the three-sixteenths and improved position.
 RUN TAPPY broke a bit slow, settled on the inside, moved off the rail under urging on the far turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, swung five wide into
 the stretch, moved into a good striking position while shifting out into the final furlong but flattened out. CADET CAPTAIN went around the first turn in the
 three to four path, contested the pace on the outside, was asked in the three to four path on the far turn, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.
 ALITTLEVODKA was taken in hand early then rated near the inside, saved ground while asked on the far turn, shifted into the two path entering the stretch,
 bumped with BAIRES BOY near the three-sixteenths then checked and had nothing left. THUNDER MESA was off slow and spotted the front a couple of
 lengths, went four to five wide on the turns, came six wide into the stretch, had the rider lose his whip inside the three-sixteenths and was no factor. TITO
 TONIGHT was away awkwardly, contested the pace near the inside, was asked on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way. Following a
 stewards' inquiry into the action in upper stretch, no change was made to the order of finish. (Rail at 24 Feet)

 contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dueled with the winner in upper stretch, drifted out into the final furlong and missed
 while clear for the place. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE dropped back under some urging, went around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide at the
 quarter-pole, came under the whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. FLIRTYFLIRT broke a half-step slow, chased the

 the far turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, took a short lead under a drive at the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage
 back to the winner outside the furlong marker and was outfinished but clear for the place while racing on his inside lead throughout the drive. BROTH went
 around the first turn in the five path, settled off the pace, was asked while three to four wide on the far turn, advanced to make a five wide bid into the
 stretch, dropped back while still on his inside lead into the final furlong and weakened. ALTITO went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the
 pace, moved closer with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, came under the whip in upper stretch and failed to

 Footnotes

 spun five wide into the stretch, responded well under threat from the runner-up in the drive and held under strong urging. NEWELLTON settled in the
 second flight, went two then three wide on the turn, gained on the winner while swinging seven wide into upper stretch, pursued that foe in the drive and was
 turned away while able to get the place. I LOVE TO RACE settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, swung eight wide into the stretch,
 gained while well outside the middle of the course and finished with good energy for the show. HERMAJESTYCOMMANDS settled towards the rear of the
 field, went three then four wide on the turn, came nine wide into the stretch, drifted out between the three-sixteenths and the furlong marker then finished
 with good energy towards the outside fence but was belatedly on the scene. ALLONGE settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the turn and
 gained some ground but failed to menace. AWESOME ONE settled outside in the second flight, was asked in the three to four path on the turn and came up
 empty. TELL TONTO settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. DISCERNMENT was off slow and spotted the front a
 few lengths, rounded the turn in the two path, came out into upper stretch and was no factor. MAGIC IN MALIBU settled off the pace, went three wide on the
 turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. (Rail at 24 Feet)
