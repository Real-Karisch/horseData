 BOBBYALEXSGOLDMARK , rated behind horses on the turn, was taken to the five path in upper stretch, gained command outside horses in mid stretch
 then drew out under brisk urging. CHOCOMOUNT , two wide on the turn, angled in in upper stretch and had a mild rally along the rail. CENT COMM
 showed speed outside JAMES RIVER early, set the pace two wide around the turn, drifted to the three path turning for home and weakened late. DOWN IN
 THE HOLLER prompted the pace three deep around the turn, floated to the four path entering the stretch and weakened in the drive. EARNED IT raced well
 off the rail throughout and was not a factor. PRAISE THE MOON , a forward factor four deep on the turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and gave
 way. DANCE THE RAILS , outrun, was six wide turning for home. JAMES RIVER showed speed along the rail, failed to keep pace entering the turn,
 steadied mid way on the turn and dropped back.

 Footnotes
 SAM SPARKLE prompted the pace three wide outside GREEK GOD, shifted a bit wider entering the lane and asserted himself while taking command
 shortly thereafter, kicked clear under aggressive handling in mid stretch and held firm. NOBLE KENT saved ground stalking the leaders, came under
 pressure mid turn, slipped through along the rail in mid stretch and continued gamely while just getting the place. RARE EAGLE settled off the slow early
 place, edged up some past the five eighths, shifted out four to five wide for the drive, straightened away and closed willingly. GREEK GOD established
 command early on, set a slow pace removed from the rail, was joined by the winner nearing the lane, ceded command with a quarter to go, gave hard chase
 past the furlong grounds and weakened late. COOKING UP A STORM lagged off the pace, angled four wide for the drive and lacked a rally. BANNER BILL
 was rank at the break, regrouped and raced wide but failed to go on when called upon around the turn. TO THE STARS , away alertly, stalked the pace four
 wide, came under pressure mid turn and faded.

 TAM TAM ATTACK broke inward and bumped with the rival, corrected and edged up nearing the half mile marker, bid three deep soon after, dueled briefly
 outside a pair of rivals, powered away leaving the five sixteenths and was kept to a drive. SMART ROYAL T vied between rivals leaving the far turn, could
 not match strides with the winner mid turn but continued on willingly and remained clear of the rest. ALL SPUN UP , off the pace and removed from the rail,

 dropped off the early issue after a quarter mile, saved ground near the quarter pole and came up empty. STARRY MESSENGER , rated off the pace, raced
 to the inside of a rival nearing the turn and failed to menace. CITY COUNT stumbled after bumping with the winner leaving the gate and failed to threaten.
 CAONAVO had speed, vied inside a pair of rivals leaving the far turn, was under coaxing past the five sixteenths and dropped back. BALKAN ducked out at
 the break, straightened and moved up wide early, chased and faltered.

 late and was up at the wire. KING OF NIGHT disputed the pace, circled the turn four wide, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly.
 HURRICANE BEAR , six deep around the turn, remained in the six path in upper stretch, had a mild rally and lugged in near the sixteenth pole. PARADE
 OF NATIONS stumbled then bumped VUE SAIGON when forced in by THE GREAT RONALDO soon after the break, raced three wide on the turn, angled
 to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. THE GREAT RONALDO bore in and forced in PARADE OF NATIONS soon after the break, saved
 ground on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. FAR FROM AWESOME hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to
 upper stretch and faded. BIG SLICK disputed the pace two wide between horses around the turn and weakened in the drive. MOONSPELL was outrun.
 REEDINI prompted the pace three wide between horses, steadied mid way on the turn and gave way. MONEY MARKET was outrun. VUA SAIGON ,
 bumped soon after the break, pulled up lame on the turn and was vanned off. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run around the turn but no

 Footnotes
 ANNA'S BANDIT angled in advancing past the five eighths pole and gained a stalking spot, was nudged along to hold position, bid inside SHE ROLLS soon
 into the lane, dueled, gained a slim lead past the eighth pole, kept on under a drive and was edging away at the wire. SHE ROLLS cleared in the opening
 furlong, set the pace in the three path, took outside pressure past the three eighths, was hooked from her inside soon into the stretch, dueled and gave way
 grudgingly. KENTUCKY LADY prompted the pace four wide outside SHE ROLLS, moved to apply more pressure after three furlongs, pressed the issue to
 mid stretch, stayed on her left lead but kept trying to the line. ROCKIN JOJO , five wide chasing the leaders, was under strong handling mid turn but went
 evenly through the drive. VANIDOSA , in a bit tight after the break, saved ground leaving the far turn and failed to menace. FOLLOW THE PETALS angled
 off the rail early on, pursued four wide around the turn but failed to respond. CONQUEST VIVI stumbled at the break and trailed.

 Footnotes
 LADYOFTHEHIERARCHY sped to the early lead, was kept well off the rail around the turn and prevailed under urging the final furlong. LOVE IN EXCESS ,
 three wide between horses around the turn, drifted to the four path turning for home, chased the winner and flattened out. ZOSIA hugged the inner rail
 around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and finished willingly. PERFECT PARTY GIRL , three wide on the turn, swung to the five path in
 upper stretch and passed tired foes. IAM A DANCER , two wide around the turn, was not a factor. NANCY R , a forward factor two wide on the turn, floated
 to the three path turning for home and gave way. GLORY UNBOUND , five deep on the turn, stopped and was eased. EYE OF THE CHUB chased the
 pace, was four wide on the turn, stopped in upper stretch and was eased. CELESTIAL GIRL trailed.
