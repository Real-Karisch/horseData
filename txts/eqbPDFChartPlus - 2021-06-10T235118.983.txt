 Footnotes
 SKYLAS GOLD quickly sped clear, dictated terms while inside to the two path on the turn, responded well in the stretch, remained clear into the final
 sixteenth and just held under strong urging. MONEYMAN JOHN chased the pace from second, went two to three wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the
 stretch, gained determinedly on that foe late and just missed while clear for the place. PROUD ITALIAN stumbled at the start then bumped with a rival, was
 urged along on the inside, moved to the two path near the three-eighths, drifted out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while best of
 the rest. ASSEMBLED LADY was ridden along near the middle of the field, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in
 outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. DR. CLARK was ridden along off the pace, went five wide on the turn and failed to rally. DARING ARTAX
 was ridden along in the middle of the field, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond. ILLUMINATINGAPPEAL bumped with a rival at the
 start, was urged along towards the back, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. COLOUR MY WORLD was ridden along towards the front, went
 three to four wide on the turn and retreated. SCORPIAN JACK was ridden along near the back, went four wide on the turn and was outrun. MATTY'S
 TRIBAL dropped well behind, rounded the turn in the three path and showed little.

 AMERICIUM tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the four to five path on the turn, took the lead at the five-sixteenths, moved clear into the stretch,
 drew off under a drive into the final furlong, had the rider lose his whip outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a brisk hand ride while much the
 best. LADY LORETTA broke a bit slow, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the turn and finished willingly for the place. MISS SID N SAY
 broke out and hit the gate, showed good speed then disputed the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied in the two path on the turn, was headed at the
 five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch, moved out at the furlong marker and weakened but was clear for the show. MIGHTY FERRARI was well
 placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and came up empty. AUDACIOUS ANGEL stumbled badly at the start
 and was off slow, moved up to contest the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and faded. GURLIN
 broke a bit slow then bobbled and was taken up, raced at the rear of the field, rounded the turn in the three path and was no factor. FIREPIT QUEEN broke
