 Footnotes
 VINNARDINI vied for command between foes from the outset into the turn, forged clear in upper stretch and was kept to pressure. DR. LIECHTY, off slowly,
 then held up avoiding tight quarters after the break, shifted out four wide racing into the stretch to split foes in late stages while prevailing for the place
 honors. ENCHANTED RAMBAM settled while shifting outside foes racing through the backstretch, angled six wide racing into upper stretch and continued
 willingly to gain position to the end. ADMIRAL SEAN tracked off the first flight along the inside, switched out racing into upper stretch and continued evenly
 between foes. FRENCH MINDED tracked off the first flight between foes into the turn but had no closing bid. HURRICANE FORCE ducked inwards at the
 start, settled last racing to the turn and failed to menace. AMAROQ, urged to press the pace inside foes from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper
 stretch. LEE'S LUCK urged to gain a forward placing three deep between foes racing just off the first flight into the turn, faded after a half. MATTHEW'S
 THUNDER, urged to terms prompting the pace four wide in early stages, gave way after a half.

 Footnotes
 LIGHTEN UP FRANCES broke readily, was urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace to upper stretch and widened the advantage to late stages
 under firm encouragement. STURN DONNA tracked off the first flight along the inside early, shifted three wide on the turn while being prompted to advance
 and proved best of the others. NURSE MEGAN tracked the leaders three wide between foes and continued evenly into the stretch while edging a rival for a
 share. W W ACE'S UP settled along the inside in the opening stages, angled out in upper stretch and improved position. DANCING LASS, urged to prompt
 a rival's pace racing into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. LOGI tracked the leaders between foes in second flight for a half but offered no rally. PRADA
 STORM settled outside foes in early stages and proved no threat. LIGHTUP THE FOREST broke very slowly, angled to the inside early and soon dropped
 out. PENNY SLOTS made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes in the opening quarter but gave way abruptly entering the turn.

 Footnotes
 COMMANDER'S CASTLE was urged clear while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, set the pace on a clear margin into the far turn, held sway
 past midstretch, then drifted out late but maintained a safe margin to the end under pressure. ALL STRIKES, forwardly placed along the inside in the
 opening stages, switched outside the leader on the far turn while being prompted to advance but proved only second best. HIDE THE EVIDENCE, reserved
 outside a rival in the last flight racing to the far turn, angled three wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to edge several rivals for a share in late
 stages. GARY LUKE brushed at the break, shifted out three wide early tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, lodged a brief bid in that path
 entering the far turn but faded in the drive. MAXUS settled along the inside early, saved ground throughout and raced in some close quarters through the
 final sixteenth. ALLIED COMMANDER, urged to gain a position tracking just off the leaders between foes in the opening half,. steadily faded leaving the far
 turn and drifted wide late. TWO NEPHEWS angled inside early tracking just off the leaders but faded after a half. SENOR BLANCO settled off the second
 flight in early stages, raced wide into the far turn and steadily faded.

 DANCING POSITION was hustled up the rail from the break disputing the pace inside rivals into the turn, shook clear nearing midstretch and widened under
 pressure. SNALLYGASTER angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight and advanced inside foes to edge several rivals for the place honors on
 the wire. DROOP'S M D B settled last along the rail in the opening quarter, saved ground to upper stretch and gained position to the end. LT DAN ATTACK
 broke in, bumping ITCHING FOR ATTACK, was righted to track off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide racing into
 upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SILVER ENERGY settled between foes in early stages, angled five wide in upper stretch and made some
 belated progress. JUSTENUFFTUFF settled off the second flight between foes in early stages and lacked a rally. ITCHING FOR ATTACK, bumped at the
 start, was quickly righted, then urged to prompt the pace between foes racing into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch but quickly came up empty
 leaving midstretch. DRAMA STAR, off slowly, proved no factor. HE'S A KINGFISH broke sharply, flashed brief pace three deep racing into the turn and
 gave way after a half. W W RUSSIAN GOLD was a brief factor between foes in second flight but gave way abruptly entering the turn.

 TIZAMINT broke readily, was urged clear dictating the pace a bit off the inside into the turn, then held sway along the inside to late stages while being kept
 to firm encouragement. HAL'S MISCHIEF angled in tracking the pacesetter inside foes in the second flight, shifted out racing into the stretch and proved
 second best. WADDLE angled inside early to track off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch gaining position but proved no match for the top pair.
 MIDNITE IN MIAMI, urged to a forward placing three deep in second flight, continued in that path to upper stretch but had no final kick. GREELEYS
 DELIGHT switched out early to track between foes off the second flight, gained some position three wide between foes nearing upper stretch but proved
 empty in the drive. BLANCO BRUSH settled along the inside early and proved no threat. HOOSESSENTIAL was bumped at the start and never menaced
 thereafter. ILLINI KITTEN, bumped, then shuffled back at the start, trailed the field to the stretch. NEVAEHA'S RAIN, urged to gain a forward placing
 between foes, lodged a brief bid on the turn but quickly emptied out. DIAL THE DOCTOR tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, was
 fanned five wide into the stretch and faded.

 SUZ broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin racing into the turn and made the balance of the pace under steady handling.
 FULL COUNT, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace between foes racing into the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch and weakened in late stages
 while proving best of the others. LION LOVE tracked outside foes in second flight racing into the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch and continued
 willingly to gain some position. QUEENS DAY VICTORY tracked inside rivals in the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no final kick. SHEZ
 A QUEENIE tracked off the second flight while shifting a bit off the inside in the opening quarter, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and continued evenly.
 MARGARITA ATTACK, off last, angled to the inside early to gain some position inside foes racing into the stretch but proved no real threat. SHES JUST
 CAPITAL settled outside foes in the last flight early and proved no threat. WAY TOO SMARTE, urged to gain a forward placing three deep prompting the
 pacesetter into the turn, emptied out early. BEN'S LITTLE CUPID tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the turn, steadily faded into
 upper stretch. BABY DO IT settled between foes and offered no rally. KINGSBURY DREAM was settled near the inside and never seriously menaced.

 WILDWOOD'S AFLEET angled inside early to track off the second flight, commenced a steady advance saving ground on the far turn, shifted outside the
 pacesetter leaving midstretch while moving to challenge, then took over and went clear under firm handling. AZEG, urged inside foes on the first turn to
 dispute the pace inside a rival into the backstretch, dueled with that foe into the far turn, edged clear racing into upper stretch but proved no match when

 late stages while gathering momentum and continued willingly inside foes late to edge rivals for a share. BAHNKE, caught five wide into the first turn, angled
 in to track between foes, then nearer the inside on the far turn, was urged to advance while shifting out three deep bumping MENDOTA midstretch and
 couldn't match the top trio. SUN BROWN settled between foes in the opening half, was fanned six wide nearing midstretch while continuing with some
 interest but was outkicked for a share. ORCUS, urged to gain a forward placing three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, tracked off the second
 flight to the far turn and faded into the stretch. POKER PLAYER, bumped at the start, settled along the inside and proved no threat. MENDOTA, pulling
 between foes just off the first flight racing into the first turn, angled inside to make some brief progress racing into the far turn, shifted out nearing upper
 stretch, was bumped approaching the furlong marker and quickly came up empty. SHABAN, urged to dispute the pace outside a rival, gave way into upper
 stretch. KELA BREW, caught four wide into the first turn, tracked off the second flight three wide between foes on the backstretch and soon faded.
