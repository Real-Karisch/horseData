 TESSERON broke a bit outward, stalked the pace, edged closer early on the far turn, bid late turn, dueled, drew clear 3/16ths out and widened under a
 hand ride. SINE METU, herded outward at the start, settled off the pace, closed gradually on the backstretch and far turn, was set down upper stretch and
 finished under a determined drive. O WANDERLUST led early, set a reserved pace, was joined late on the final turn, dueled into the stretch, was headed at
 the 3/16 mark and gave way. LIDDYUP steadied just out then closed quickly to contention, stalked the pace to the stretch and finished all out.
 SWELLELEGENT raced in midpack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then finished gamely in vain. SUPREME COMMANDER was herded
 outward at the start, settled off the pace, chased angling from the rail to four-wide through the far turn but never reached contention. HIGH SOCIETY stalked
 the early pace then settled in midpack, was hustled along the rail through the far turn but evened out in the late stages. Due to a timer malfunction this race
 was hand timed.

 Footnotes
 GET'ERDONEBUD was away in midpack, tracked the dueling trio while racing three-wide on the turn, launched his bid in early stretch and held off the
 rallying foe. LYLA LORRAINE bumped with ONE FLASHY CAT at the start, raced in midpack, angled three-wide at the 1/4 pole, bumping into MAJESTIC
 HEIST twice in the process, rallied and was second best. BE THE CHANGE broke slowly, lacked early speed, had one beaten on the turn, angled five-wide
 at the 1/4 pole and closed down the outside. I DELIVER hit the gate at the start, trailed the field, came off of the rail heading into the stretch where he still
 trailed and rallied gamely. REDEPLOY tracked the dueling trio entering the turn, raced two-wide and chased evenly in the stretch. BUDDING showed speed
 and set the early pace, dueled while saving ground on the turn and gave way in the stretch. ONE FLASHY CAT bumped with LYLA LORRAINE at the start,
 stalk the pace early, dueled while racing three-wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch. MAJESTIC HEIST broke outwards, lacked early speed, raced
 two-wide, was bumped by LYLA LORRAINE late on the turn and again at the top of the stretch and offered no late response. LOWI VENE stalked the early
 pace, dueled while racing between horses on the turn, began to weaken nearing the 1/4 pole and came up empty.

 Footnotes
 MR HAVERCAMP was off slowly, raced near the back with just one beaten early, began his advance at the half-mile pole racing two-wide, angled five-wide
 at the 3/8ths pole, closed down the outside and proved best. KING AND HIS COURT was bumped by STERLING SILENCE at the start, trailed the field,
 angled four-wide late on the turn, went to the outside path after a left-handed hit at the 3/16ths pole, rallied but was second best. DRAGON'S CRY broke
 outwards, stalked the early pace racing on the outside, pressed while racing two-wide, had a clear lead at the 3/8ths pole but was soon headed, dueled
 down the stretch and gave way. SILENT JIMMIE hit the gate and ducked to the outside at the start, stalked early, was briefly in midpack but advanced to
 stalk again on the turn where he raced three and four-wide, dueled down the stretch, was outkicked by the rallying foes and lost the bob for show.
 BUTTERMILK PIKE raced in midpack, angled from two to four-wide turning for home, was briefly in contention to reach the leaders but chased in vain.
 KATALOX raced in midpack early, angled out while still racing down the backstretch, stalked while racing two and three-wide, advanced to duel between
 horses heading into the stretch but tired. STERLING SILENCE bumped into KING AND HIS COURT at the start, set the early pace, briefly dueled, stalked
 while under a hold heading into the turn, dropped back late on the turn, was asked down the stretch but was empty. SILENT EMPIRE leaned inwards at the
 start, dueled early, had the lead entering the turn, saved ground, began to weaken at the 3/8ths pole and had nothing to offer late.

 Footnotes
 TIMBERLINE showed a turn of speed, was headed early backstretch, stalked the new leader and chased four-wide into the stretch, rebid upper stretch,
 drove clear and widened under steady pressure. THIS IS MY NIGHT stalked the pace, took command early on the backstretch, set the pace, quickened late
 turn, was headed upper stretch and held place. TEATOE, three-wide on the clubhouse turn, raced in midpack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far
 turn then finished under a determined drive. EXTREMIST, away slowly, settled off the pace, chased three-wide on the far turn then finished gamely inside.
 KY CAUSEWAY settled off the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. AWFULLY SINFUL raced in midpack, was hustled
 two-wide on the far turn, was roused at the top of the stretch but never reached contention. MADAME G, away slowly, settled off the pace, raced four-wide
 throughout, was hustled on the far turn but lacked a rally. PECHE MOBILEE raced off the pace, saved ground, was hustled through the far turn but lacked a
 closing response.

 Footnotes
 MARILYNS LAST LOVE had speed, dueled briefly on the backstretch, shook clear early turn, set the pace then held under an all out drive through the
 stretch. SWEET RHAPSODY raced in midpack, closed three-wide late turn, launched a determined drive and closed fast to the wire. LUNA D'AVRIL settled
 in midpack, was hustled two-wide late turn then finished gamely. MY RAY OF SUNSHINE stalked the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn then finished
 gamely to no avail. BELLA FABIANA settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, angled out further in the stretch but failed to
 menace. BUCKDEN HOUSE broke alertly but outward, stalked the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then evened out in the stretch. MISTY
 SPIRIT moved up to duel inside the leader on the backstretch, was headed early turn, chased to the stretch and retreated. CAPE MIST eased back and off
 the rail in the early going, settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn but was not a threat.

 Footnotes
 HOLD'EMFORRANSOM forced the pace briefly then stalked, took command a furlong out and drew clear then held sway under a drive. VAUGHAN raced in
 midpack, saved ground, angled out upper stretch then closed determinedly. STRIKE REVENGE settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn,
 lugged in through the stretch but still closed with good energy. JARETH bobbled at the outset, settled in midpack, chased three-wide into the stretch, bore in
 several times but finished gamely. BRIGHTSTONE BAY, well back early, came three-wide through the turn then rallied late between foes. ATHENA'S
 LEGACY trailed, angled out at the top of the stretch then rallied widest. MATTHEW'S RIDGE settled off the pace, raced three-wide on the turn, was roused
 upper stretch and outfinished the balance. ENGLISH CLASSIC settled off the pace, raced along the rail and two-wide through the turn then finished gamely
 in vain. ANOTHER BIG THING settled in midpack, shied away from JARETH twice as that one bore in through the stretch then evened out. MINI MILES
 showed some speed, dueled into the stretch, drew clear at the 3/16 pole but was headed a furlong out and tired. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL raced in midpack,
 came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but lost positions late. FULLTHROTTLE KID, in midpack early, saved ground, chased into
 the stretch but lost interest in the late stages. TRACK D GOLD hopped at the start and settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, hit the rail a furlong
 out and was through. HOUDINI AFFAIR set a pressured pace, dueled into the stretch, was headed upper stretch and tired.
