 Footnotes
 TARTAN THE BULL set the pace on the inside, shook clear in the lane and lasted under steady pressure. SPICY SHOT broke a step slowly from the gate,
 looped up three and four wide through the turn, made a steady gain and missed. I AM IRON MAN never far back, looped up three wide through the turn, bid
 on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. FORWARD MOTION broke through the gate pre start, saved ground through the turn, came
 through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened late. SUCCESS HURRICANE stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane
 and faded.
