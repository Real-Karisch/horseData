 shook off the runner-up in upper stretch, drew off while drifting out under a left-handed whip from the eighth-pole to the sixteenth-pole and proved much the

 the stretch under the whip, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while well clear for the place. CASH FIRST raced in the two
 path on the first turn, settled on the inside of OUR WILD DANCER, was roused in the two path on the far turn and lacked the needed response while best of
 the rest. SUN AND SAND was bumped after the start, went three wide on the first turn, was taken up slightly entering the backstretch, settled at the rear,
 was urged along while three then two wide on the far turn, dropped to the rail near the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. OUR WILD DANCER broke in
 and bumped with a rival then was forced out and in tight, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four wide on the far
 turn, came five wide into the stretch and faltered. HALF CAJUN bumped with a rival at the start then came out, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the

 Footnotes
 SHE'S PLAIN JANE jostled with a rival at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, ranged up in the two path on the turn, made an outside bid at the
 three-sixteenths, dueled gamely with the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed on the wire under strong urging. SILVER SOIREE quickly sped
 clear, set the pace on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch, dueled gamely with the winner in the final furlong
 and was denied on the wire while clear for the place. TAPANY jostled with a rival at the start then dropped back, was reserved at the rear while racing with
 her head a bit high, came under urging while three then four wide on the turn, was put to the whip inside the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed kick
 while best of the rest. PELONCILLO chased the pace, raced inside on the turn, was put to the whip in upper stretch and tired. URBANE LEGEND jostled
 with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn and came up empty. PEARL OF THE NILE settled off the
 pace, saved ground while ridden along on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond. NINJA BOOBOO broke out at the start, was
 urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

 Footnotes
 DUDE GREELEY was urged along off the pace, raced inside into the turn then shifted to the two path, moved to the three path later on that bend, rallied into
 upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong handling. TYLERS BANDIT was forced in after the
 start, saved ground at the rear of the field, spun into the stretch in the two path, moved out more at the three-sixteenths and finished with good energy for
 the place. RUN TO FAME tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the two to three path on the turn, inched clear when
 asked for his best in upper stretch, was collared outside the sixteenth-pole then weakened but was well clear for the show. TIZ THE BLUES bumped with a
 rival at the start and was carried in, raced off the pace under urging, went three to four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. A HIGHER
 WAGER was urged along on the outside, chased in the three to four path on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong then tired.
 KZIXON VENGEANCE brushed the inside of the gate at the start but broke in front, set the pace under some pressure, vied along the rail on the turn, lost
 the lead near the quarter-pole and gave way. BRAVE AARON bumped with a foe at the start and was carried in, raced near the back under urging, went
 three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CHURCH OF ENGLAND chased the pace, dropped back some leaving the
 backstretch, raced near the inside on the turn and came up empty. MIGHTY T tossed his head at the start, was ridden along towards the rear, went six wide
 on the turn, came eight wide into the stretch and was no factor. AMBER'S FRIEND was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to
 respond. GRAND ASSEMBLY bumped with a rival at the start, dropped back while urged along, went five wide on the turn, was carried seven wide into the
 stretch and failed to respond.
