 Footnotes
 TWENTY GAUGE dueled on the inside, dug in gamely to prevail on the wire. COMPULSIVE battled winner to deep start, out-gamed to the wire, best of rest.
 NORTHERN EMPIRE shuffled back after the start, moved up in the stretch too late. STEALIN' SUMMER raced evenly throughout, four wide into stretch.
 RALLY WITH CLASS chased leaders three wide to stretch, faltered in the late going. OATHKEEPER saved ground to no avail. THIRST QUENCHER never
 a menace.

 match for winner. SOLO DRINK raced evenly throughout with no late kick when needed. RUSSIAN TO TAPIT chased pace to the half, began to tire and
 faded back. AULD CUP raced evenly with no late response. KING BING HAWK troubled start and first turn with a steady fade. RIGOLETTO never a
 menace.

 sat behind rivals to the top of stretch, squeezed through between APPLESLASTCHANCE and ADORABLE EYES when passing the three-sixteenths pole
 before making fast late charge. DAYIN DEAUVILLE set the pace along the rail, was headed inside the eighth pole and gave way. ADORABLE EYES
 chased inside, angled three wide into the stretch, bumped with PRIZE ARCH at the three-sixteenths pole and was even late. APPLESLASTCHANCE
 hopped start, made a three to four wide gain to challenge around far turn, bumped with PRIZE ARCH at the three-sixteenths pole then tired. SWEET ROCK

 UNEXPECTED VISIT pinched at the start, rushed to contend, rallied with a five wide run past the quarter pole and prevailed in a long drive. ROBOTRON
 raced inside most of way, rallied in the drive to just miss on the wire. CAROLINA REAPER good position to far turn, clear sailing into stretch but was
 outfinished through the late going. ZEMO dueled to the half, edged clear on the far turn and faltered in the drive. LOVE TOTEM dueled on the lead to the
 half but gave way into the stretch. MARGARITA MAYBE had a troubled start and failed to contend.

 Footnotes
 JUST BE FRANK went up inside to vie inside to turn, roused to draw off late. TWO SHAKES unhurried to the turn inside, split horses into stretch while no
 match in the final furlong, well clear of the rest. STARSHIP MERCURY had a tardy start, trailed to the stretch, angled widest past the quarter pole and
 moved up in the final furlong. OL' L B speed three wide to the turn but came up empty and weakened in the drive. PLAY BALL broke sharp from outside but
 could not keep up and went evenly. FLAT OUT PRIZE dueled briefly to the turn and weakened from inside in the drive. RUNFORTHEWOODS never a
 serious threat.
