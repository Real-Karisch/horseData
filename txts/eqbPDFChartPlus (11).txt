 WESTERN WILKO away in good order then was allowed to settle off the pace, moved closer, swung out into the stretch and ran down the leader
 midstretch. SCREAMIN SUE came together with AVA'S ANGEL away from the gate, vied outside, contested the pace approaching the quarter pole then
 was rundown midstretch and was best of the rest. VOODOO VIXEN broke outward, vied for the lead, led through the backstretch, lacked a response when
 met with a challenge from SCREAMIN' SUE and faded. ARCTIC TREASURE was jostled away and lacked a bid. AVA'S ANGEL was brushed leaving the
 gate, lost ground in the first turn and tired.

 Footnotes
 THISISMYSTORY quickly went to the front, drew clear through the turn and finished under a brisk hand ride. RISING RIVER SONG raced in closest pursuit,
 was roused in the final turn with no closing response and was no match for the winner. KELVINATOR lacked early speed and made a late run outside
 getting up in time for show. ALBERTA CHROM chased the pace and flattened. GO JAMES lacked a serious bid. BIG KAZ lacked early speed, chased
 through the backstretch, moved up menacingly and flattened in the final turn.

 Footnotes
 LIL LOTTIE sprinted to a long lead, was under steady urging at the top of the stretch, dug in and held under a long drive. COOL JEWEL was outsprinted to
 the turn, stalked outside, was asked for run in the far turn, moved up closer and surged late missing. HURRICANE PATTI tracked from inside, commenced
 a bid through the turn and lacked the final kick needed. VIVACISSIMA was hurried away, chased the leaders three-wide and failed to gain late. GAYSHAN
 lagged early, started to show interest leaving the backstretch along the rail but failed to threaten in the drive. LARAWYN was void of early speed and did not
 reach contention. SASSY MISS raced wide in the first turn and was eased.

 STELLA ELLA OLA saved ground along the rail, shifted three-wide at the three eighths pole, drew clear and was kept to task to win handily. MY THREE
 ANGELS was unhurried away then was in tight in the first turn, settled midpack, moved up closer, raced three-wide in the far turn and went in pursuit of the
 leader but was not good enough. TOCCALOT was away in good order, contended the pace from a rail position, was overtaken at the five sixteenth pole and
 lacked a closing response. SAFARI TAN pressed from outside and was roused to no avail. IMAGE OF MYSELF raced three-wide leaving the first turn and
 was not a factor. FAST FORWARD GAL was reserved off the pacesetters and was done early. PROFESSIONAL CRUSH was checked in the first turn and
 never reached contention. JOCKEY OBJECTION- an objection was lodged by the rider of MY THREE ANGELS against the rider of STELLA ELLA OLA
 alleging interference in the first turn was not allowed, no change.

 Footnotes
 WILKO'S FLYING BY showed good outside speed, contested the pace, drew away through the turn and was never asked. WILKO'S COMICSTRIP showed
 good inside speed, sat in striking position, rallied along the rail after the quarter pole, was roused sharply and gave best late but was outmatched. LADY
 CHARDONNAY raced three-wide leaving the first turn, rallied three-wide in the turn but lacked the rally needed. LULU'S BEST raced three-wide and
 showed some interest late. COMPLETE GO was bumped leaving the gate, advanced quickly along the rail but was unable to sustain the bid that was
 needed. CUPID'S WINGS vied along the rail, was overtaken and continued on with a gradual fade. GLITTERINMYEYE flashed early speed and tired.
 ROYAL SMOKE never reached contention. MERMAID MOON broke outward bumping COMPLETE GO, raced wide in the first turn and was eased.

 ZIPPITY ZAP rated off the pace, shifted off the rail at the head of the stretch, drifted in and won going away under light handling. ZAP TOWN was quickest
 to the turn, set a pressured pace, edged away at the quarter pole and was outkicked. TEEPLAY pressed the pace, was unable to match strides with ZAP
 TOWN and came up empty in the drive. MIZER MIKE raced wide in the first turn, lacked running room along the rail, swung out and showed some late
 interest. KEVIN E was allowed to settle, was roused at the quarter pole but failed to menace. DEMONS THUNDER drifted out in the first turn and was not a
 factor. CELTIC ASSASSIN was never far back and stopped.

 MIDST OF CHAOS saved ground from the rail, shifted off the rail then went in pursuit of the leader at the quarter pole and held sway. MAPLE LEAF RAG
 was slow to stride, advanced quickly from a rail position, waited for running room, was set down midstretch but could not stall the winner. BIG ERNIE raced
 four-five wide in the first turn, circled the field and closed determinedly. BRADWELL was under a snug hold through the first turn, rallied five to six-wide into
 the stretch and was bested late for show. DAWSON DUDE trailed early and closed well between rivals. N. Y. SMOKE settled midpack in the three path,
 raced through traffic at the head of the stretch but failed to threaten. FAST ALY was sent for speed outside, overtook the lead approaching the quarter pole
 and flattened out. B. R. ROCKET flashed early speed inside, was overtaken and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. SPEEDO CAT failed to menace.
 SWIFT ARROW broke alertly, chased the leaders and tired.
