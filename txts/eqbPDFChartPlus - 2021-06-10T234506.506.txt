 early, moved wide in the stretch and lacked a rally. POINT LOCKOUT dropped well behind and angled inside through the stretch while outrun. OURO

 Footnotes
 FORT APACHE hustled to the front, widened after the quarter, maintained a long advantage while kept to a strong drive. NONNO PIETRO bid three wide on
 the final turn, split rivals in the stretch to gain the place. ROYAL MELBOURNE moved off the pace between foes, bid inside in the stretch and finished
 willingly. WHEELBARRELBROTHRS pursued the winner near the inside and flattened out in the stretch. ALL THE GEORGES chased off the leader three
 wide and proved empty in the stretch. RAVAGE saved ground and weakened steadily. DE PUNTA A PUNTA dropped back along the rail and was never a
 factor. KING VICTORIA trailed throughout losing contact with his field.

 CHASING MY HALO, in the three path and just off the pace, joined command near mid stretch, began to edge away slightly deep stretch and then just
 lasted. STRONG BREEZE vied for command three wide, fell back slightly in deep stretch but then was coming back. CANIFORM, bumped leaving the gate,
 was outrun to stretch, raced wide and wasn't a serious threat. SWELL saved ground, bid on the turn but then flattened out. TRADFEST vied for command
 just off the rail, drifted out leaving the turn and tired. CAPT. GRIDER failed to menace. STRAWBERRY RED, two wide on the turn, failed to menace.
 CARDCOUNTER came in and bumped CANIFORM leaving the gate, dueled between foes then had little left. FOREST RIVER was well placed while
 outside winner then tired. BUZZKILLINGTON, very wide, had only brief speed. WARCRAFT, WHO WAS FRACTIOUS IN THE GATE, APPEARED TO BE
 IN THE GRASP OF AN ASSISTANT STARTER WHEN THE GATES OPENED AND HE BROKE FAR BEHIND THE FIELD. THE STEWARDS LITE THE
 INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW, THEY DECLARED WARCRAFT A NON-STARTER. A CONSULATION DAILY DOUBLE WAS PAID. ALL OTHER

 Footnotes
 MS LOCUST POINT quickly took control, widened in hand and was never threatened while under a strong hand ride. GOODONEHONEY pursued the
 winner along the inside and continued determinedly while to match for the winner. ZIPPER'S HERO drifted out in the opening furlong, had her heels slipped,
 was in tight briefly, recovered and continued willingly. SAINT MAIN EVENT clipped heels in the opening furlong. dropped back and was no factor.
 RISQUE'S DIAMOND stumbled at the start, forced the pace and gave way after three furlongs. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the fourth
 finisher against the third finisher, ZIPPER'S HERO was disqualified and placed fourth for interference in the opening furlong.

 Footnotes
 WATCH YOUR WORDS dueled inside, fell back after a quarter mile, moved to the outside rallying again, took the lead and drew off while drifting wider.
 EASTERN FRONT broke slowly, saved ground while never far back and was gaining late. VOCAB bobbled after breaking slowly, was hustled up between
 foes and held on well. CORSARIO, in the four path while just off the pace, tired. DOWN WITH THE KING vied outside winner, shook loose after a quarter
 mile but then had little left. DADDY'S THIEF, wide and just off the pace, was finished after a half. HOUSE OF FRIENDS, in the six path, showed little. ARMY
 MAN, very wide, dropped back steadily. HOWBOUTDEMPATS showed little.
