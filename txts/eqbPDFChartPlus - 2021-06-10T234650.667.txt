 WINNING SHOT broke slowly then was unhurried, made a strong three wide run in hand around the final turn and drew off under incessant whip. JOHNNY
 JUMP UP moved three wide to a short lead just before a quarter, moved two wide to a clear lead midway on the final turn but was little match. SUPER
 FUND showed speed in the two path into the far turn then tired. KING J was caught wide around the first turn, remained prominent outside into the far turn
 then stopped. SHEIKINATOR stopped inside.
