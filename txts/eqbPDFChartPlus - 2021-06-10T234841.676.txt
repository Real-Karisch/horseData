 Footnotes
 THE TIZZLER set a clear early pace, opened up through the turn, was never challenged and finished as an easy winner. FRIED PICKLES chased the early
 pace, went five wide into the turn, was no match for the winner and finished second best. VELOCITA stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the
 turn, drifted out in late stretch and was empty in the drive. ENTITLED STAR was not far back early, went six wide into the turn and faded in the drive. ICE
 COLD was unhurried early, raced between rivals into the turn, angled out in mid stretch and offered no late rally. SEASIDE FANTASY was always outrun.
