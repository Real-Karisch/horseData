 Footnotes
 MAJORIE MUGS was pinched back at the start then settled well back on the outside, eased out to mid-track moving into the backstretch and moved up
 without encouragement then started a bid near the three-eighths pole, steadily improved through the turn in the six path, then drove determinedly down the
 lane, passing rivals and gaining, to take the lead in later yards. CRAFTY MAUDE stalked the pace on the outside and drew to even terms at the
 seven-sixteenths pole, dueled through the backstretch and took the lead at the three-eighths pole, drew clear near the quarter pole and rounded the turn in
 the three path, saved ground leaving the turn, then dug in gamely but was caught in later yards. GIRLZILLA came in at the start then settled close off the
 pace on the outside, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the four path, then raced down the stretch and finished well. WE GOT
 GOLD rushed up and angled in to rate the pace inside, was met at even terms at the seven-sixteenths pole, dueled through the backstretch and was caught
 at the three-eighths pole, dropped back through the turn on the rail, then flattened in the stretch. IT'S SUGAR NOTSAND came out at the start and was
 jostled between Lilton Miss Tilton and Grand Offer at the three-quarter pole where the rider lost his left iron as a result, then settled well back on the outside,
 made a bid approaching the three-eighths pole, took the far turn in the five path, then gained down the lane and finished well. LILTON MISS TILTON was
 bumped at the three-quarter pole by It's Sugar Notsand then swung out into the first turn and settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the
 three-eighths pole and moved to the inside, rounded the far turn on the rail, then finished evenly. MAE'S MAGIC saved ground in the first turn and settled
 well off the pace on the inside, eased to the outside moving into the backstretch, made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the six
 path, then passed tired rivals down the stretch. JUDY JUMP IN came out at the start, then was never a factor. GRAND OFFER was squeezed at the start
 then bumped at the three-quarter pole by Its Sugar Notsand, settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole, angled in to round
 the turn on the rail, then faded in the stretch. FRONT ROW CENTER was through before the half. The stewards posted an inquiry and made no changes.

 through the turn and held on well with steady stretch encouragement. OUR CARLY rated close two deep while between horses, challenged at even terms

 leaving the gate, rated close four wide, bid approaching the quarter pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and was outfinished for second in a stretch
 long duel. FRANCESCA DI FIORI, off the pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and passed some tiring rivals. JOKERS TOTHE

 rounding the far turn. JUSTGIMMEAKISS stumbled at the break, rated close three wide, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded
 rounding the far turn.

 HE'S ROYAL pressured the pace from the outside and took the lead at the nine-sixteenths pole, dueled through the backstretch, drew clear midway through
 the far turn in the three path, then widened down the stretch and held on well. CREATIVE MIST battled to the front to rate a pressured pace inside, was
 caught at the nine-sixteenths pole and dueled through the backstretch, then dropped back mid-turn on the rail and raced down the stretch, but leveled off
 slightly in the final sixteenth. CASHTON PEAK settled well back on the inside and made a bid at the five-sixteenths pole, started the far turn on the rail but
 moved to the outside midway through the turn and steadily improved in the five path, then came up between horses in the final sixteenth and just lasted for
 third. ONTHESTRAITANARROW settled off the pace inside and made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole, moved to the outside at the five-sixteenths,
 rounded the far turn in the five path, moved further out at the head of the lane and finished widest, just missing third. LINDY'S PAL was never a threat. HOT
 MIC rated off the pace on the outside, began dropping back past the five-sixteenths pole and faded in the stretch. WILLISVILLE was shuffled back at the
 start and was never a factor.

 LIES AND SCANDALS bobbled after the start but took an immediate lead to rate the pace inside, was met at even terms nearing the half mile pole,
 contested at a close disadvantage from the seven sixteenths, recovered the top spot midway on the far turn, raced clear toward the head of the lane and
 held on under steady encouragement. CHARITABLE HEART rated off the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
 the far turn five and six wide, dug in at the top of the stretch and finished well to take place later yards. INNER STRENGTH settled back saving ground the
 opening turn, eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, raced five wide on the far turn, swung to the outside leaving the turn and
 was along for third later yards. STARLIGHT FLIGHT stalked the early pace two deep, challenged at even terms approaching the half mile pole, contested
 with a slim advantage from the seven sixteenths but was headed midway on the far turn, dropped back toward the top of the lane and faded the final
 sixteenth. GROOMED TO ROCK, off the pace inside the first turn, showed mild response through the backstretch, eased out entering the stretch, lacked
 room in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole then leveled off toward the wire. ATTEMPTING TO LOVE rated close inside the first turn, bid nearing the three
 eighths pole, had aim three wide on the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth.

 Footnotes
 IT'S FLASHY tapered in through the front stretch to stalk the pace two deep, moved to even terms nearing the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead toward
 the three eighths, raced clear into the far turn and widened under steady handling. FRANKIE DOTS, off the early pace about the three path, eased out
 entering the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide then lugged inward through the stretch while dueling for second
 the final sixteenth. WHISPERING BILL rated close four wide the opening turn, raced toward the outside entering the backstretch, steadied approaching the
 quarter pole, rounded the far turn seven wide and was along for third later yards. ERDENET surged clear toward the three quarter pole to rate the pace
 inside, was pressured leaving the seven sixteenths, dropped back and gave chase nearing the three eighths, had his heels clipped past the five sixteenths
 pole, rounded the far turn four wide then leveled out down the lane. CHATTER PATTERN rated close to the pace two deep while between horses the first
 turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail but showed little further through the lane. HACKSAW steadied nearest
 the rail off the heels of Dear Old Dad past the five eighths pole, eased out leaving the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, checked at the inside
 flank of Whispering Bill while just outside of Dear Old Dad approaching the quarter, rounded the far turn at the rail and had little further down the lane.
 FO'C'SLE broke in to make contact with Dear Old Dad, rounded the first turn about the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed little
 response. DEAR OLD DAD rated off the pace inside the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths, fell over the fallen Captain Holiday past the five
 sixteenths pole but got up and walked off. CAPTAIN HOLIDAY came away a step slow and was bumped, rated close inside the first turn, closed to and
 clipped the heels of Erdenet then fell past the five sixteenths pole but got up and walked off. An inquiry took place regarding the incident past the five
 sixteenths pole but no changes were necessary.
