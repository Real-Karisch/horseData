 Footnotes
 DIXIE DOO RUN RUN stalked from off the rail, two wide into the turn, bid outside the leader and gained the lead in the upper-stretch, cleared that rival then
 held safely under left-handed urging. BOB AGAIN tracked from the inside, angled out off the rail on the turn, closed but could not get by the winner.
 STREET PUNK set the pace and angled over to the inside, led clear around the turn then received pressure into the stretch, overtaken in the lane and tired.
 INDEPENDENCE CREED showed no early speed, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

 Footnotes
 WHATAHANDSOMECAT sped to the front, dueled outside of REAL QUICK into and around the turn, cleared leaving the bend, led through the drive,
 weakened a bit late but held on. MORTON GLORY three deep briefly then chased from the outside to the lane, surged late but was denied at the wire. MR
 BINGLEY raced off the rail, two wide on the turn, shifted around foe who checked, angled to the inside in the stretch, rallied and finished a game third.
 SIERRA ECHO bumped at the start, stalked from the inside, angled out entering the stretch and could not rally. REAL QUICK bumped leaving the gate, sent
 up the inside and dueled for the lead, was in tight and checked on the turn and faded in the lane. The rider aboard REAL QUICK lobbed an objection
 against the winner WHATAHANDSOMECAT alleging interference on the turn. After a review, the Stewards ruled the video was inconclusive and ruled there
 would be no change.
