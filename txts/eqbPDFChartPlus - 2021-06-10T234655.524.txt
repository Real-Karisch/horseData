 CHEERS AND PRAYERS vied inside, bumped entering the turn, inched away, was under pressure through the drive and held on gamely. SUPER SWISS
 stalked the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail leaving the turn, lacked room in the upper stretch and went willingly to the wire. HIS WAY was never
 far back, bid inside, was blocked and altered course near the eighth pole and closed once clear to earn show. CAST AND BLAST was jostled at the start,
 raced close to the pace and lacked the needed late response. BEACH MODE dueled between horses, bumped entering the turn, fell back and hung late.
 MAX THE KITTY stumbled at the start to be off slowly and failed to menace in an even effort. RUNN'N REBEL pressed the pace three across to the turn,
 weakened and faded through the stretch. The rider of SUPER SWISS lodged an objection against the rider of CHEERS AND PRAYERS for alleged
 interference in the stretch. No change was made.
