 Footnotes
 DOUBLE STAR stalked the early pace from the inside, reached a forward position entering the turn, altered outside for the drive, responded and was just up
 the final stride. KEEP THE COMMISH dueled from the outside early, battled through the turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole but could not last.
 TRISTAN'S DREAM forced the early pace from the outside, remained in a forward position for the drive, responded but was outfinished for the place.
 LITTLE RED KID could only improve position. THEBOYZDELIGHT dueled from the inside and tired. SILIS was never close. YOURS ALONE was never a
 threat.
