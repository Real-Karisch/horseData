 Footnotes
 HIDDEN CROOK dueled from the outside to the turn, cleared foe and drew off to the lane, continued well clear of the field and was geared down late.
 NORTH RUN settled off the pace, saved ground to the stretch, rallied along the inside and gained second. THE TATTOO KID dueled from the inside, lost
 ground and chased two wide to the stretch and weakened. CHIQUILIN stalked from the inside up the backstretch, angled out into the lane but failed to rally.
 IMPEACHMENT ACE stumbled badly leaving the gate, raced off the rail, three to four wide around the turn and never rallied. LIZZIE'S LUCKY LAD broke in
 at the start, trailed from off the rail, two wide around the turn and proved no menace. GO NELI GO saved ground along the rail and didn't offer any response
 in the stretch. Due to a timer malfunction, the first race was hand-timed.

 CONFIRMED stalked the pace outside of a rival, bid outside the leader on the turn, kicked clear of that foe and drew away. FANDAREL DANCER stumbled
 at the start, raced a bit off the rail, angled out further, rallied and split foes in the stretch to earn the place. DREAMIN' OF BLAZE stalked from the inside up
 the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch, went evenly through the final furlong and lost the place. ZACHIAN set the pace off the rail, challenged and lost
 the lead around the turn while two to three wide, then weakened in the late stages. HOUDINI'S MAGIC showed no early speed, saved ground into the
 stretch and could not rally. ON THE FENCE tracked off the rail, three wide around the turn and weakened. Due to a timer malfunction, the second race was
 hand-timed.
