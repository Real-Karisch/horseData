 Footnotes
 SOCIAL FAN hustled from the gate, cut the pace through solid splits along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, came under threat
 a furlong out briefly before his main danger lugged in, then edged away under a drive kept to task. WRATH four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
 three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. CHATTEL coaxed from the gate, chased three wide from
 just off the pace, came in slightly bumping with FIX ME A SANDWICH lightly at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, seemed poised to
 pounce on the leader but lugged in at the three-sixteenths briefly threatening for the front before lugging in once more a furlong out and then twice more
 inside that station to the sixteenth marker, kept on for the show honors despite battling the rider to the finish seemingly intent on kissing the rail through the
 final seventy yards. FLAT RATE coaxed along chasing inside, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. FIX ME A SANDWICH
 hustled from the start, chased just off the inside in range of the leader, came briefly between foes loosely and was bumped three furlongs out as CHATTEL
 came in slightly, got shaken off near the quarter pole, swung three wide at that station and weakened in the stretch. HERBIES TOYS broke awkwardly at the
 start conceding two lengths to the front and taking over the lane of WAYNES FOOTSTEPS forcing his barnmate to steady, chased along the inside under
 coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. WAYNES FOOTSTEPS hit the near side stall at the
 start, then was forced to steady in behind his barnmate as that one broke awkwardly and conceded four lengths to the front, chased along the inside under
 coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 BLISSFUL BREEZE away forwardly placed, retained its position, stalked the pacesetter from the two path and would continue to shadow the runner up for
 over three-quarters, stepped into the stretch, was given its cue after arriving at the three-sixteenths pole, chiseled away at the deficit as the first two finishers
 went at it in a one on once contest, was determined to the end and won the bob. REGAL DAME out-broke the field, showed the way, setting the first three
 fractions getting rated, was put to a drive heading home, got engaged in a stirring tussle with the top one soon afterwards, showed no quit, but lost the bob.
 LA PIU BELLA got set up in the pocket shortly after the field had been sent on its way, was patiently ridden keeping watch on the front runners, remained on
 hold wedged in along the rail during the final stages of the run around the second bend, had enough room to inch her way into path two at the top of the
 lane, paused in hand then shifted to be outside the top twosome in midstretch, failed to muster up any headway. SIMONA strung out three wide on both
 turns, had no rally. GIANT BOXER began its journey on the clubhouse bend primarily in path four, completed it working out a tuck into the two path, sat
 reserved chasing the pace, was under a drive commencing the stretch slightly wider, failed to fire appreciably.

 HYNDFORD four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing half a mile from home, continued three wide into upper stretch, took over command with

 sensible splits, came under coaxing five-sixteenths out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under growing threat to the outside, got headed near the
 three-sixteenths, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. INFIELD IS IN six then five wide in pursuit
 down the backstretch, chased four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and kept on for the
 show honors. AMERICAN POWER chased four then three wide under encouragement from midway on the turn, cornered three to four wide into upper
 stretch and weakened in the drive. LUTHERAN RAGS three then two wide in range of the leader, came under a ride at the three-eighths, swung four to five
 wide at the quarter pole and tired. SWEEPING VISTA chased two to three wide under motivation from the seven-sixteenths, went three then two wide at the

 Footnotes
 HOPONTHEBUSGUS away without apparent mishap, was strung out three wide on the chute, tucked into path two after entering the backstretch and
 remained stationed there until the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, tipped back into path three in preparation for the stretch drive, responded when
 given her cue spinning into the lane and charged to the front, remained comfortably in the clear, under a hand drive crossing the finish line. MIKO rode the
 rail for the opening six furlongs, at times with the pilot applying a snug hold on the reins, picked up interest swinging to the outside prior to entering the
 stretch, slithered her way into path four by the three-sixteenths pole, but didn't stay put, and instead shifting a path closer to the rail, bumping shoulder to
 shoulder with B THREE before completing the change of course, dueled with HARDLY MATE for place honors thereafter and came up the victor. HARDLY
 MATE raced sluggishly, bringing up the back of the pack on the chute, got set up in the two path taking up the chase, was asked for more angling to the
 outside for the drive home, wound up five wide when done, sparred with MIKO in the final furlong for second and fell short of snagging that award. B THREE
 stalked the front runners from path two, was called upon turning into the lane, towards the three path, was bumped into by the winner in midstretch, shied in
 a bit right afterwards, resulting in itself and two others to the inside exchanging some contact with each other, never regained any interest securing the last
 major check. LION IN WAIT tracked the action towards the inside route, was forced to idle along, stuck in traffic beginning from the general area of the
 five-sixteenths marker, spun into the stretch, still lacking room to launch a rally, steadied briefly after the conclusion of the bumping incident with under an
 eighth to go, tipped to the outside and finished the rest of the trip to the wire, basically having had no shot of ever getting asked for its best. EDISTO
 ISLAND vied for control from along the rail, was engaged with pair of opponents to the outside when displaced by the eventual winner in midstretch, traded
 several bumps with MISTRESS OFFTHEDARK, by this time though no longer figuring as a prominent factor, and faltered. MISTRESS OFTHEDARK
 remained well off the rail after springing from the gate, appeared headstrong rushing up four wide to the top, held it for only a few jumps before being
 replaced by a rail-higging EDISTO ISLAND, prompted that foe two to three wide on the far turn, going about in a more professional manner, got roused
 issuing a challenge from the head of the stretch until deep into the furlong grounds, proved no match once the winner arrived on the scene, was in the first
 stages of backing away, when squeezed a short distance beyond the eighth pole, then did indeed back away.

 ANDESINE broke out at the start bumping STORMY'S SONG twice before being corrected, angled to the four path shortly after the start and chased four
 then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, took over command nearing the quarter pole and swung three to four
 wide at that station, dug in under a near sided stick shying out a furlong from home and a sixteenth out all while edging clear to the wire kept to task.
 STORMY'S SONG bumped twice at the start by the aforementioned foe who broke outwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
 five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on through the stretch knocking heads with POSSE NEEDED through to the finish chasing the
 winner home and just got the bob on the wire for the place honors. POSSE NEEDED five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide at the
 nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing half a mile out, angled six wide into upper stretch, chased the winner home hooked up in a duel through the final
 furlong with the aforementioned rival but lost the nod at the finish while clear for the show honors. BOW TOWN CAT established the front from the get go
 and came under challenge to the inside from EVERYBODY LOVES ME, dueled three then two wide with that rival to his inside through the turn under urging
 from the three-eighths, got overtaken in tandem nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the stretch. EVERYBODY
 LOVES ME ranged up shortly after the start to duel to the inside of BOW TOWN CAT from the two path, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under a
 ride near the five-sixteenths, succumbed the front in tandem with his main pace rival nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 SURGING TIDE took up position in path two after the break, sat reserved for nearly three-quarters pole, picked up interest when asked tipping to the outside
 coming up to the quarter pole, spun five wide into the stretch and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, out-fought them to begin the final furlong as the
 new leader and drew off. PRESUMPTUOUS remained along the inside after the field had been sent off and running, got eased to the outside right around
 the five-sixteenths marker, was put to a drive a sixteenth down the road heading home, got squeezed after getting wedged in between rivals as
 FINGERPAINT was herself abandoning the pocket, bumped soundly with FIDUCIARY VALUES, got going again soon afterwards and rallied for the place.
 HOT CASH chased the pace from the two path, bid from between rivals turning for home, worked its way to a slim advantage, got overhauled by the winner
 soon afterwards and weakened into the show slot. FIDUCIARY VALUES pursued the front runners from path four, bumped hard with the second place
 finisher settling into upper stretch, had no rally. GOLDEN AWARD darted over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, took it during the
 run around the bend, got roused getting sent to the outside coming up to the top of the lane, mustered up a seven wide rally for a minor slice. OOZLE off the
 inside throughout, departed the backstretch from path three, picked it up as six furlongs was being reached, put up a challenge from the end of the bend
 until the furlong grounds, failed to cement itself to the front and backed away. FINGERPAINT kept an eye on the front runners from the pocket, began to slip
 to the outside after stepping into the lane, wound up sandwiching the runner up in addition to making some contact with that opponent, lacked a response.
 SANSIBAR JEWEL maintained control after breaking on top, cut the pace well ratted along the inside route, gave in when pounced upon as the third fraction
 was being finalized and retreated. Following a claim of foul lodged by the rider of PRESUMPTUOUS against the rider of SURGING TIDE alleging
 interference, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

 COMPAGNO away well, was allowed to settle three wide in the clear at the tail of the field early on, tucked to the two path six furlongs from home, was
 patiently handled tucked to the inside through the turn, spun just off the inside for home in behind the leader, angled to the inside and scraped the paint
 inside SUPER DUDE squeezing through a narrow seam to poke a nose in front a furlong from home, then edged clear under a drive kept busy to the wire.
 SUPER DUDE broke in at the start under coaxing, established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing three furlongs
 from home under some pressure for the initial time, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat, dug in rebuffing the challenge from
 BENEFACTOR to the outside when headed for command a furlong from home as the aforementioned foe threaded his way through the narrow seam to the
 inside, couldn't match that rival late on while running on clear for the place honors. DADDY'S HOME saved ground in reserve near the rear, came under
 coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. BENEFACTOR attended the pace of SUPER DUDE from
 the two path, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and bid to issue a challenge swinging three wide at that station, got rebuffed a furlong from home
 and weakened through to the finish. GORSE tracked the pace from the two path, came under coaxing two to three wide at the three-eighths, angled four to
 five wide into upper stretch and tired.

 head down in front approaching the quarter pole, kicked away from a drifting ZANOTTI while drifting to outside itself down the lane. ZANOTTI hung out four
 wide on each bend, moved together with the top one towards the pacesetter on turn two, went by as did the winner, swung into the lane rubbing shoulders
 with HARD STUDY, drifted out failing to keep pace thereafter, but held on well enough to salvage second. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON kept watch loosely
 pocketed, angled three wide into the lane, mustered up a mild response to take the show. CARLINO worked out a tuck early on the first turn, continued
 along the inside route before getting called upon angling to the outside leaving the three-eighths pole, commenced the stretch three wide, made no impact.
 HARLAN PUNCH shook off light contact with SCUBA to take the lead, sailed along in path two on an open lead during the initial stages, came under
 pressure from TURCO BRAVO after making it onto the backstretch, turned back the challenger but gained no respite, with the first finishers now closing in,
 gave in to those fresher challengers a bit shy of the quarter pole and faltered. TURCO BRAVO (CHI) strung out three wide, quickened to unleash an
 abbreviated bid after the first fraction had been set, was flicked off by the pacesetter, but after a few more strides, took another shot at the leader, this being
 hand urged, kept up the bid until the midway point on the far turn and gave way. SCUBA brushed with HARLAN PUNCH as they left the starting gate, got
 guided into the three path, took it around both the first and second turns, was asked to pick it coming up to the quarter pole, got driven into path six,
 straightened away and came up empty.

 Footnotes
 HOLDING ACES broke out at the start bumping CURTIS, chased three wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing midway on the turn, swung four
 wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, inched away briefly before coming under late threat, dug in and held on to prevail.
 TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch,
 rallied to threaten surging late but missed at the finish while clear for the place honors. FRATELLO DEL NORD lost his footing at the start and came under
 hustling to chase in closest aim of the leader just off the inside, came under urging three furlongs from home, swung three wide at the head of the stretch,
 kept on for the show honors. CURTIS bumped at the start by HOLDING ACES who broke outwards, showed the way in hand along the inside under some
 pressure from FRATTELLO DEL NORD to the outside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, shook away briefly before coming under threat and was
 headed a furlong from home, then weakened in the late stages. HEAVEN'S RUNWAY chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
 spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response. SET THE TRAPPE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
 swung two to three wide for home, made no impact. CHOSEN ONE ELIJAH hustled from the gate, chased four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths,
