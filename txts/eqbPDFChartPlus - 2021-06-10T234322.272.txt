 furlong and held second. I'MTHETAPITNOW set the a rated pace two wide, cleared entering the turn, continued on his left lead in the lane, led to
 midstretch, weakened and held third. RULE YOURSELF stalked the pace inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and came up empty. RIDE TO THE
 SUNSET raced wide and played no factor. RED CLAY ROAD had brief speed inside.

 Footnotes
 LOST IN LIMBO , four deep leaving the turn, advanced outside horses, was bumped by START WITH YES when that one was forced out near the eighth
 pole, edged clear and lugged in late. START WITH YES , two wide on the turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, advanced between
 horses to reach contention in upper stretch, bumped LOST IN LIMBO when bumped and forced out by BLESSED ARION near the eighth pole then was
 lightly steadied behind the winner approaching the finish. BLESSED ARION set a pressured pace three wide on the turn, angled to the two path entering the
 stretch then bumped START WITH YES when drifting out under left hand urging in mid stretch. OUTOFTHEPARK , three wide on the turn, was never a
 factor. AULD LANGE SYNE stumbled at the break, failed to be a factor and swung to the seven path in upper stretch. SLIPPIN JIMMY lunged at the break
 and was outrun. ROYAL KIBOSH saved ground on the turn, prompted the pace and weakened. KENILWORTH was not a factor. An objection by the rider of
 START WITH YES against LOST IN LIMBO for alleged interference in mid stretch was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the stretch
 run but no action was taken.

 BARBSGRAY LION settled off the early pace two wide, angled to the rail entering the turn, stayed at the rail to go through a large opening in upper stretch,
 rallied inside to take the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. UMIGHTBEANEMPRESS stumbled badly at the start, raced off the
 pace two wide, came three wide in upper stretch and rallied widest. IT'S A SHAW THING stalked the pace two wide in the clear, seized command in upper
 stretch, was collared near the sixteenth pole and faded to third. WILDCATTIN saved ground off the pace around the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch
 and finished evenly. HENINGHAM broke slowly, lagged well back and had a mild belated rally. AWESOME PARK sprinted clear soon after the start, set the
 pace along the rail, drifted into the lane and retreated.
