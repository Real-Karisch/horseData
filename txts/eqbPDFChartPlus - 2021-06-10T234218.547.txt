 Footnotes
 DA WINNER IS was unhurried early, advanced through the second quarter while being guided out four wide near the quarter-pole, caught CONCORDIA'S
 WAY in deep stretch and held off a late bid from SIR BOND. The latter hopped slightly at the start to get away slowest, saved ground trailing to the stretch,
 shifted to the far outside finding his best stride past the furlong marker and was closing in late. CONCORDIA'S WAY tucked in behind the early leaders,
 moved out three wide to take over at the top of the lane, pulled clear through the furlong grounds but weakened through the last sixteenth of a mile.
 WIZARD OF ODDS sped clear early inside, was collared after three furlongs and gave way. IS EVERYBODY HAPPY chased outside the early pacesetter,
 and was finished by the top of the stretch. WORLD VIEW raced two to three wide on the turn, and dropped back steadily through the stretch.

 Footnotes
 ACCOLADE was hard to load and restless once in the gate, entered the backstretch widest, advanced three wide and reached the front outside the
 quarter-pole, drew well clear in midstretch and was kept to pressure until 50 yards out. CSABAWABA vied inside ARNINA around the first turn, then outside
 DANGERUS HEARTED up the backstretch through ordinary fractions, was powerless to fend off ACCOLADE approaching the stretch, and ran on clear of
 the others. DOUBLE LUCK raced three wide at the back for six furlongs, and was along for third while never in the hunt. DANGERUS HEARTED went up to
 vie for command inside CSABAWABA after a quarter-mile, and was finished before reaching the stretch. ARNINA took an awkward first step while breaking
 alertly, vied outside CSABAWABA through most of the first quarter before backing off, and faltered after six furlongs.

 CAT GIUMARELLO led inside going to the first turn, deferred to MISS AJA BROWN and went around to stalk that one up the backstretch, rebid and easily
 regained command around the far turn, drove clear through the furlong grounds, and was in hand for the final sixteenth of a mile. ZAFIRO AZUL saved
 ground outrun for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and was along for the place. HOLIDAY PRAYER raced three wide around the turns, and was
 outfinished for the runner-up spot. MISS AJA BROWN broke outward, rushed up outside to take over from CAT GIUMARELLO around the first turn, moved
 inside rating along clear to the far turn, was overhauled in short order past the three-eighths, and retreated. LIKEAGIRL was three wide early, and always
 outrun.

 HIGH ROLLER hustled up after the start to take a short lead inside two pursuers, shook clear in upper stretch and widened under pressure. PAPACHO was
 outsprinted early, swung five wide getting in gear past the quarter-pole, and rallied outside for the place. SELF START broke slowly, trailed despite strong
 urging up the backstretch, advanced through upper stretch and was up outside EMMETT'S DREAM to snag the show near the wire. EMMETT'S DREAM
 was well placed saving ground behind the leading trio around the turn, rallied through midstretch, but could not sustain the bid and was outfinished for larger
 shares. GRINGO STAR raced four wide in range early, and tired in the stretch. RHETTBUTLER argued the pace between horses for three furlongs and
 faded steadily after that. SHOE LOVES SHOE forced the pace three wide and was finished entering the stretch.

 HEATHER HILLS pressed the pace outside SHANGHAI BONNIE from the start, wrested the lead away in upper stretch, and pulled clear under pressure.
 NELLYSFORD saved ground outsprinted for three furlongs, shifted to the two-path in the drive and rallied mildly for the place. VAMPISH ducked out at the
 start and was gathered up spotting several lengths, advanced four wide approaching the stretch, and was just up for the show outside. SHANGHAI BONNIE
 set the pace inside, could not hold off HEATHER HILLS soon after entering the stretch, and weakened on the rail through the final eighth of a mile. GIN N
 SPICE balked at loading, came away in good order with aim off the leaders three wide, but faded through the lane. LIVE LARGE trailed inside to the top of
 the lane, shifted out widest and made no headway. POLARIZATION went along two wide between horses into the turn, and never made an impact.

 Footnotes
 SHATTER ME set the pace pressed from the inside by EMO, shook that rival off in the three-path through midstretch and edged clear under a drive.
 SHANNA'S GRAY stayed in range saving ground to the stretch, and rallied mildly on the rail. EMO battled inside SHATTER ME to the stretch slightly off the
 inside, and drifted out steadily under left-hand pressure past the eighth-pole while weakening. TRULY RED took the turn three wide, shifted out widest in the
 lane and finished evenly. HUFFLEPUFF chased two wide early, moved out wider turning for home, and was forced out and impeded by EMO through deep
 stretch. KABIKEKA lacked speed inside and was no factor. PRINCESS JAVONCIA raced two wide and was through early. SUSI SOLE trailed three wide.
 FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF HUFFLEPUFF AGAINST EMO, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED
 FROM THIRD POSITION AND PLACED FIFTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. HUFFLEPUFF RACED FOR PURSE MONEY
 ONLY.

 HILLS POND stalked the leaders inside to the far turn, split GLAD MOON and QUALITY STEP taking over near the quarter-pole, drove clear through the
 furlong grounds while shifting back to the rail, and was geared down late. GLAD MOON (GER) hustled up along the rail after the start, rated along clear
 through a manageable pace for six furlongs, had no answer for HILLS POND turning for home, altered off the rail in midstretch and ran on clear of the
 remainder. SADLER BAY raced two wide early in the second flight, moved inside and went past spent rivals to pick up third. QUALITY STEP prompted the
 pace two wide for six furlongs, and retreated into the lane. PANAMA PAPERS stayed in range three wide early, dropped back to trail on the far turn, and
 was eased up through the late stages.

 CLEARLY SUPER dueled head and head for the lead outside C C'S WARRIOR from the opening bell, and gamely prevailed over that stubborn opponent
 after a long, hard drive. C C'S WARRIOR went at it with CLEARLY SUPER from the get-go, fought tenaciously through their race-long dispute and was
 narrowly beaten. TISDALE improved position in the two-path around the turn, had aim at the battling leaders through the lane but could not gain with an
 even finish. CIRCLE AWAY trailed two wide to the stretch, and improved past tired rivals. MATTER OF FACTOR faded through a ground-saving trip.
 WITCHY'S LASTSTAND raced three to four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed response. GET A VALENTINE was well placed tracking outside
 the leaders, but faltered after a half-mile.
