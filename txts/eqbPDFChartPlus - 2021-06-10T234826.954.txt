 Footnotes
 SPECIAL CAT chased the leaders from outside, advanced three to four wide on the turn, engaged the leader in upper stretch then edged away late under
 mild urging. RUNAWAY NONNY attended the pace from outside, obtained a brief and narrow lead at the top of the lane, was challenged by SPECIAL CAT
 and could not go on with that one while clear of the rest. FOXY BARBARA coaxed forward to set the pace inside, drifted out a bit leaving the turn then
 yielded. SHESA PROWLER tracked the leaders inside and went evenly. SHE'S CHARLITA lacked early speed, swung five wide into the stretch and
 improved mildly. STUNNER got away just a step slowly, moved forward to pursue from between rivals early, shifted in a bit on the turn then emptied out.

 JANIMAL bobbled just slightly at the break, saved ground into the stretch, made a bid up the rail late but just missed. OVERRIDE chased the early pace two
 to three wide, lost a bit of ground into the stretch, closed late to narrowly miss. OH MERCY ME tracked the leaders in behind, kicked on mildly but was too
 late. ONE QUICK BUDDY chased the pace three to four wide and lacked the needed late kick. ADIOS ODDS failed to make a bid racing off the inside. HE

 Footnotes
 CIRCUSTOWN FLYER settled last but one, came into the stretch four wide, drove to the lead about seventy yards out and cleared. CAMINETTO dueled
 outside a rival, put that one away and was clear into upper stretch but reeled in. LAYCOCK BAY pressed the pace three wide, lacked the needed late kick.
 SUPER ACCORD lacked early speed but improved position racing off the inside into the stretch. GRAND SLAM SAM tracked the early leaders on or near
 the inside but failed to rally. JUST METEOR dueled inside a rival, faded in the stretch and was vanned off.

 FIRE evenly. HIGH RATE OF MOTION light brush, no rally. BIG DADDYS WINNER lacked needed kick. LUMINATRE shifted in & out. U R MY QUEEN
 away well, light brush. BROWN TRES SEIS no bid.
