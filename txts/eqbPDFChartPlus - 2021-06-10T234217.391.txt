 Footnotes
 GEMAGILITY stalked three wide, bid outside rivals in upper stretch, dueled, gained a slim lead near the sixteenth marker and edged away a bit under a
 drive. EVAN'S CHILE was nudged clear early, secured the rail and set the pace around the turn, dug in when confronted by a pair of foes in upper stretch,
 dueled past the eighth pole and kept on gamely in a sharp debut. COURTESY SHUFFLE had speed towards the rail, steadied around the far turn, eased
 out mid turn, bid between rivals in upper stretch, fought on past the furlong grounds then faded very late. GAUZY broke slowly, regrouped and edged up off
 the rail nearing the turn, came three to four wide for the drive, raced on her left lead past the eighth pole and finished with decent energy. COLONEL JELLY
 ROLL saved ground chasing the pace and came up empty. CAPTURE THE LIGHT was outrun.

 Footnotes
 MERCILLA , fractious behind the starting gate, rated along the rail, eased off the fence leaving the backstretch, aggressively split horses near the three
 eighths pole, moved up inside rivals in upper stretch, angled out near the eighth pole, bid for the lead outside SOMETHING MAGICAL near the sixteenth
 pole and narrowly prevailed under brisk urging. SOMETHING MAGICAL , quickly clear, set the pace along the rail and gave way grudgingly. STEREO
 VIEWING (IRE) , steadied in traffic entering the far turn, circled the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied late. ADULT IN THE ROOM ,
 three wide chasing the pace, weakened the final furlong. COSMIC LOVE (GB) lost ground on the turns and failed to rally. LILO'S CALL chased the pace two
 wide and gave way.

 Footnotes
 ONCE MORE EH opened up early, set the pace under a light hold while saving ground, had the competition close in nearing the five sixteenths, responded
 when set down in upper stretch, kicked back away and proved much the best while kept to task. KUSTAAFU , three wide early, advanced outside a rival
 leaving the five sixteenths, gave hard chase from there but could not gain. ROCK RABBIT , off the pace, raced between foes leaving the far turn, angled
 four wide into the stretch and had a mild gain. SWEET BROTHER saved ground, took closer order under pressure past the three eighths, chased into the
 lane and gave way. SEVENTYSEVEN FORCE hopped at the break, saved ground off the pace, angled out nearing the lane and came up empty. ICE
 CREAM DUDE broke a step slow and was dull. SALUTELUTE was pulled up after sustaining an injury leaving the five eighths marker then was vanned off.

 PAPAL LAW disputed the pace outside REGAL IMAGE, gained a clear lead in mid stretch and lasted. SUE ME hugged the rail on the turns, eased out to
 the two path turning for home and rallied between horses. CHARGIN STORM stalked the pace two wide, eased out to the three path for the drive and
 gained late. POSITIVIST lacked speed, circled both turns three wide and gained late outside horses. REGAL IMAGE came in at the break, saved ground
 disputing the pace and tired the final furlong. SPEED GRACER , squeezed leaving the starting gate, was not a factor. AUTOSTRADE was outrun.
 BRUCARITA was outrun. TRICKED UP , three deep the far turn, was outrun. GHOST HUNTER hugged the inner rail, stalked the pace and faltered.

 HIGH ROLLER , between rivals into the turn, dropped in and moved up into the lane, swung out advancing past the three sixteenths, made a grinding run
 under strong handling, was floated out late and got up. COBH dueled between rivals, gained a short lead nearing mid stretch, wandered outward in the final
 sixteenth and kept on gamely. DO YAHWANNA SALSA , five wide early, shifted in with some run past the three sixteenths, steadied off the winner's heels,
 split rivals and finished willingly. ARMY GREY , off the pace, swung out in mid stretch and rallied. DR. CERRATO vied three deep and gave way through the
 final sixteenth. SOUND OFF failed to menace. TOOK OVER dueled inside a pair of foes, ceded the lead inside the three sixteenths and weakened.
 CARYSFORT REEF saved ground, was in tight leaving the far turn and dropped back.
