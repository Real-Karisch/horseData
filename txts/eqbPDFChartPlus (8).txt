 Footnotes
 LOCAL LEGACY Broke slow, gained along the rail on the turn, eased out into the lane for room, reached the leaders three across a furlong and under a
 hand ride proved best. IL VAGABONDO Stumbled at the start, gained along the two path on the turn to challenge from between at the top of the lane,
 battled in that position leaving the furlong marker and finished willingly. BRASSTOWN SHERIFF Was well placed along the two path, angled out in the lane
 and finished with interest. CALHOUN HILL Four wide up the backstretch, two path around the turn and made a mild bid. SOUTHERN PROPER Away well,
 set the pace along the rail, was hooked on the turn, battled inside and weakened. STOPTHEFEVER Tracked along the three path, moved to almost reach
 the leader nearing the quarter pole and gave way.
