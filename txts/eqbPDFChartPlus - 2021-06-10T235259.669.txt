 Footnotes
 ZANCLUS quickly took command, set a demanding pace, hit the ninth fence but did not seem to be bothered, continued to set a quick pace while holding a
 clear lead over the fourteenth fence, doubled his lead moving strongly up the hill, hit the second-last fence but again was willing over the last fence and
 sprinted away under brisk urging in a very impressive performance. STRAIGHT TO IT was unhurried while rating through the lower part of the race, moved
 strongly to the fourteenth fence, drop back a bit on the hill, loomed boldly after the fifteenth fence then weakened. MYSTIC STRIKE dawdled at the rear of
 the pack, never challenged the leaders but finished the course to earn a part of the purse. DRIFT SOCIETY (IRE) rated off the top two during the lower part
 of the race, moved up near the ninth fence to challenge the leader at the tenth fence, made it a suspenseful race onto the hill, weakened before the fifteenth
 fence and then gave way through the stretch. WILDCATTER rated through four fences, moved up to press the pace before the ninth fence, gave way after
 the twelfth fence, was far back when he jumped the fourteenth fence, pulled up before the fifteenth fence and walked off. WHERE'S THE BEEF attended the
 pace through six fences, soon weakened near the ninth fence, pulled up before the eleventh fence and was vanned off.

 Footnotes
 FORMIDABLE HEART was unhurried on a realistic pace, struck the eighth fence, was well behind the top two in third place at the tenth fence, wasn't
 bothered when he hit the twelfth fence as he had begun his rally, steadily decreased the margin behind the leader, was still a dozen lengths back
 approaching the second-last fence, hit the final fence and was driven to the right and away from the leader, quickly gained command and showed a
 surprising turn of foot. VINTAGE VINNIE (IRE) quickly took command, sprinted off to a long lead after the third fence, hit the tenth fence, still held a long
 lead up the hill after the fourteenth fence, began weakening in the upper stretch, still held a clear lead over the last fence but then gave way. IT'S NOTHING
 trailed through twelve fences, hit the ninth fence, and passed tiring rivals. RAY DE LIGHT was unhurried, hit the eleventh fence and had no rally. JEWISH
 HOLIDAY settled early in the middle of the pack, hit the eleventh and thirteenth fences, gave way on the hill, was pulled up before the fifteenth fence and
 walked off. TAKEPOINTSANDRUN attended the pace through eleven fences, tired, was pulled up before the fifteenth fence and walked off. SIMPLY
 CERTAIN stalked the leader through eleven fences, was pulled up and vanned off.

 WITOR (GER) was unhurried dueled after ten fences, shook off Class Indian on the hill and drew off in hand as much the best. PIED DU ROI (IRE) stalked
 the pace throughout, hit the tenth and fifteenth fences, couldn't stay with the winner but proved clearly second best. AQUIES was unhurried early, steadily
 advanced after ten fences, loomed boldly two fences off but lacked the needed late response. PURED IT raced in the middle of the pack and lacked a rally.
 OUT PLAYING trailed through thirteen fences and passed tired rivals. CLASS INDIAN drew clear early, dueled after ten fences and gave way in the stretch.
 WHATDIDYOUSEE raced outside in the middle of the pack, hit the third fence then was hit in the chest by a propelled piece of board, soldiered until the
 long stretch after the thirteenth fence and gave way. BRIGHT MONBA pressed the early pace, stalked the dueling rivals after the tenth fence, bid for the
 lead after the eleventh fence but gave way before the fourteenth fence.
