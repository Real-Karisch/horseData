 Footnotes
 MANY WATERS always within striking distance while four then three wide, rallied to make the lead entering the stretch then finished full of run to win as
 much the best while being ridden out. SOUTHERN CANDY was hung five wide into the clubhouse turn, made the lead before a quarter three wide, opened
 a daylight advantage before a half, set the pace into the stretch, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack and was no match for the winner. PLEASANT
 TRUTH broke sharply, dropped back a bit four wide on the first turn, came on again three wide on the far turn then leveled off. WILLOWAMINA failed to
 menace. GINGER BOX was bumped and pinched back between horses at the start then failed to reach contention. MIZZENMYHONEYMOON vied for the
 early lead between horses and was through after a half. HIGH CUPPER had speed into the second turn then folded. MARI KEY bore out at the start
 bumping GINGER BOX, had early speed, stopped and was eased to the wire. BOLD DRAMA was through early, also stopped and was eased to the wire.
 Due to timer malfunction fractional timer were unavailable, final time was hand timed.

 CELESTIAL IMAGE made the lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace and drew off late under left handed urging. BRYNDIES JEWEL
 pressured the winner two wide and finished. WILD SKYE never far back, had a mild late rally in the six path. SANDCAT went evenly. INDIANA COWBOY
 found his best stride late. BRETT'S BOY settled, swung wide then passed tiring rivals. SHAWKLIT MILKSHAKE settled just off the leader, stopped inside
 near the half mile pole then faded through the stretch along the inside. ITINERARY was through early. FOREST BREEZE had speed into the turn then
 faded. SHOT FOR SHOT settled mid pack then lacked the needed response. IDEAL QUALITY trailed.
