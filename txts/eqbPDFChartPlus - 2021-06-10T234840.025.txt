 Footnotes
 RYE PATCH between horses early, stalked a bit off the rail, bid outside the pacesetter on the second turn and into the stretch, took the lead in upper
 stretch, inched away past midstretch and proved best under some urging. MALKO (IRE) saved ground chasing the pace, came out in upper stretch and
 again in deep stretch and finished willingly. LAZZAM (GB) chased outside a rival, came three deep into the stretch and finished well. HAY DUDE (GB)
 saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch, was momentarily a bit close off the heels of the runner-up in deep stretch and was outfinished.
 SILENT MOVIES had speed outside then alongside the winner, angled in and set the pace inside, dueled on the second turn, fought back inside in the
 stretch and weakened late. INDYGO BO pulled toward the inside then stalked a bit off the rail, went three deep on the second turn and five wide into the
 stretch and lacked the needed rally. SOUTH TEXAS LINGO squeezed a bit just after the start, settled outside a rival then a bit off the rail, came three wide
 into the stretch and could not offer the needed late kick. PEPPER CROWN chased a bit off the rail then outside a rival, went three deep into and on the
 second turn and four wide into the stretch and weakened. BURGER AND FRIES (FR) pulled and stalked outside a rival, continued between foes on the
 second turn and weakened in the stretch. A claim of foul by the rider of HAY DUDE against the runner-up for alleged interference in deep stretch was not
 allowed by the stewards, who ruled the incident did not alter the original order of finish.

 Footnotes
 SHENANDOAH QUEEN had speed inside then stalked a bit off the rail, bid between foes leaving the backstretch and outside the pacesetter on the second
 turn, took the lead into the stretch, kicked clear under urging and held. FAITHFULLY came in just after the start, stalked outside, bid four wide leaving the
 backstretch then fell back outside a foe on the second turn, came out into the stretch and came back on in the final furlong. MOTOWN LADY stalked off the
 rail then bid three deep between foes leaving the backstretch, also fell back off the rail on the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and bested the
 others. STREET SURRENDER had speed outside the winner then inched away and angled in, set the pace inside, dueled leaving the backstretch and on
 the second turn and into the stretch, then weakened. AUTUMN FLOWER in tight between foes just after the start, angled in on the first turn and chased
 inside, came out into the stretch and also weakened. MIDNIGHT TOAST steadied when squeezed just after the start, chased off the rail then pulled
 between foes early on the backstretch, continued just off the inside, angled in nearing the stretch and had little left for the drive. A claim of foul by the rider of
 MIDNIGHT TOAST against the runner-up for alleged interference after the start was not allowed by the stewards, who ruled the incident did not alter the
 original order of finish.

 Footnotes
 BOSS MOVE stalked four wide then three deep, continued outside on the turn and four wide into the stretch, gained the lead and inched away in midstretch
 then drew off under a crack of the whip and steady handling. FLY AS A FALCON stalked outside a rival, bid three deep into the turn, continued outside a foe
 on the bend and three wide into the stretch and edged the pacesetter for second. DREAM OF EAGLES sped to the early lead, set the pace a bit off the rail
 then inside, was not a match for the winner in the stretch and was edged for the place. WE WILL RE JOYCE stalked a bit off the rail, bid between horses
 early on the turn, tracked the leader just off the fence leaving the turn and weakened some in the stretch. DOVETAIL broke in and a bit slowly, settled
 inside, came out leaving the turn and three wide into the stretch and improved position. LUNA'S EMPIRE stalked three deep then off the rail, angled in
 outside a rival on the turn and did not rally. QUINNIE angled in and settled outside a rival, came out leaving the turn and four wide into the stretch and
 lacked a further response. SPACERIKA stalked between horses then a bit off the rail on the turn, angled in nearing the stretch and weakened. WEST
 PRINCESS saved ground stalking the pace, dropped back inside on the turn and had little left for the stretch. JUSTABEAN broke inward and behind the
 field, settled inside, came out leaving the turn and into the stretch and failed to menace.
