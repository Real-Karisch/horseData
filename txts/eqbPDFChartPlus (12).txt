 Footnotes
 BLACK CIRCLE well handed being patiently ridden in the back of the pace towards the inside, advanced mid turn, swung out six wide being aggressively
 ridden in upper stretch, finished fastest of all arriving in time for the victory. BEAR'S CONDUCTOR well placed tucking in behind duelers saving ground, cut
 the corner entering the stretch, put a head in front mid stretch, battled to the wire but was out nodded just missing in a very game effort. LONESOME
 HIGHWAY vied for the lead from the start, raced along the rail throughout, came to the two path upper stretch, headed from both sides for the drive, tired in
 deep stretch taking the show position. BRET'S AT CADDIES sat off a pair of duelers to the far turn, moved up three wide racing abreast for the lead mid
 turn, loomed to mid stretch then tired late missing a minor award. CHARNOCKS battled for the lead to the quarter pole, tired in mid stretch holding off
 others. MUMMI'S HOPE tracked down the backside running between, roused mid turn, lacked punch never menacing in the lane. LOVE RULES ALL was
 away a step slow trailing down the backside, raced four wide on the bend mounting a mild move, swung out seven to eight wide upper stretch, leveled off
 never threatening. PLAUSIBLY settled towards the rear racing inside, failed to factor. SARATOGA BOOT varied little traveling towards the rear throughout.
 BOPZILLA flashed brief early speed chasing to the far turn, faded from mid turn, no factor.

 Footnotes
 LADY MACHEN rushed to the lead, edged away at the quarter pole, moved to the three path entering the stretch, headed by LITTLE LIES from her out side,
 matched strides to the wire, dug in getting the head bob in a very determined effort. LITTLE LIES made a slight bobble at the break, quickly recovered to
 stalk, rallied three to four wide leaving the quarter pole, drew even with the winner in upper stretch, was denied in last strides while finishing a clearly second
 best. HOMEMADE BRANDY lacked early speed, came to mid track top of the lane, gained third place but never threatened. TEXTBOOK MILLIE dueled
 with the winner to mid turn, weakened turning for home, was no factor from mid stretch. INDYGO HUMOR lacked speed running mid track, dropped further
 behind from mid stretch showing little.

 Footnotes
 FIGHTMASTER rushed between rivals mid turn, took a slight lead at the quarter pole, angled to the four path top of the stretch, drew off winning
 convincingly in the final eighth. ALLPRIDE NO FACTS lagged behind to the quarter pole, swung out seven wide upper stretch, hit stride and made a furious
 finish grabbing second place in last jumps. ACADEMIC AFFAIR pressed for the lead soon after the start, was caught out four wide mid turn, vied to mid
 stretch, began to tire and was edged for second nearing the wire. TIZ FOR TAT tracked around the turn, mildly bid along the inside from mid stretch and
 narrowly missed third place. RACE READY made a four to five wide move entering the stretch, loomed off duelers in mid stretch, leveled off needing more
 late. FLASHY HUMOR settled in mid pack racing off the rail, failed to menace. PRECIOUS ENERGY was hard used fighting for the early lead, battled to the
 quarter pole, was all done and gave way inside the eighth pole. DOWN EIGHTY G varied little running in the second flight. GOLDLAND hustled along from
 the gate, pressed the leader to the quarter pole, faded from upper stretch. HIPPY RETURN lacked speed, raced along the rail while trailing in upper stretch,
 showed little.

 MAIN STAR settled early stalked the pace to the far turn pressing there taking over in upper stretch drawing off under a drive. ANAPA veered in brushing
 the gate then was in tight at the break, gave a prompted middle move leading on the far turn, extending inside down the lane proved no match holding up for
 place. HIGHLAND QUEEN dropped back early lagging to upper stretch, gave a mild rally at mid track angling in late. DESERT DOTTY stalked the pace
 weakening on the far turn, finished evenly in the four path. COMPROMISING played no factor. CHIQUITITA set the early pace then wilted on the far turn.
 HAPPY ELOISE pressed early then folded up on the far turn. ANDICE was done after a half mile.

 MOOVIN ON MACHEN well handled early sitting off a trio of duelers, advanced near the quarter pole, came four wide turning for home and raced abreast
 vying for the lead in mid stretch, edged clear late winning under ste4ady handling. JERRY THE BULL settled towards the rear, swung out five wide entering
 the stretch, closed willingly securing second place. PANAMA PRINCE pressed early, vied at the quarter pole running three wide between foes, tired late and
 was edged for second in a good effort. BRAIN SURGEON pressed for the lead from the start, dueled to mid stretch along the rail, weakened late.
 RHONDOO jumped the lead, headed from both sides mid turn, dueled to upper stretch, weakened in mid stretch, used up. FOUND A BUCK varied little, no
 factor. ZOIEE'S DREAM trailed soon after the start, roused mid turn but failed to respond, never factored.

 Footnotes
 STEW BOY gave a prompted middle move pressed to upper stretch edging up abreast foe late. SUNNY MILLS pressed the pace dueling to upper stretch
 battling inside of rival ceding grudgingly late. AFLEET PADDY tracked the pace chasing to upper stretch holding position with an even finish. MOUNTAIN
 GULCH slow early lost ground to upper stretch holding spot seven wide. TAPPINTOTHEMUSIC stalked the pace through the far turn then weakened near
 mid track in upper stretch. PHILIPPIC played no factor. HATHRAAN was never involved. STEREO IN MOTION pressed the early pace then tired on the far
 turn. GLOBAL ASSET pressed early then faded from the half. SLAP SHOT outrun early would tire.
