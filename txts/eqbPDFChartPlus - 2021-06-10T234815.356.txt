 Footnotes
 BOOM BOX bumped with RAMBLING RICHIE at the start but quickly recovered and sat well rated off the pace, uncorked his rally between horses and
 edged clear for the win. ONLY LIQUOR tracked the pace, ran gamely between horses down the lane but got brushed by RIP ROARIN RITCHIE just before
 the wire. RIP ROARIN RITCHIE hit the gate at the start but was quick into stride, set a pressured pace but shook clear in the stretch, dug in when the
 closers bore down but began to get tired and brushed with ONLY LIQUOR just before the wire. TURBULENT WAR was allowed to settle off the pace while
 running in the three path then uncorked a rally. PALE HOSE broke in a tangle but quickly recovered, tracked the pace but had to check nearing the three
 eighths pole when ONLY LIQUOR moved in a path going onto the turn, got back in stride and had a mild rally when asked. RAMBLING RICHIE bumped
 with BOOM BOX at the start but recovered to push the pace on the outside, turned for home in the three path and faded. STANLEY'S FRIEND ran towards
 the rear, never passed anyone but gained ground. BEL AIR BULLET trailed the whole way but managed to gain ground.

 ROSKILDE had a clear lead from the start, dug in for the drive and was able to hold off the closer. BOURBON CANDY chased the pace on the outside, hit
 his best stride with a sixteenth to go and almost got up in time. EDGING ran towards the rear, uncorked a rally but it was not enough. FRANKLIN COUNTY
 chased the pace on the inside but was no match. LEE'S LUCK was content to stay towards the rear, ran all out down the lane but was never a threat.
 FLYINGBYU came out of the gate awkwardly, was outrun from the start and never asked for more.

 GORILLA PANIC bumped with VAN LIER at the start then brushed with J K'S DREAM while coming into stride, ran towards the rear most of the way, made
 mild progress forward in the stretch then switched leads at the eighth pole and rolled ahead to win going away. BATTLE N AWAY chased the pace on the
 inside, edged clear inside the final furlong with a brief lead but was overwhelmed by the closer. GANGSTASPERFECTION tracked the pace the whole way,
 ran all out while on the rail and was the best of the rest. AWESOME ASHER had a clear lead from the get go but came up empty with a furlong to go. J K'S
 DREAM got brushed at the start by GORILLA PANIC then trailed the field but was able to pass tired rivals. ALWAYSMYPLEASURE lunged at the start then
 tracked the pace but lacked the needed rally. SASSY MAN ducked in at the start helping to pinch VAN LIER back, sat well rated off the pace and finished
 evenly. VAN LIER got pinched back at the start then was slow into stride and was no factor.

 WIND CHEATER was eager to push the pace on the outside, edged clear of rival and was able to hold off the closer. ALLAIRE chased the pace between
 horses, uncorked a rally on the outside and just missed the win. WILDWOOD RANGER set the pace while under constant outside pressure, dug in for the
 drive but grew tired late in the stretch. LA ACTIVA chased the pace on the inside, ran all out through the stretch but it was not enough. RULER RUNAWAY
 got jostled around a bit at the start then recovered to chase the pace between horses, went three wide around the turn and swung out at the top of the
 stretch looking for running room then finished evenly. SAYALILPRAYERFORME ducked in at the start bumping with RULER RUNAWAY, was content to
 trail the field in the three path and was able to pass a tired rival down the lane. R FOUR O ONE K chased the pace on the outside going three wide around
 the turn but lacked a rally.

 MO'S M V P ran towards the rear most of the way, turned for home in the three path weaving her way through horses, found a hold with a sixteenth to go
 and closed with a rush to get up in time. DONA SPEY was allowed to settle off the pace, swung for home in the five path closing willingly, briefly took the
 lead in the shadow of the wire but got sniped by the winner on the line. SUMMER SWEET was reluctant to load then ducked in at the start bumping with
 MALIBY ROYALTY and causing a domino effect on her inside, came away unfazed and stalked the pace, vied and took control of the lead in the stretch
 shaking clear of rivals but was caught by the closers. CRAFTY'S WAY sat well rated off the pace, turned for home in the four path running gamely between
 horses but her hole closed in just before the finish. MALIBU ROYALTY got squeezed back at the start but quickly recovered, was allowed to settle off the
 pace, ran all out down the lane but began to get tired and started drifting out before the finish. EVASIVE STORM was sluggish out of the gate and trailed the
 field most of the way, swung for home in the five path with a rally and was able to pass tiring rivals. JETE ETE got bumped at the start by REGENT
 DIAMOND from the domino effect SUMMER SWEET caused but was unfazed, quickly got up to take the lead and held it comfortably well into the turn for
 home, dug in when asked for more until she surrendered with a furlong to go. CIRCUIT REBOOT tracked the pace on the outside then lacked a rally.
 REGENT DIAMOND got squeezed at the start from SUMMER SWEET ducking in and causing a domino effect, tracked the pace on the inside but had no
 response when asked. CHAPEAU CHIC went around the first turn in the four path sitting well rated off the pace, gained some ground on the backstretch
 getting closer to the pace but stopped at the three eighths pole.
