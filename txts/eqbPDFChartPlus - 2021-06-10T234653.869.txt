 ROAR , steadied lacking room along the rail leaving the backstretch, got through inside on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch, advanced to
 mid stretch and flattened out. ZEPHYR TRAIN chased the pace two wide around the turn, eased out to the three path entering the stretch, drifted in near the
 eighth pole and weakened. CANDLESTICK NIC , four deep mid way on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and failed to rally. GREELEYS COPY ,
 unhurried down the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and failed to be a factor. ZHEN KAI , three wide on the turn, chased the pace to the
 stretch, stopped and was eased late. WASUP WILKO showed some early foot inside horses the opening quarter mile, dropped back leaving the turn and
 was eased.

 Footnotes
 BELFOUR stumbled at the break, recovered and pulled his way to command leaving the chute, set a rated pace towards the inside, was taken on by
 GOODLUCKJOHNATHAN leaving the far turn, handled that pressure under nice handling, spurted clear when shaken up entering the lane, kept on under
 strong left handed encouragement past the furlong grounds, had his rider switch to the right stick soon past the sixteenth pole and held firm. MUTARAABIT ,
 well placed three to four wide stalking the leaders, was under the whip past the three eighths pole, shifted out a bit to have aim on the winner into the lane,
 gave willing chase from there despite switching to his left lead late. GOODLUCKJOHNATHAN prompted the pace outside the winner, bid to apply more
 pressure after a half mile, forced the issue under a ride past the three eighths and faded in the final furlong. ADMIRATION broke a step slow, settled
 towards the inside while well back, shifted out late and failed to menace. FIRST DEGREE BURN stalked the pace while saving ground, failed to kick on
 leaving the half mile pole and faded.

 Footnotes
 SPRINGTIME WIND rated inside rivals nearing the turn, angled out for room leaving the three eighths pole, swept four wide to command entering the lane,
 moved clear with a furlong to go and steadily widened under repeated left handed encouragement. LOVE IN EXCESS tracked the pace in the two path, was
 sent up between rivals to challenge after a half mile, dueled and gained a slim lead near the quarter pole, could not resist the winner's charge in upper
 stretch but continued willingly to be well clear for the place. NANCY R prompted the pace three wide, bid three deep leaving the far turn, held a short
 advantage mid turn, dueled, steadied when not quite matching strides with the top pair soon into the lane and faded. GLORY UNBOUND , two wide
 between rivals, steadied off the heels of the winner leaving the three eighths pole, shifted in a bit and kept trying. EYE OF THE CHUB , four wide between
 rivals leaving the far turn, pursued to the quarter pole then weakened. PERFECT PARTY GIRL was rated back leaving the five eighths pole and taken five
 wide, moved up some after a half mile, chased to the head of the stretch then gave way. WHAT A LOOKER , three to four wide between runners, remained
 close for a half mile then tired. SAINTE THERESE disputed the pace inside rivals and tired leaving the quarter pole. An objection by the rider of GLORY
 UNBOUND against the winner for alleged interference around the turn was not allowed

 STAY WEST sped to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, was under urging in the drive and pulled away. LOST ON THE STAIRS , very rank
 leaving the starting gate, was four deep mid way on the turn, floated to the five path turning for home and failed to threaten the winner. JOYFUL NOISE ,
 three wide on the turn, floated to the four path entering the stretch and lacked a rally. LADYOFTHEHIERARCHY saved ground on the turn and gave way in
 upper stretch. SUDDEN HOPE chased the pace three wide to the stretch and faltered in upper stretch. LOOKIN PERFECT raced along the inner and
 stopped.

 Footnotes
 MILA JANE , in range three wide, took closer order under pressure past the three eighths pole, reeled in CHANCEE leaving the quarter pole, edged clear
 with a furlong to go then was fully extended to hold sway. DROPS AND BUCKETS stalked the early pace while between rivals, dropped back under some
 coaxing mid turn, was under a ride five wide into the lane, leveled off under left handed rousing past the furlong marker, came back gamely and switched to
 her left lead in the final yards. CHANCEE broke on top despite a stumble, regrouped and pulled her way forward, vied outside BERYL'S FLIGHT before
 going clear around the far turn, was nursed along around the turn, came under pressure two to three wide into the lane, ceded command past the three
 sixteenths but held well through the final furlong. ISLAND QUEEN , four to five wide, was under a ride mid turn and offered up a late kick. LITTLE LU ,
 forward early while under some rating, dropped back leaving the far turn, chased the pace then lacked a solid stretch kick. BERYL'S FLIGHT edged up
 inside rivals leaving the chute and grabbed a slim lead, vied inside CHANCEE, failed to go on with that one leaving the far turn, pursued to the head of the
 lane, angled out and faded. ALL GOOD TIMES , between rivals into the far turn, failed to menace.

 KAITAIN bore out at the break then corrected and drafted back off the pace, settled well off the inside, crept closer four wide leaving the far turn, sustained
 and rallied to a narrow lead outside INJAAZAAT leaving the quarter pole, dueled outside that one from there and held firm under stout handling. INJAAZAAT
 tracked inside early on, dropped back some leaving the far turn, regrouped and made a quick rail run to be on near even terms in upper stretch, battled
 valiantly inside the winner and just missed. PAINTED PATCHEN broke a bit slow, edged up nearing the three quarter pole, stalked between rivals leaving
 the far turn, shifted five wide to have aim into the lane but went evenly in the final furlong. RARE CANDY , off the pace while saving some ground, swung
 out under a ride entering the lane but failed to menace. PEOPLE'S CHAMP bore out at the break, straightened and pulled his way clear, set a rated pace off
 the inside, was confronted from both sides nearing the lane, gave little resistance and faltered through the final quarter mile. HIGHWAY RUN chased off the
 rail and tired in upper stretch.

 Footnotes
 MALIBU AT MIDNIGHT , two wide on the turn, was under urging through the stretch, took the lead near the eighth pole then drew off. IMAGINAR set the
 pace, saved ground on the turn and gave way grudgingly. MACUE , two wide on the turn, angled to the three path turning for home and gained the show.
 ZEKE THE STREAK saved ground on the turn chasing the pace and weakened through the stretch. ROMAN WARRIOR , three deep on the turn, was not a
 factor. MAJESTIC GOLDMINER , shuffled back entering the turn, dropped back after five furlongs.
