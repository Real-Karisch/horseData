 STRATEGIC EKATI unhurried early, responded readily when set down near the far turn, closed determinedly four wide and got up in the final strides.
 FATHER DENNIS with the second flight, rand up on ARAZI LIKE MOVE'S heels at the furlong marker, checked and dropped inside then came on again
 along the rail and just missed. ARAZI LIKE MOVE pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and just missed
 hanging on between rivals two wide. UNTO THOU allowed to settle, closed a gap late in the four path. CLYDE PARK stalked the early pace, offered a mild
 bid three wide on the far turn then came up empty. AMERICAN LUXURY away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the second turn then gave way.
 BEAUKATI was no factor. GATLING broke slowly, was never close and eased the length of the stretch to the wire and walked off.

 SWEET CHELSEA was bumped at the start, allowed to settle, circled rivals six wide into the stretch, made the lead inside the furlong marker and burst clear
 under right handed urging to win going away. SHOW ME SOME SASS stalked the pace two wide while between rivals, rallied to make the lead near mid
 stretch then was no match for the winner. JOSHEN XPRESS close up along the inside, checked midway on the turn, dropped back then came on again late
 two wide. COWTOWN HOME bore in at the start bumping the winner, was never far back, circled rivals six wide on the turn, made the lead before the
 furlong marker then was outfinished. HAREM'S CAT away alertly, settled within striking distance, inched closer three wide on the turn then failed to sustain
 that bid. LINDA N MICHELLE checked early along the inside while in tight, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then faded. PAPPIAS PLEASURE

 Footnotes
 CHIT CHATTING broke a bit slow, chased the pace two wide into the turn, rallied to make the lead near the quarter pole then finished full of run to win going
 away under a hand ride. BIONDETTA stalked the pace from the start, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the five path and finished
 well clear for second. SCHEMING went evenly. GAGLIANO bobbled and steadied at the start then failed to menace. ISLAND CHIC was no factor.
 IMPAZIBLE MINK bore in at the start, sped clear, set the pace into the turn, had speed into the stretch then faltered in the final furlong..

 MARRIAGE checked behind then between rivals entering the clubhouse turn, was always within striking distance settling near the inside, shifted out four
 wide on the far turn, rallied to make the lead before the furlong marker, shook clear readily under left handed urging and was taken in hand through the final
 yards. QUIET ALL AROUND pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, drifted out to the six path giving up ground then came on again late and finished
 second best. NESSUM DORMA was shut off at the start, trailed into the far turn then closed a gap late in the seven path. TENACIOUS JEWEL broke a step
 slow, vied for the lead three wide for a half, rallied to make the lead on the far turn, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. DRAGON BREATH
 bore out at the start, raced in the four path and lacked the needed response. LIGHTNING MISS broke in front and dropped inside, set a pressured pace into
 the far turn then gave way in the stretch. ITSALLABOUTTHEHYPE was through after a half.
