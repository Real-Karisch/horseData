 Footnotes
 MAGGIES PATROIT went straight to the lead to set the pace, challenged by ASALTANTE on the turn, dispatched that rival and forged clear late under
 steady handling. ASALTANTE pressed the eventual winner making a bid inside that rival leaving the turn, was no match but held second over BIGLICK, who
 was in tight at the break, began to pick it up on the turn moving between rivals five wide at the head of the lane, was gaining but too late. EXPECT A CAT
 broke outwardly, raced inside foes near but off the rail, went evenly. STRONGREACH chased the leading pair from off the inside, weakened.
 ARYESCELESTIC MAN was reluctant to load, passed tired foes. QUEPAZA BERNARDINI was within range of the early leaders four wide into the turn,
 came out a couple paths in upper stretch and was empty. MUNNY D'ORO broke inwardly and was subsequently in tight quarters, ridden along in the three
 path on the turn but had no rally.

 Footnotes
 BITTY BRIT broke outwardly just a bit, tracked from inside before moving up the rail to take the lead by the seven-sixteenths, drew off as much the best
 under steady handling. PROS POEM settled three wide toward the rear through the first turn, came out a bit to advance four wide on the far turn, was no
 match for the winner but secured the place. GOLDIE forced about four wide through the first turn, advanced with and just outside the aforementioned PROS
 POEM into the lane, captured show honors. SOMETIMES A REBEL was in a bit tight at the break, moved forward into the first turn then held up between
 rivals in the second flight into the backstretch, faced minor traffic past the quarter pole, went inside a rival turning for home, needed more. CALIFORNIA
 CUTIE was well-placed pursuing the leaders three to four wide, failed to rally. EMPIRE ZONE forced the pace in about the three path then emptied out.
 DUBLINS WILDBERRY flipped behind the gate then got loose briefly before being caught by the outrider, was a little fractious once in the gate, pressed the
 pace from inside a rival but off the fence, faded. TANYA WHO was a little fractious behind the gate and never a threat.

 Footnotes
 AMOR N PASION got away well enough then settled off the dueling leaders racing well off the inside, took aim in the stretch and powered home to drove
 past in late stretch. COMIC HOT ROD broke outwardly but sharply, shifted in to the two path then was engaged inside by HESA PROSPECTOR, dueled
 before putting that rival away by the head of the lane, was well clear into mid-stretch but reeled in late while weakening. BASHFUL BOB chased from inside
 the second flight, came out turning for home, ran on for show honors. HESA PROSPECTOR moved forward under mild coaxing, dueled inside the
 runner-up then gave way. LUCKY SANTY outpaced early, came into the stretch four to five wide and between foes and improved position. LIVINIT brushed
 the gate and was in tight at the start, ran inside foes but shifting to the three path turning into the stretch, needed more. JEDI FEVER fanned five to six wide
 into the stretch and had no rally. NEUTRALABSTRACTION was fractious behind the gate, chased three to four wide outside the second flight through the
 turn, shifted in a bit in upper stretch and was empty. CUIDANDO, reluctant to load, chased between runners in the second flight, faded.

 TIZ ALL BEHIND US set the pace racing off the rail, repelled the challenge of ANGELAFAR on the far turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, was safely
 clear. BOOMTIDEROCK shifted in early, saved ground through the first turn tracking inside, switched out on the far turn, fanned five wide into the stretch,
 was second best. GRIS CITY eased back from between runners and shifted in two to three wide on the first turn, ran mostly in those paths and captured
 show honors. ANGELAFAR caught six then five wide on the first turn, advanced to make a mild bid nearing the quarter pole, shifted in having reached upper
 stretch and flattened out. MISS RULES was mostly three to four wide, had no rally. SOUL POWER chased the winner from near inside, faded. LOVE U
 LATER was in just a bit tight at the break and trailed.

 QUITE PEACE settled mid-division off the inside, shifted in on the turn, came out a bit turning for home to pace TRACE OF GOLD, bid inside MY INDIAN
 WARRIOR in mid-stretch taking control about the sixteenth pole to prevail. MY INDIAN WARRIOR vied between runners then outside TRACE OF GOLD,
 took a clear advantage while drift out a bit to be three to four wide in the stretch, was outkicked while clearly second best. TRACE OF GOLD vied inside,
 was no match for the top two. REVELATION DIVINE was forced into a foe at the start, settled into stride, had to alter course outside a stricken rival near the
 five-sixteenths then back inside nearing the quarter pole, improved position. AMAZINBLAZIN was bumped at the start, chased from inside before shifting
 four wide about three furlongs out, had no rally in the stretch. J C STREET raced off the inside, shifted further still to be seven wide in the stretch and ran on
 evenly. REXELLENT stalked the leaders from outside going five wide on the turn and was empty in the drive. WAYLAY reared at the start, had to steady
 and alter course to avoid a stricken foe about the five-sixteenths. HEAVEN'S REIGN broke inwardly and failed to menace. TIZA FINE FELLA contended
 three wide, was stricken with what appeared to be an injury to the left front about the five-sixteenths pole, pulled up, euthanized on track and vanned off.

 AUSSIE ROCKS (GB) got away alertly, eased back content to track inside, switched out to pass BOX OFFICE APPEAL on the far turn, bid between rivals in
 upper stretch, dueled inside TIZPAT gamely to prevail. TIZPAT caught four to five wide in the early going, moved up to press the issue into the far turn
 roughly three to four wide, dueled outside the aforementioned but was outfinished. STAND UP STAND OUT, unhurried early, swung six wide into the lane,
 finished well to just get up for show over SHEPHERD'S PRIDE, who moved forward outside foes four then three wide on the first turn attending the pace
 just off BOX OFFICE APPEAL, moved closer to challenge from between rivals on the far turn, shifted in past the quarter pole and weakened. CLASSIC
 GENT raced on or just off the inside throughout and needed more. EASY TOPPER tracked in behind racing mostly three to four wide throughout and went
 evenly. MUSIC GIANT shifted in about two wide on the first turn to save some ground, came out and advanced four to five wide on the far turn but lacked
 the needed late kick. CYBER STAR came out seven wide into upper stretch and had no rally. BOX OFFICE APPEAL set the pace off the rail, gave way.
 CAGE RATTLER tracked early from on or just off the rail, weakened.

 advanced five then six wide on the turn, closed the gap on the runner-up but was too late. SECRET DREAMER shifted in racing inside foes but just off the
 rail, went evenly. SINGING MARY stalked off the leaders from off the inside going four to five wide on the turn, had no rally. TALK ABOUT CONTROL
 advanced up the backstretch and then between foes about the three-eighths, went three to four wide on the turn, flattened out in the lane. INDIAN DIVA
 chased from inside, retreated.

 Footnotes
 EMBELLISHING BOB tracked the leaders, made a bid inside leaving the turn to take the lead at the head of the lane, drifted out a bit in upper stretch while
 clear, held sway. DEVIL'S TEETH switched well off the inside in the early going, fanned seven wide into the stretch, got up for place over SLADENS
 DREAM, who moved quickly four to five wide to challenge at the three-eighths, came in a bit in upper stretch, just lost the place. CIRCUSTOWN FLYER
 was within range early, bid five to six wide near the quarter pole, evened out in the lane. DRIVEN JORDAN dueled inside a foe but off the rail, weakened.
 ROCK HARD CITY shifted in early, saved ground on the turn and passed foes. SOUTHERN MOJO dropped back early, was floated nine wide by IMA
 HAPPY STRIKE past the five-sixteenths, never produced a bid. MR MARCOM dueled outside a rival then between rivals into the turn, gave way. IMA
 HAPPY STRIKE was in close early, bore out through the turn, eased through the lane.
