 Footnotes
 PACIFIC SONG stalked between horses then outside, came three deep into the stretch, bid four wide between foes to gain the lead a sixteenth out and
 gamely prevailed under urging. STERLING'S TEMPLE was in a good position stalking he pace between rivals early then outside, continued four wide on the
 turn and into the stretch, bid five wide a sixteenth out and continued willingly to just miss. SPEND IT chased a bit off the rail then inside on the turn and
 through the stretch and bested the others. BLAZE OF GLORY dueled inside, fought back on the turn, came from the whip in the stretch, was between foes a
 sixteenth out and weakened late. JUNE TWO FOUR broke a bit slowly, chased inside, split rivals on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked
 the needed rally. AWESOME E K dueled four wide then outside a rival on the turn and into the stretch, regained the advantage, was between foes a
 sixteenth out and weakened late. STARSHIP CHEWY settled off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and did not rally. JONAS pulled between rivals then
 chased outside on the turn and three deep into the stretch and had little left for the drive. WELLDIDYOUGETIT squeezed a bit at the start, dueled between
 horses, stalked a bit off the rail on the turn, dropped back between foes leaving the turn and also had little left for the stretch. SCORPIO dueled between
 rivals, dropped back into and on the turn and gave way.
