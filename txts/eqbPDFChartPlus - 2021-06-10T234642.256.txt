 SHUT THE GATE raced forwardly while three wide, responded into the stretch and wore down her foes under a drive. OUR ADDI BELLE settled while four
 wide, advanced on the turn, continued four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. DIVINE WAY set a contested pace along the rail, was headed leaving
 the turn and gave way in the late going. SMOKE OUT forced the pace, was steadied at the furlong marker and dropped back. MISS COCO outpaced early,
 moved closer on the turn, was angled five wide to take aim and had no rally. MADAME CLOUET was always outrun. MY STAR OASIS took no part.
 FOLLOWING THE RACE, THERE WAS BOTH A STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL INTO THE STRETCH RUN. AFTER
 REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SHUT THE GATE FOR INTERFERING WITH SMOKE OUT AND PLACED HER
 FOURTH.

 Footnotes
 DTATER prompted the pace, took over on the turn, was challenged late and all out to get the nod. TODAY'S TALK saved ground, advanced on the turn,
 continued inside for the stretch run, rallied, shied late from the lights on the finish pole and missed. ALLEYES ON WILMA bumped at the start, was forwardly
 placed and stayed on. HAVE TO GO chased the pace and showed some mild late interest. ROBIN'S LANDING leaned out at the start and failed to threaten.
 LAINE'S PEACH was void of speed and displayed belated interest. GETTIUP AND GO never menaced. TYRNIES EDITH DAHL was always outrun. EIGHT
 SISTERS proved no factor. MADE IN FLAME leaned in at the start and retreated.
