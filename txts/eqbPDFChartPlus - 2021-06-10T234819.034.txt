 Footnotes
 MISS FORESTER showed speed, dueled from the inside on the far turn and fought gamely for the win. BANGLA DANCER forced the pace and had a slim
 lead on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinsihed. ANNIE O'SCHILLER was unhurried early and raced evenly on the far turn
 but needed more. MARILYNS LAST LOVE was in touch and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. SWEET BREW
 was in range and saved ground on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch lacked a serious bid. EUMENIDES was off the pace and had a
 mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. TWO BREWS TO GO had no speed and showed little in a dull
 effort. WHYAGOTTOBETHATWAY was well back and showed nothing while outrun. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON SWEET BREW AGAINST
 ANNIE O'SCHILLER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.
