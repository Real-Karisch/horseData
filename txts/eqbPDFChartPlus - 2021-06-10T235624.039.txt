 Footnotes
 THUMB RUN settled back about the three path the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, improved four
 wide on the far turn, took over mid-stretch and drew off the final sixteenth. HOLY CHROME tapered in through the front stretch to stalk the pace two deep,
 raced at even terms nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dug in to best Rumors Are True through the lane while caught by the winner mid-stretch.
 RUMERS ARE TRUE tapered in through the front stretch and took the lead approaching the three quarter pole, was met at even terms nearing the seven
 sixteenths pole, matched strides with the runner-up nearest the rail from that point but yielded to that one mid-stretch. CHARITABLE ELLIE settled just off
 the pace three and four wide, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, improved her position through the far turn and passed some tiring rivals. MISS SIMON
 settled close in the two and three paths the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened out down the lane.
 INDIAN SPRINKLES saved ground off the pace, eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path
 and showed little further. TWISTED CASTLE rated just off the pace about the four path the first turn and settled close into the backstretch, bid nearing the
 three eighths pole, raced in range of the leaders through most of the far turn but dropped back into the lane and weakened in the drive. FRECCIA ROSSA
 saved ground. After stumbling from the gate, LITTLE PUNCHES raced five wide the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then
 weakened rounding the far turn. INSIDIOUS CAT rated close to the early pace, was boxed at the rail at the nine sixteenths pole then faded after a half mile.

 Footnotes
 SILKEN BELLE gave chase from the outside and saved ground moving into the turn to race in the three path, then drove down the lane, taking over near
 the sixteenth pole, and widened to the wire. DECIDING FACTOR battled to the front to set the pace inside, rounded the turn on the rail, then dug in gamely
 down the stretch but was caught near the sixteenth pole and had to settle for second. ALLEGHENY MACGRAW gave chase on the outside and rounded the
 turn in the five path, then gained down the lane and finished evenly. CHARITABLE ANGEL broke out and bumped Mistro Ali at the start then gave chase
 three wide between horses, angled in to round the turn in the three path, then finished evenly. HATTA DOUBLE gave chase inside and rounded the turn on
 the rail, but leveled off in the lane. CLASS OF CONCERN gave chase well back on the outside, improved through the turn in the five path, then finished
 evenly. BLOWN AWAY BABY gave chase well off the pace on the inside, eased out moving into the turn to the four path, then weakened in the stretch. K.
 RENEE was never a factor. MISTRO ALI was bumped at the start by Charitable Angel and gave chase outside and rounded the turn in the eight path, then
 leveled off in the stretch. HAY KAREN was never a factor.

 SPANISH MOSS settled off the pace on the outside and took over near the three-eighths pole without encouragement, drew clear past the five-sixteenths
 pole and angled in to round the turn on the rail while widening her lead, then drew off even more in the stretch. ANNIES ALLIANCE, saving ground into the
 first turn, settled off the pace inside, made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole and steadily improved through the turn in the five path, then dug in gamely
 down the lane but was outfinished. CHARITABLE HEART broke a step slow then saved ground going into the first turn and settled well off the pace inside,
 made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole and eased out to take the far turn in the five path, then saved ground leaving the turn and finished evenly.
 HOUSE OF LOVE settled well off the pace on the outside and made a bid leaving the five-sixteenths pole, took the far turn in the seven path, then moved
 out to mid-track leaving the turn and finished widest. JEFFERSON BOP set a pressured pace on the inside but was caught near the nine-sixteenths pole

 moderately asked in the upper stretch then relaxed in later yards. COU ROUGE settled back outside after coming away a step slow, bid leaving the five
 sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the five path then had to settle for second best. ME VOY gave chase about the four path, rounded the turn off the rail
 and finished evenly for third. SHAMROCK GREEN pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back at the quarter pole, drifted leaving the turn
 and flattened stride down the lane. HONYBADGERDONTCARE chased the early pace off the rail, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted into the lane
 and weakened in the drive. DOMINIC THE QUICK steadied on the chute then picked up the chase toward mid track, rounded the turn about the five path
 and finished evenly. I NEED YOU raced well back from the early leaders toward mid track then rounded the turn in the six path. MIGHTY BOP saved
 ground.

 ALL BLINGED OUT rated close off the rail, eased out with a bid approaching the three eighths pole, took aim at the quarter, dueled for the lead two deep
 midway on the far turn then dug in under determined handling to earn the nod through the final yards. ANYWHERE BUT HERE rated close four wide the
 first turn, took the lead toward the three eighths pole, dueled clear approaching the quarter, was challenged at the rail midway through the turn and dug in
 gamely to deep stretch before ceding the final yards; grudgingly. PAPA C AND B saved ground off the early pace then angled out through the second turn,
 settled toward the outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole but bore out from the mid point of the far turn and flattened out down the
 lane. LIMEHOUSER rated a slim lead inside, was headed nearing the seven sixteenths pole, yielded the edge toward the three eighths then weakened at
 the rail rounding the far turn. COULD IT BE ME rated close five wide the first turn and settled just off the pace through the front stretch, rounded the second
 turn still five wide, bid nearing the three eighths pole then flattened stride in the four path of the final turn. HURRICANE HAROLD rated with the pace about
 the three path, challenged nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced between horses from that point then dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded
 through the far turn. DEANDREA'S PRIDE rated just off the pace about the three path the first turn then faded past the three eighths pole. All Blinged Out is
 disqualified from earings per Ruling 163.

 Footnotes
 AARON'S TAP hustled up and angled in to rate the pace inside, rounded the turn on the rail, then drove down the lane under steady handling and held on
 well. SAINT IGNATIUS settled well off the pace on the outside and made a bid approaching the five-sixteenths pole, steadily improved through the far turn
 in the six path, then gained down the lane and finished well. MORE DATA settled off the pace on the outside, made a bid approaching the five-sixteenths
 pole and rounded the turn in the three path, but leveled off in the stretch. KOPPER WIRED, saving ground in the first turn, raced well back early, made a bid
 midway through the far turn in the three path, then swung out to mid-track leaving the turn and finished well on the outside. ARCHER ONE saved ground
 into the first turn and was steadied at the heels of Aaron's Tap at the five-eighths pole, eased out past the nine-sixteenths, was taken up near the
 five-sixteenths pole and angled out to the five path through the turn, then leveled off in the stretch. SLICKY BOY was never a factor. LONGSTREAK settled
 off the pace two deep, made a mild bid near the five-sixteenths pole, then dropped back through the turn on the rail and faded in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 GRANDMA'S GHOST raced well back from the early leaders toward the inside, eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
 progressed steadily in the five path rounding the far turn, took the lead past the eighth pole and drew off under steady handling. ALOHA ANNIE rounded the
 opening turn in the three and four paths, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, had aim three wide approaching the head of the lane, dueled for
 second mid-stretch and dug in from there to hold that position. THESLEEPYBEAUTY settled off the pace and off the rail, bid approaching the five sixteenths
 pole, closed to the heels of the waning Mybigsistercarrie nearing the head of the lane, came inside that one past the eighth pole but was outfinished in the
 duel for second. LADYS CROSS FIRST raced boxed at the rail at the five eighths pole and dropped back through the opening turn, steadied at the heels of
 Charitable Girl approaching the five sixteenths pole, eased out into the far turn, progressed in the four path through the turn and finished evenly.
 MYBIGSISTERCARRIE quickly took the lead and rated the pace inside, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, caught past the eighth and weakened
 in the drive. BRING ON THE GREY raced in the six path the opening turn and settled toward the outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths
 pole, improved her position in the three path of the far turn but showed little further down the lane. WHY NOT ANNIE saved ground well off the pace the first
 turn and showed little response through the backstretch. MAVIS, off the pace in the four path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at a
 close disadvantage through the far turn but weakened from the head of the lane. CHARITABLE GIRL, off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving the seven
 sixteenths pole but lost momentum approaching the quarter pole and showed little further. ATTAINED FREEDOM raced in the five path the first turn and
 settled close into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded toward the far turn.
