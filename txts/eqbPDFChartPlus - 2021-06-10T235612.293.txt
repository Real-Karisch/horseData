 Footnotes
 SPRING EMPEROR tracked the leaders for a half-mile, ranged up three wide to contention near the three-eighths, took over turning for home and drew
 clear, and kept BOB'S MY UNCLE at a safe distance late. BOB'S MY UNCLE lagged in the second flight early, rallied two then three wide coming through
 between horses at the top of the stretch, and could not reach the winner while clearly best of the others. ZITMAN lacked room after the start and was slow to
 get going, had a three-wide trip and was along for the show. SMART TWO A T moved up four wide around the far turn, flattened out through upper stretch
 and faded. EARNED IT raced near the two-path much of the way while never prominent. WE B JAMMIN battled for command outside MY COWBOY, and
 gave way after six furlongs. MY COWBOY argued the pace inside WE B JAMMIN to the far turn, and had nothing left.

 Footnotes
 DEFEND THE BAY chased after the leaders four wide, advanced to challenge for command after a half-mile, and edged away through the late stages.
 PURRS WELL saved ground outsprinted for a half, stayed inside for the drive and rallied willingly. VILLAGE PRINCE dropped back after an alert break,
 lagged well back three wide to the stretch, and finished with interest between the top two. FLYING BANKROLL moved up four then five wide around the
 turn, and lacked the needed final bid on the far outside. WARRIOR'S DELIGHT rushed up inside to get the lead, came under pressure from several
 pursuers around the turn, and drifted out through the furlong grounds while weakening. NOONTIME SALSA pressed the pace two wide, and began to fade
 before reaching the stretch. JACKS CITY pressed the pace between horses three wide, and tired in the stretch. THUMBPRINT was outrun throughout
 inside. CREDIT CYCLE was strung out five wide and never menaced.

 I'M LISTENING tucked in behind the leaders through the stretch the first time, hugged the rail in easy striking range, slipped through inside BLUE ATLAS to
 poke a head in front an eighth of a mile out, and edged away under good handling. BLUE ATLAS sprinted clear early, saved ground showing the way
 through even fractions, drifted to the two-path leaving the rail open turning for home, was overtaken from the inside and stayed on well. FREE TO FLY
 prompted the pace two wide, loomed a threat at the top of the stretch but was outkicked outside the top two. BLACK DYNAMITE stayed in range three wide
 for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late response. TAP DANCE STAR was slow into stride and trailed inside early, moved out three wide and could not
 threaten. STATED was no factor through an even effort near the inside. FOR KICKS raced two to three wide and made no impact.

 Footnotes
 VIRADIA tucked in off the leaders a bit keen through the first turn, dropped back inside despite urging around the far turn, altered course off the rail nearing
 the furlong marker and kicked in to get past BLUE SUADE GUITAR and draw clear. MIJA BELLA was widest up the backstretch, advanced out of last after
 a half-mile, and continued to improve position on the far outside through the lane. BLUE SUADE GUITAR dueled for the lead inside ALEXA ROSE for six
 furlongs, shook clear into the stretch drifting out slightly, and weakened once overtaken by the winner. CAT GIUMARELLO stayed close early three wide,
 lost ground in the two-path after six furlongs, and ran on evenly without a rally. JOST SAYIN was three wide on the first turn, moved inside and did not
 become a factor. ALEXA ROSE contested the pace outside BLUE SUADE GUITAR for six furlongs, and gave way into the lane. THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
 was covered up between horses just off the leaders to the far turn, and came up empty when roused.

 UNCLE MO'S AFFAIR delayed the start while difficult to load, came away in good order and quickly took command, rated along inside unbothered through
 an even pace, and responded through the lane to get the decision. BACKYARD FUN prompted the pace two wide to the stretch, and kept on with good
 courage to be edging closer late. SMOOCHIN CANDY saved ground in range for six furlongs, stayed inside rallying through the lane, was in tight on the rail
 behind the winner coming to the wire and was nipped for the place. DILLY DOES IT was outrun early, remained well back four wide around the far turn, and
 gained belatedly. AVOCADO tracked the leaders three wide into the far turn, and had no rally. BROKEN ENGLISH raced two wide between horses on the
 far turn, and had no late kick through the lane on the far outside. SOLDAT HOUSE was outrun inside. JUST A WHIM was outrun two wide. LOYAL
 AFICIONADA went to the first turn three wide, and was done after six furlongs.

 SIR BOND was outrun early, began moving four wide around the turn, and rallied determinedly to overtake the leaders from outside in deep stretch. MORE
 FRONT was close-up early inside, moved out to the three-path with a bid through the furlong grounds and gained a brief lead, could not hold off the winner
 and saved the place. TIPIT was well back two wide for a half-mile, rallied with interest and narrowly missed second. HURRICANE BEAR settled in the
 middle of the field two wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed late response. CONCORDIA'S WAY dueled for the lead outside FORTY FATHOMS from
 the start, and gave way entering the final furlong. FORTY FATHOMS vied inside CONCORDIA'S WAY from the outset, and gave way through the late
 stages. OFF DUTY raced three wide in range to the stretch, and tired. SMALL GIANT was through early inside.

 Footnotes
 TALKLESS SMILEMORE went right to the front, leaned in entering the first turn putting COSITA RICE in tight, cleared off and rated along inside for six
 furlongs, and dug in through deep stretch to narrowly prevail. G Q GIRL was in close quarters between horses into the first turn, stayed in the two-path to
 the lane, rallied with good courage and just missed. SHES DYNOMITE raced three wide around the turns in the middle of the field, and was closing in
 outside through the final yards. COSITA RICA steadied in tight along the rail inside TALKLESS SMILEMORE entering the first turn, moved outside that one
 to prompt the pace for six furlongs, and could not muster the needed final response. JERMYN STREET checked sharply behind horses entering the first
 turn, raced three wide to the stretch and gained mildly late. IMPORTANT was always outrun. BILLYSCRYSTALBALL steadied behind COSITA RICA
 entering the first turn moving off the inside to the two-path, and was finished early. DIGITAL DIVA was never in the hunt. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY
 THE RIDER OF SHES DYNOMITE AGAINST G Q GIRL, OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDER OF JERMYN STREET AGAINST COSITA RICA AND TALKLESS
 SMILEMORE, AND A STEWARDS INQURY INTO THE RUN TO THE FIRST TURN, TALKLESS SMILEMORE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST
 POSITION AND PLACED SEVENTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE.

 Footnotes
 STEADY LOVE was part of a six-way fight up front early, outdueled REVOLVING LOVE past the eighth-pole and drove clear. WORSTBESTIDEAEVER
 hesitated at the start to get away behind the field, advanced three wide off the turn and rallied for the place. PETES PRIDE held a short early lead
 surrounded by five challengers, dropped back to next-to-last through the second quarter-mile, came five wide off the turn and finished with good courage.
 BOURBON STYLE was part of the six-way pace skirmish between horses three wide, and weakened in the stretch. REVOLVING LOVE was in the four-path
 volleying near the front up the backstretch, held a short lead into the stretch while shifting inward, and weakened late on the rail. STYLISH NINETYNINE
 battled up front between foes in the two-path early, and faded approaching the stretch. BE BOP A LOLA argued the pace innermost of six across the track
 up the backstretch, gave way on the turn and dropped well back. RUBY'S RUSH eyed the battle royale up the backstretch, but could not keep pace after a
 quarter-mile.

 Footnotes
 LAZUR HESS tracked outside MIZZDORA early, took over around the far turn and pulled clear, widened under a drive to the sixteenth pole and was in hand
 late. MIZZDORA set the pace inside to the far turn, was powerless to fend off the winner, but held well to be second best. BELLFASTT raced two wide on
 the turns, and plugged along for the show. ROYALLY BRED was forwardly placed inside early, and tired. COLORS IN MOTION advanced three wide
 through the middle stages, but gave way after six furlongs. DAHESSTINY MC dropped far back after a half-mile. BURN NOTICE MC dropped far back after
 a half-mile.
