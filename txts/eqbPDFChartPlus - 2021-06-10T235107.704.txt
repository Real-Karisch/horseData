 Footnotes
 FILM ACTRESS bid three wide on the far turn and reached the front nearing the quarter pole, drew clear under urging then drew out while ridden out
 through the final yards. HAPPY MAGGIE took a stutter step at the start, was steadied along the inside on the clubhouse turn, saved ground to the lane and
 earned the place. CONFED tracked early, bid for the lead on the far turn while between rivals then needed more. UH OH SEVEN set the pace inside,
 continued on willingly into midstretch then yielded the place and show slots. WEST PRINCESS trailed and saved ground, raced just off the inside turning for
 home and lacked the needed response. HAPPY PILL between foes entering the far turn, raced in the five path into the lane and lacked a stretch bid.
 LORANAN four deep leaving the backstretch, raced five wide turning for home and had no rally. RYAN'S STAR up close early, raced just off the inside and
 weakened on the far turn.

 TOMORROW'S MINE broke out and bumped at the start, stalked the pace while racing outside, rallied four across on the turn, swung seven wide entering
 the stretch, dueled to the final strides and inched away to prove best. JOSIE TREASURE was sent to the front, raced between horses to turn, dueled to the
 final strides and yielded grudgingly. LU LU GIRL hesitated at the start to be off slowly, was never far back while racing off the rail, bid four wide and was
 along for show while no threat to the top two. MARYMOOR PARK pressed the pace three across to the turn, swung six wide and gave way. DREAMING EZ
 vied inside to the turn and stopped. CYCLOTRICK bumped at the start, trailed the field and showed little.

 ALL TRUMPED UP in good position just off the battling leaders, raced in the five path entering the lane and chased then finished steadily and drew clear.
 TIGER MARK raced six wide turning for home and finished gamely while earning the place at the wire. ALTERED CARBON dueled inside, drew clear in the
 lane then could not match the eventual winner and was caught at the wire for the place. MR. IRRELEVANT raced in the four path entering the stretch and
 offered a late gain. MAKEAMERICAGRTAGIN was just off the inside turning for home and lacked a bid. OVER EZ battled for command outside ALTERED
 CARBON, drifted some into the lane and tired. BOB T chased early, saved ground and weakened. MIDNITE DEPUTY was slow away from the gate then
 raced well back while not a factor.

 Footnotes
 COLONEL GOTHAM set a pressured pace to the second turn, drew off for a clear lead and was kept to task. MADIKWE pressed the pace three across to
 the second turn, fell back, finished evenly and was all out for place. JEN'S BIG O raced mid pack outside, went seven wide entering the stretch and finished
 well to get up for show. TAX CREDIT was void of early speed, angled in in the upper stretch and finished well inside. READY FOR LUCK broke slowly and
 was pinched back at the start, raced in the back, went eight wide leaving the turn and closed well. ROYALIST was in tight and steadied entering the first
 turn, raced mid pack and did not threaten under mild urging. KING REZA was through after a half. VAN HAGAR was in tight at the start, never far back while
 racing outside and had nothing left for the drive. DANCING ZAPPER pressed the pace two wide between horses to the second turn, fell back, weakened
 and faded. THE GREAT LEBOWSKI stumbled at the start, trailed the field and showed little.

 second turn, fell back, finished evenly and lost position. WALLY'S GOT CLASS lagged early, bid inside leaving the turn and hung late. TRIBAL TRIBUTE
 stalked the pace to the second turn, fell back, went seven wide at the top of the lane and lacked a rally. THREE RED SEVENS was outrun in an even effort.
 GUNFIRE failed to respond. SOLEMNLY SWEAR was not a factor.
