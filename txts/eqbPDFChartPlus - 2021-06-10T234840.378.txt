 Footnotes
 SCOTTISH BU broke with the field, allowed the pace to go early, moved out, advanced in the three path into contention late turn. MY GAL SARAH sprinted
 clear off the inside, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted by that one into the lane, remained clear for the place. GO SAL GO chased the
 runner up early off the rail, also proved no match for the winner in the drive, not enough for the place in finishing up evenly. FONDA CARLOS hesitated at
 the start, raced five wide into the stretch, improved slightly past the furlong marker without posing a serious threat. CHERRY LAUREL broke in the air, failed
 to menace. SWAMP PRODUCTION was finished early.

 STOUT MARGARET showed the way from along the inside, responded when called on for more nearing the furlong marker, dug in and led to the wire while
 drifting out in the final strides to help put JACINTA in tight. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH,
 THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. BRANDY STATION dropped to the inside the opening quarter when behind the two leaders, moved out and
 advanced three wide into the lane, challenged while widest nearing the furlong grounds, long drive to the wire, drifted in late to also contribute to tight
 quarters for JACINTA, outfinished. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF JACINTA AGASINT BRANDY STATION FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN
 DEEP STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED. JACINTA pressured the winner from the outside, continued to apply pressure when joined by the runner up
 approaching midstretch, saw any progress on the winner stall late, in tight at the wire while remaining between the top two. I'M A GREAT REBEL last away,
 trailed throughout and was never a threat.

 PI broke alertly, set all the pace while racing off the inside, continued to show the way into the lane, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under
 steady handling. LA REINA ISABEL back off the early pace, moved in a bit to race in the two path through the turn, set down for the drive, finished willingly
 to be well clear for the place, no match for the winner. MY RUSTON saved ground while behind the pace, continued inside into the lane, could do little with
 the top two, clear of the others. BEAULEY closest to the winner for a half while racing in the three path, had little left for the drive. RUSTON KITTEN within
 striking distance for a half well out in the strip, also weakened in the drive. MINK COAT MIMI broke with the leaders, fell back, lacked a response in the
 drive. A LA FOLIE trailed throughout to be always outrun.

 Footnotes
 PUTSUMDIRTONIT broke out, bumped foe, raced back off the pace, three wide into the lane when beginning to rally, collared the dueling leaders with less
 than a furlong remaining, continued with good energy to win going away. EXOTIC SIN broke sharp, alternated up front off the inside, proved no match for
 the winner the final sixteenth, proved determined for the place. CONSPICUOUS WOMAN also away well, dueled up front inside the runner up, outkicked by
 that one in the late going for the place. REDDING WELL sandwiched at the start, raced in mid pack off the inside, three wide turn, went evenly through the
 stretch in lacking a late response. FLOATIE went one paced throughout while racing along the inside. ANY OLE THING off a bit slow, never a threat.
 BULLETSANDBOURBON broke out, had nothing for the drive. MARY BELL broke in, fell far back to be outrun.

 Footnotes
 TSUNAMI GIRL broke with main pack, 2nd flight early, saved some ground through the turn, continued inside to lodge a rail bid inside the leader past the
 furlong marker, drove clear under steady handling. CHARLEY'S SMILE vied up front early along the inside, shook clear in the turn, allowed the winner the
 inside past midstretch, no match for that one, remained far clear of the others. BAM BAM'S PRIDE settled off the pace and the inside, dropped in on the
 turn, could do little with the top two in the drive, finished best of the rest. PRAY LASSIE forwardly placed in the early going, had little left for the drive.
 ROMANTIC STROLL void of early foot, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. MS DEALMAKER remained always back. ROSE'S ASSET off
 slow, was used to quickly move up and force the issue early, stopped in the turn, fell far back and was jogged across the wire.

 YANKEE CON broke alertly, soon sprinted well clear, held a large advantage into and through the turn toward the inside, not threatened in the drive while
 being kept to task. GRAND HOGA in the second flight outside, raced four wide through the turn, could do little with the winner in the drive, remained clear
 for the place. STORMING BY YAWL settled off the early pace, also raced four wide out of the turn when staging a mild rally, flattened out the final furlong,
 narrowly saved the show. UNK'S RED MAN void of early foot, came five wide into the lane, staged a rally well out in the strip and was gaining for the show
 spot. CADILLAC CARTER in the second group three wide early, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. SURE CAN DO well back in
 the early going, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. SUPER CHASE steadily faded. ON THE TAKE also backed up through the stretch. CUSTOMIZED
 chased the winner for almost four furlongs and began to give way. TATUMTOWN refused at the start.

 Footnotes
 KING CAKE behind the first flight after moving toward the inside, continued to save ground the middle half mile, moved out in some traffic in the second turn
 and began to advance three wide into the lane, challenged the two leaders just inside the furlong grounds and proved best under steady handling. A CLAIM
 OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF LOUISIANA LION AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE FIRST TURN WAS QUICKLY
 DISALLOWED. MARDI GRAS MASK prompted the pace while racing four wide, dueled into and through the final turn, showed the way past the furlong
 marker and gave ground grudgingly to the winner late. BUSHIDO SAMURAI vied up front while between rivals for five furlongs, dueled through the final turn
 and upper stretch, weakened the final furlong, saved the show. BEAU ROUGE with the pace while three wide and between rivals for five furlongs, began to
 falter in the far turn. DREWMISTERIO last to leave, raced back early, improved position slightly, never dangerous. LOUISIANA LION in some traffic early,
 void of speed, continued to trail most of the way, never a factor. GATOR TOUGH set or forced the pace along the inside, stopped far turn.

 Footnotes
 SOUTHSIDE SHORTY off a bit slow, moved up steadily into contention outside, engaged the leader nearing the furlong marker from the outside and wore
 that rival down under firm handling to be comfortably clear at the wire. SHOLTZ back off the pace toward the inside, between rivals through the turn, staged
 a late rally up the inside for the place. ALYS APPOINTMENT broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace off the inside, shook clear in the turn, offered brief
 resistance to the winner midstretch, could not keep pace thereafter, caught late for the place. DIPPER PINES pressed the early leader from along the
 inside, fell back into the turn, went evenly in the drive. YOUNG PULVEY lacked speed, angled out sharply to be five wide out of the turn, lacked a late kick
 to make little impact. OPEN UP back off the pace, in some traffic early in the turn, faded through the stretch. FIREDUPREADYTOGO trailed in lacking
 speed, floated out six wide turning for home, failed to rally.
