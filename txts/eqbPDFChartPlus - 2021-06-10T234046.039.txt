 Footnotes
 SHARP HOOQ was outrun to the turn, bid two then three wide to the quarter pole, swung out into the stretch, rallied when set down and closed with a
 strong run to be up in time. RHETT'S IMAGE dueled for the lead outside of NORM'S PLACE and three wide to the stretch, responded when set down,
 battled determinedly to the final strides and just missed. JASON X L stalked the leaders to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then had clear sailing inside
 rivals in the drive, responded to get to terms leaving mid stretch, dug in but also was nipped. FRIDAY HARBOR had no speed, shifted out in the opening
 furlong, raced three then four wide on the turn, swung widest into the stretch and closed fast late. NORM'S PLACE dueled for the lead while off the rail to
 the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was tiring late. RIDEO chased the pace early, got pushed out four wide on the turn and weakened in the final
 furlong.

 PRETTY EMMA was well placed to the half, swung off the rail and rallied three wide leaving the five sixteenths, shot to the front into the stretch and drove
 clear to the line. TELL HER YES was allowed to settle to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but bested
 the rest. SEA MYRTLE was outrun to the half, also was fanned to the four path on the second turn then lacked the needed late response. MENDED pressed
 the pace to the second turn, moved up to duel and briefly held the lead at the quarter pole, was outkicked by the winner to mid stretch and weakened.
 FRENCH TART set the pace to the second turn, got collared by MENDED nearing the stretch and gave way in the drive. TIZMISS had no speed and was
 always outrun.
