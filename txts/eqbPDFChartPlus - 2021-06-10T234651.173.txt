 Footnotes
 ODACHI cleared off to the lead two wide around the first turn, turned back a challenge from WICKED FUN near the quarter-pole, went clear again through
 midstretch, then had enough to keep LAUGHS N KISSES at bay in the closing yards. LAUGHS N KISSES was never far back while two to three wide early,
 cut the corner turning for home, bid outside the winner in deep stretch but ran out of time. SAENGER raced three to four wide around the far turn and rallied
 mildly to earn a share. NAVAL COMMISSION chased the leaders inside and tired after six furlongs. WICKED FUN was caught three to four wide early,
 made a menacing run outside ODACHI to loom a threat approaching the stretch, then flattened out. REGALYA saved ground and was outrun throughout.

 SPICED COMMANDER saved ground pressing the pace to the middle of the turn, slipped through on the rail at the quarter pole, quickly drew off and was
 kept to strong urging. RARE INTEGRITY pressed the pace five-wide, dueled into the stretch and finished well. STEEL BAY pressed the pace, split the
 leaders three-wide to duel at the quarter pole, loomed boldly a furlong out but failed to sustain his bid. JAY WOW was well placed but lacked a late
 response. NOAH GENDA was outrun to the stretch and passed tiring rivals. PONT DE L'ALMA pressed the pace on the outside, dueled four-wide between
 rivals near the quarter pole and tired in the upper stretch. DAVE'S TEXAS LADY was unprepared for the start and no threat. DAISY CREEK sprinted clear,
 set the pace to the quarter pole and gave way.

 MY ANGEL MY SAINT into the final sixteenth, including bumping her hard eighty yards out, and then weakened. BOOKKEEPER MARIE was well placed
 but had only a mild rally. CONNIVING MISS was a bit unruly in the post parade, broke well but was soon outdistanced.

 Footnotes
 THE BABE sprinted clear, responded well when challenged on the backstretch by SENORITA SPARKPLUG, gained a short clear lead in the upper stretch
 and then was all out to prevail in a long battle. SENORITA SPARKPLUG settled in stride, rallied on the backstretch to duel with the winner thereafter and
 wouldn't quit. TICKETOUTOFHERE pressed the early pace, dueled between mares on the backstretch and tired on the second turn. START AGAIN
 hesitated at the start, rallied four-wide on the second turn but failed to sustain her bid. PENNY LOVER broke in the air and trailed.

 quickly grabbed the lead crossing over to the inside, remained clear past the eighth-pole but shortened stride late. BOSS MAN BOB trailed for three furlongs
 two wide, came four wide off the turn and had no rally. BARTLETTS chased the leaders along the inside for three furlongs and tired.

 Footnotes
 MY SOLITUDE was outrun early, angled out three-wide into the second turn, continued on willingly and was up fifty yards out under strong urging.
 SURPRENANTE was outrun early, steadily advanced three-wide on the first turn, continued advancing four-wide on the backstretch, gained command
 entering the stretch and bore out in the middle of the stretch while weakening. TELL ME MORE dueled three-wide into the first turn, dropped back to rate in
 the middle of the pack and lacked a late response. HONOR AND BLESSING dueled inside into the first turn, held a short lead to near the stretch, battled in
 the upper stretch and tired a furlong out. COLOMBE broke well and dueled to the first turn, steadied there between rivals and was no threat. TERRIFIC
 PLAY dueled then pressed the pace to the second turn and gave way. LUCY IN THE SKY had only brief speed, was done after a half and eased through
 the stretch and walked off.
