 Footnotes
 TREBLE stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the top of the stretch, brushed with a foe at the eighth pole and drew off to win handily. DANCE
 PROPOSAL stalked the pace inside, bid between foes at the quarter pole and gained the place late. BREAKING BREAD raced in the five path, then bid in
 the early stretch for the show spot. LA KEY was impeded early, trailed the field, then found room late inside for a bid. VILARO pressed the pace in the three
 path, brushed with the winner at the eighth pole and gave way late. JERSEY HEIST pressed the pace in the two path before giving way late. BOREALIS
 BEAUTY stalked the pace between foes, then faltered on the turn. THE CRAIC stalked the pace in the four path but had no late bid. WHISTLE STOP was
 not a factor. FAIRWAYNGREEN was off awkwardly, then bore out early, led inside, then gave way late.

 Footnotes
 WILL'S PIONEER was clear early and moved to the inside and was ridden out for the win. SLICK SILVER stalked the pace inside, then had no late bid.
 CERUNNOS was reluctant to load, bid four wide at the three-eighths pole, then couldn't gain late. COWBOY CREED pressed the pace in the two path,
 brushed with a foe at the sixteenth pole and faded in the drive. SOARING BIRD was steadied repeatedly while going down the backstretch, then had no late
 bid. SWEET IDI stalked the pace in the three path, brushed with a foe near the sixteenth pole, then had no late bid. FIREHORN raced evenly in the four
 path. GHOST STORY raced evenly. DAHIK saved ground to no avail. WILD POPIT was not a factor. WICKED GEM was off awkwardly. INTO WYNNING
 showed brief speed between foes.
