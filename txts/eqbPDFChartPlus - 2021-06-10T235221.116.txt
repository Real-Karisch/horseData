 Footnotes
 LADY GREATNESS took the lead not long after start, continued on top then came out turning for home, took on inside running rival top stretch, dueled then
 shook free and held off KISS THE CROWN under driving finish. KISS THE CROWN tracked pace along inside then angled out in turn and headed in
 pursuit, moved up in striking range of leader then yielded bit nearing wire. A SQUARE TO SPARE roused forward along rail entering top stretch, dueled for
 lead with eventual winner, could not match strides in late drive but kept up close til the end. LUNA LUNITA raced in contention then came out losing some
 ground turning for home, kept on five wide then evened out. SOUTHERN N' SASSY launched a bid in the turn, set down driving along outside at head of
 lane, needed more for late impact. STAR MILY saved ground along inside, cut the corner entering lane then gaveway. THAT'S A MYTH was off awkwardly
 at the start, raced in the back and failed to rally.

 R CAT DADDY sped to the lead at the start, continued to set the pace, felt rivals edging up closer late in far turn, roused for more entering lane, responded
 and kept sharp and clear under driving finish. DISCO MAN tugged while rated in early stages, settled and cut the corner entering top stretch, angled out few
 paths, kept to drive and held place. PERP stalked though the backstretch, loomed up at the quarter pole to challenge for lead, could not move on with
 eventual winner but kept up close, drifted out late drive and just missed runner up spot. CAMPAIGNER'S GOLD raced off the pace, hustled up along inside
 and gained in late drive. ON CRUISE CONTROL was taken up along inside in the first turn, made move leaving the backstretch, took closer order then
 angled out at head of the lane then evened out in late stages. GANESH raced off the pace, set down driving along outside at head of the lane, needed more
 for serious impact. FRIED BALONEY stalked through early stages, made move up leaving quarter pole to race up close then flattened out in the lane.
 BOLLENTE was slow in early stages, continued in back, made run in stretch and passed tiring foes. PATRICK JOSEPH hustled up along inside three
 furlongs out, showed response then faded. MAD PATRIOT raced near the back and failed to make impact. ANIMAL TRICK was rated midpack through
 backstretch then failed to sustain bid in far turn.
