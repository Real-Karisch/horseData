 Footnotes
 RESTLESS RAMBLER cleared on the lead soon after the start, widened through the turn, came into the lane with his largest advantage then was ridden out
 while never under serious pressure. JACKSON CHROME chased the pace from the three path through the turn, dueled with the next rival through the final
 eighth then inched up late to gain the place spot. SAINT'S BRO chased the pace from the two path through the turn, had no chance at the winner through
 the lane then lost the duel for the place spot inside the sixteenth pole. YOUNG CORBETT was never a factor while saving ground into the lane. MAN OF
 BLUES entered the turn from the four path, dropped closer to the rail through the turn while faltering and was done entering the lane.

 Footnotes
 JILLS PASSION cleared on the lead before the first call, was pressured in late turn, dueled near the eighth pole to the sixteenth pole then edged clear late in
 a game effort. ROCO DIAMOND MINE chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid entering the lane, got to near even terms with an eighth to
 go then faltered under right-handed urging inside of the sixteenth pole. INSTANT CONQUEST was in the four to the three path through the turn, continued
 into the lane from the five path and showed belated interest to gain the show spot. JUST PLAIN KATE chased the pace from the three path through the turn,
 came into the lane gaining momentum, loomed a threat outside the eighth pole then flattened. SHE'S OBVIOUS was never a factor while in the two path
 through the turn. WINGS AND BEER raced in the four path through the turn and made little impact. INDY DANCERS WON bobbled a bit at the start, raced
 along the inside through the turn and into the lane and finished very tired.

 ONEMOREQUICKONE set the pace from the outset, raced in the two path while slowly extending the advantage, quickly widened when asked into the lane
 then was kept busy to the wire while widening. SING ALL NIGHT raced in the three path through the far turn while behind the second flight, swung into the
 lane from the four path and moved up for the distant place spot. GIGGITY tracked the pace while along the inside into the lane then lacked a bid and settled
 for the distant show spot. SHOW'EM POP was in the two path through the turns and was never a menace. NEEDMORE CASH was never a factor while in
 the three path through the turns. BOB'S WIRED chased the winner from the two or three path through the turn and was empty entering the lane. HADDA
 NOTION chased the winner into the turn from the four path then retreated through the lane.

 Footnotes
 DATA BREACH vied for the lead along the inside through the turn, inched to the front straightening in the lane then edged clear outside the eighth pole and
 widened while under minimal urging. MIDWEST JUSTICE vied for the lead two wide with the winner, could not keep up through the lane and settled for
 second best. REVEREND AJ chased the dueling duo through the turn and was well placed into the lane while in the three or four path then lacked the
 needed finishing kick. PEP TALK was in the three path through the turn when well off the pace, swung into the lane from the four path and finished with
 good energy although too late. GOTTSACKER was never a serious threat while racing near the inside through the turn and into the lane. PACIFIC SURF
 was bothered soon after the start, saved ground throughout and was never a menace. LEO was never a factor while in the four path through the turn. G
 NINETEEN never was a factor while in the three path through the turn. IRON AGE raced close up and along the inside into the turn, moved to the five path
 through mid-turn, was widest into the lane and retreated.
