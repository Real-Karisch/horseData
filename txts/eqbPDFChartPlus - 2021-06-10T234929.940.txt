 rail, then eased out in the upper stretch and gained to come up second in the final strides. MISSES KNIGHT chased the pace two wide between horses and
 rounded the turn in the three path, still between horses, then dug in gamely in the stretch and just missed second. TEXAS ALLEY KAT stumbled at the start
 then gave chase well off the pace inside, eased out to take the turn in the four path, then gained down the lane near the rail and finished evenly.
 GREELEY'S BUSTNOUT set the early pace on the outside, was caught near the three-eighths pole, rounded the turn in the five path, then leveled off in the
 stretch. I O INES gave chase well off the pace and was never a factor. BRING IT ON HOME gave chase in about the four path, eased out to take the turn in

 then leveled off in the lane. SALLIE GET UP settled off the pace two wide between horses, made a bid leaving the three-eighths pole and took the turn in

 Footnotes
 WHERE'S BENTLEE moved to the inside entering the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
 about the four path, dug in at the top of the lane to take the nod mid-stretch, raced briefly clear in later yards then held on well. PROSPECTOR ROAD saved
 ground off the pace the opening turn, left the turn in the five path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came out a path to make contact with Zodiac Kid past
 the five sixteenths pole, continued in the five path of the far turn then finished well to take second in the final yards. MAKANA steadied at the rail in the
 vicinity of the nine sixteenths pole then stalked the pace into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, took aim off the rail midway
 on the far turn, had the lead nearing the top of the stretch but was headed a sixteenth away and ceded in later yards. KOWBOY SALUTE came away a step
 slow then saved ground off the early pace, eased out past the nine sixteenths pole and settled outside into the backstretch, started a bid toward the five
 sixteenths pole, improved seven wide through the far turn and finished evenly outside. ZODIAC KID raced just off the early pace in the two and three paths,
 settled six wide into the backstretch, was bumped out to the heels of Where's Bentlee past the five sixteenths pole, raced in the six path rounding the far
 turn and finished evenly. LETS DANCE JACK tapered in through the front stretch to rate a short lead off the rail, moved to the inside at the nine sixteenths
 pole, was pressured for more at the three eighths, yielded the advantage approaching the head of the lane then dropped back through the upper stretch and
 weakened the final sixteenth. WALL ST CHEATSHEET saved ground early while racing well off the pace and never factored. GATTOSING raced in the five
 and six paths into the first turn, moved to the inside leaving the turn and never factored. R AND R BOY came away awkwardly and steadied at the start,
 stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then gave way rounding the far turn. The stewards reviewed claims of
 foul against the rider of Where's Bentlee, lodged by the riders of Zodiac Kid and Prospector Road, then disqualified Prospector Road to fifth place for
 bumping Zodiac Kid out past the five sixteenths pole.

 Footnotes
 After being bumped outward and into Corky Lemon entering the first turn, CATCHER rounded the turn about the five path then settled off the pace into the
 backstretch, started his bid nearing the three eighths pole, progressed in the four path rounding the far turn and dug in at the top of the stretch to get up later
 yards. LONGSTREAK tapered in through the front stretch to stalk the pace two deep, drew to even terms at the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod
 approaching the quarter, contested the edge two deep rounding the far turn and continued with the advantage to late stretch but was outfinished in the final
 yards. CANDY WAY tapered in through the front stretch to rate a slim lead, was headed past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at even terms from that point,
 dropped back a head nearing the quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn, dueled close through the upper
 stretch then flattened stride the final yards. NUKE LALOOSH came out to make sharp contact with Catcher into the first turn then corrected course toward
 the inside past the five eighths pole, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride through the lane. CORKY
 LEMON was bumped out entering the first turn and raced wide through the turn, settled well off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths
 pole, raced six wide on the far turn then flattened out down the lane. LETCHER rated close to the early pace three wide, picked up the chase from the seven
 sixteenths pole then faded rounding the far turn. REAL GLITTER saved ground racing well back. CHIPIT refused. After posting the inquiry, the stewards
 reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Catcher, lodged by the rider of Corky Lemon, but took no action.

 Footnotes
 T REX EXPRESS hustled up and angled in sharply to rate a clear pace inside, rounded all turns on the rail, then drove down the lane under steady
 handling, widening to the wire, and held on well. ROCK N' GOLD stalked the pace inside early then eased out to the four path through the first turn, made a
 bid past the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, but leveled off in the stretch. MARCH WIND, saving ground in the first turn, rated
 off the pace on the inside at a distant fourth, took the clubhouse turn on the rail, made a mild bid past the five-sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn on
 the rail, but flattened out in the stretch. SPA CREEK rated off the pace on the outside and made a bid near the five-sixteenths pole, took the far turn in the
 four path, then leveled off. ROMANTIC CORK rated well off the pace and was never a factor. NOT A SECRET saved ground in the first turn and rated close
 off the pace on the inside but was through after a half. GREAT ROCKET rated well back and never factored.

 Footnotes
 MARGARITA SUNRISE came in at the break to make contact with Pinch This Too, pressured the pace from the inside, contested even terms at the rail
 rounding the turn, took over nearing the top of the lane, dueled clear in the upper stretch and held on under all out handling. RIGHT ON THE MONEY came
 away awkwardly and picked up the chase toward the outside through the backstretch, improved off the rail most of the turn, angled six wide into the stretch
 then lugged in through later yards while finishing well. STEADY HEAT angled in to set a pressured early pace toward mid track, contested even terms two
 deep rounding the turn, yielded the edge approaching the top of the lane then dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened stride the final sixteenth.
 ENVISION SUCCESS settled off the early pace in the four and five paths, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, bore out through the turn, entered the stretch
 widest and finished evenly. BELIEVE THE HEAT chased the pace from the inside, rounded the turn about the three path and finished evenly. PRICELESS
 DANCER chased the pace off the rail, angled in past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail then leveled off down the lane. BOPALONG
 CASSIDY chased the pace while angling in through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path, lost some ground leaving the turn and weakened
 in the stretch. PINCH THIS TOO was bumped at the break and raced well back. GREAT RED DRAGON raced well back toward the outside.
 SPECTACULARWARRIOR raced well off the pace toward the outside.
