 REINE DES ANIMAUX was very reluctant to load, went around the first turn in the two to three path, was unhurried at the back on the outside, traveled
 around the far turn in the two to three path, was roused while swinging six wide into the stretch and improved position. SMILEY BRILEY went three wide on
 the first turn, settled on the outside, rounded the far turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened. KISS
 THAT DUDE raced in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the far turn, hesitated behind a foe near the
 three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. HOPETTE settled nicely on the inside while towards the back, was roused while continuing to save
 ground on the far turn and failed to rally. HOLIDAY SONG raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three then four
 wide on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch and faded. (Rail at 8 Feet)

 OFF CYCLE was well spotted in the front half of the field, saved ground on the turn, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch, rallied into the final
 furlong, took over outside the sixteenth-pole then drew clear under good handling. ALIVIA'S LION bumped lightly with a rival at the start, settled off the pace,
 went three then two wide on the turn, angled out while put to the whip in upper stretch and finished willingly to secure the place. D J SOUL SISTA settled on
 the outside, advanced four then three wide on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths then took the lead, kicked clear into upper stretch, was collared
 inside the furlong marker and weakened but was clear for the show. PRINCESS DINAH was urged along off the pace, began the turn in the two path,
 moved to the four path before the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. KINGSTON TERRACE settled under
 some restraint, dropped back near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. CITY SEDUCTION bumped lightly with a rival at the
 start, was urged along on the outside, went three wide early on the turn then moved to the five path, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

 Footnotes
 ITALIAN CHARM settled on the inside, was roused while shifting three wide into the stretch, chased the leader into the final furlong, made a bid outside the
 sixteenth-pole, brushed with MR. TICKLE late and gamely prevailed. IN THE CHAMBER bobbled at the start, moved in while going to the front, set the pace
 near the inside, was put to a right-handed whip in upper stretch, drifted out some under a left-handed whip at the furlong marker then switched to a
 right-handed whip, drifted out again when switched back to a left-handed whip inside the sixteenth-pole, bothered MR. TICKLE in the process and was
 caught. BROKEN KEY rounded the first turn in the two path, settled near the middle of the field, went around the far turn in the two path, shifted four wide
 into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. MR. TICKLE settled on the inside, was asked on the far turn, rallied into the
 final furlong, moved to the two path while looming a major threat near the sixteenth-pole, steadied when IN THE CHAMBER came out and lost all chance
 then missed the trifecta. GHURAIR went three then two wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the far turn, swung five
 wide into the stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed response. RANSACK was fractious in the gate, rounded
 the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace in hand, went around the far turn in the two path, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, vied into the final furlong
 and weakened. WOODMANS LUCK angled in early, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, raced in the three path on
 the far turn and failed to threaten. TAP THAT WORD went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, raced three wide on the far turn, swung six
 wide into the stretch and failed to respond. ALPHA BRAVO saved ground on the turns and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
 Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run, IN THE CHAMBER was disqualified from second and placed fourth for interference in the final sixteenth.

 FLOROPLUS bumped with SPRING VALUE near the five-eighths pole then moved out, advanced to make a bid on the outside, vied three wide on the turn,
 came under a drive in upper stretch and proved best under strong urging. WYNN TIME set the pace under pressure, vied along the rail on the turn, came
 under a drive in upper stretch, fought on in the final furlong but missed while clear for the place. HOLD ME BLACK pressed the pace on the outside of the
 leader, vied in the two path while between horses on the turn, battled with two opponents under a drive in upper stretch and weakened while able to get the
 show. ZIPP ON BY was rated under a tight hold just off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, shifted three wide into the
 stretch and lacked the needed kick. SPRING VALUE broke out at the start, bumped with FLOROPLUS early, was rated off the pace, came under urging
 leaving the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BERGER was brushed by FLORPLUS near
