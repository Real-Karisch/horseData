 Footnotes
 KING AND HIS COURT raced in mid pack along the rail, was hustled on the far turn, angled out upper stretch, rallied and got up late under a hand ride.
 CAMP CREEK stalked the pace from the rail, angled out upper stretch, rallied, led in the final furlong but was caught late. RED BO pressed the pace on in
 the early going, forced the issue two-wide on the far turn, bid at the top of the stretch, battled, but was passed in the final furlong. FLORIDA WON set the
 pace in hand, was under serious pressured on the far turn, was joined in earnest at the top of the stretch, dueled, was passed in the final furlong and gave
 way. SINE METU, rated in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, launched an all out drive in the stretch but leveled off in the late stages.
 LOOKIN AT BRAVO, off slowly, was rated off the pace, chased along the rail into the stretch and raced gamely to the end. MICK THE CONQUEROR, in
 range, closed three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch, was steadied slightly behind rivals and flattened out.

 Footnotes
 MARITIMECONNECTION stalked the pace, closed three-wide on the far turn, bid upper stretch, edged clear then just held under a drive. BELLA NINA
 raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from three to six-wide on the far turn, rallied outside and just missed. BEAUFILS was rated off the pace, closed to
 mid pack and was hustled two to five-wide through the far turn and finished all out. BLU COLLAR ROMANCE raced four-wide into the first turn, had
 command mid turn, set a pressured pace then gave way grudgingly in the stretch. CRUMLIN GAL settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide late turn and
 chased to the end. FLAT OUT VIXEN bobbled leaving the gate, gained a position in striking range, chased three and four-wide on the far turn then finished
 evenly. COURT REPORTER led briefly then pressed the pace, forced the issue into the far turn, chased into the stretch and evened out. MYSTERY DAY,
 rated off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. ABOGADA, whose rider carried a whip today, settled off the pace,
 came four then three-wide through the Clubhouse turn, closed along the rail on the far turn but flattened out in the stretch.
