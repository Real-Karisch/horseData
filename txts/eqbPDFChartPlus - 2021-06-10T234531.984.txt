 Footnotes
 MR. SPACEMAN stalked the dueling leaders under rating while four wide, took closer order mid turn, shifted out a path and closed under right handed
 rousing to take command in mid stretch, dueled outside a stubborn DUKIN' WITH DALE, switched to his left lead late and prevailed in an extended drive.
 DUKIN' WITH DALE was off a step slow after leaning in and hitting the gate, regrouped and pulled his way to command between rivals, dueled in the two
 path and to the inside LAST CONFESSION, got the best of that one soon into the lane while in the three path, was confronted from his outside by the
 winner and kept on gamely from there to just miss. SLIDE BY YOU , off the pace and removed from the inside, came under a ride leaving the far turn,
 angled out then circled six wide into the lane, loomed boldly leaving the three sixteenths but could only muster up a mild rally in the final furlong. LAST
 CONFESSION , away alertly, disputed the pace three to four wide outside of DUKIN' WITH DALE, failed to kick on after being surrounded in upper stretch
 and weakened. HEY KID , between runners leaving the far turn, angled toward the fence in mid stretch but lacked a solid rally. HARKER flashed speed
 inside, failed to quicken with the leaders leaving the half mile marker and came up empty in the drive.

 Footnotes
 STYLISH NOTION got an engaged in a duel three wide outside of DOMINIC'S PRIDE leaving the five furlong marker, moved out a bit further continuing the
 battle in upper stretch, gained a slim lead soon after and held firm in an extended drive. DOMINIC'S PRIDE , between rivals early, gained a short lead
 leaving the far turn, dueled two to three wide from there and just missed in a sharp effort. SNOW QUEEN , bumped at the break then drifted out before
 being corrected, split rivals moving to contention after a furlong, was under a drive chasing the dueling leaders four wide into the lane but could only
 generate a mild late kick. MADAM ALEX , taken to rate while saving ground, gained when let out in upper stretch, loomed in mid stretch then flattened out.
 SHE BE SASSY , two to three wide while off the pace, dropped to the rail for the stretch run and passed tiring rivals. SWEET GEORGIA N had speed inside
 the top pair then rated back off them leaving the five eighths, stalked in the two path, came under pressure soon into the lane then weakened in the final
 furlong. REAGAN'S FASTPITCH leaned in at the break and bumped with SNOW QUEEN, was floated out a bit as that one drifted, was used wide into the
 far turn, gave chase to the quarter pole then dropped back.

 Footnotes
 WOLFINBARGER lagged off the pace and off the inside, came under a ride leaving the far turn, swung six wide for the drive, closed determinedly under left
 handed encouragement and forged to command in the final yards. FLANKENSTEIN vied in hand outside of RARIFIED AIR, shook clear while being set
 down in upper stretch, extended his advantage in mid stretch, wandered outward in deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. RARIFIED AIR rushed up
 between rivals soon after the break, dueled to the inside of FLANKENSTEIN, came under a ride leaving the five sixteenths, altered out leaving the three
 sixteenths and came back willingly. CELTIC RULER had speed inside, eased back off the dueling leaders nearing the half mile marker, angled out for the
 drive and came up empty. LOOK WITHIN stalked off the rail, raced three wide between foes near the quarter pole, failed to kick on while under urging in
 upper stretch and faded. COLONEL ARGO , a bit reluctant to load, edged up nearing the half mile marker, steadied soon after, angled out and was put to
 pressure, came four to five wide for the drive, altered to the fence leaving the three sixteenths and failed to muster up a solid run. WING FIGHTER chased
 four wide and weakened.

 Footnotes
 STOLEN LOVE , two wide between rivals in a four way pace scramble, responded when put to a drive entering the lane and spurted clear, widened under
 left handed encouragement in mid stretch, wandered outward a bit before being corrected with the right stick and held firm. HENRY THE KING bobbled at
 the break and was off poorly, regrouped and pulled his way forward while well removed from the rail, chased between rivals leaving the three eighths,
 shifted out for the drive and churned on willingly on his left lead to nab the place. CONQUEST SEE YA sat just off the contested pace while saving some
 ground, eased out mid turn, was under pressure chasing into the lane and kept trying between rivals to grab the show. NEGRITO advanced inside rivals
 nearing the five eighths pole and entertained the pace, was caught inside a trio of foes leaving the three eighths, kept on to mid stretch and gave way
 grudgingly. CONCORDIA'S WAY , four deep under rating disputing the pace, drifted out a bit entering the lane, failed to quicken with the winner leaving the
 three sixteenths, chased past the furlong marker and faded. SARATOGA HEATER , five to six wide stalking the pace, was under hearty encouragement mid
 turn but failed to seriously respond. DEMON BUSTER vied three wide between rivals and gave way entering the lane.

 Footnotes
 CAME UP ROSIE , two wide leaving the turn, advanced inside FATUM to take the lead near the sixteenth pole and lasted. BAILEY'S ISLAND , rated back
 shortly after the start, steadied mid way on the turn, swung to the five path entering the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch and rallied late outside horses.
 FATUM , quickly clear, set the pace well off the rail around the turn, was in the three path in the stretch and weakened. SWEET PEACHES , a forward factor
 three wide on the turn, came up empty in the stretch. DUMPSTER DIVA saved ground on the turn, raced along the rail in the stretch and passed tired
 horses. BETTER WAY chased the pace, hugged the inner rail on the turn and gave way. DA'BLUES DANCER , four deep on the turn, gave way. KEYS
 GARBOY was not a factor. MADER BYTHE MINUTE saved ground on the turn, angled out for the drive, failed to rally and steadied lacking room near the
 sixteenth pole.
