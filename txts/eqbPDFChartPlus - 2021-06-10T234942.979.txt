 Footnotes
 EVERYTHING PAZIBLE away without apparent mishap, began the run around the bend three wide but was soon four wide, with the pilot of the runner up
 unable to settle his mount along the inside route, crept up menacingly as three-quarters was being completed, was given his cue and took charge soon
 afterwards, held well in the final stages to fend off the second place finisher. RIDOLFO tugging hard on the left side from gate to wire, alternated between
 the inside route and the two path, was along the former in the lane rallying for the place. MR WONDERFUL shook off a light bump with MISSION
 STATEMENT to dispute the pace with the same foe, down on the rail going about it on the backstretch, edged away leaving the half mile pole, was turned
 loose for the drive as the pressure picked up once more, this time in the form of the eventual winner, fought from between opponents from the head of the
 stretch until midlane, relinquished and backed away. CLONEDSIMMARD strung out four wide to the top of lane, made no impact. FREUDIAN ANALYST
 rode the rail for the first six furlongs, fanned out six wide, becoming the widest of all, from upper to midstretch, launched no serious bids. MISSION
 STATEMENT in with his initial step, made some contact with the top one, went on to contest the pace matched up with that one all the way to conclusion of
 the backstretch, stationed mostly in the two path while doing so, went over to a hand ride after becoming unhitched at the top of the turn, continued to lose
 ground then even more upon reaching the stretch.

 Footnotes
 UNCLE SIGH broke out at the start bumping SAMADI SKY in concert with CALCULATED RISKER who broke inwards, chased four to five wide down the
 backstretch before tucking two to three wide into the turn, advanced on the once clear leader to take command five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide
 into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. SAMADI SKY bumped between foes at the start, chased three then two wide, came under coaxing
 nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide at that station, proved no match for the top one while along for the place honors. WON'T BE MISSED brushed
 the near side stall at the start, chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the turn getting put to coaxing three furlongs
 out, angled five wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show honors. BLUE PIGEON established the front from the get go getting away well
 and crossed to show the way in hand spurting clear from the rest of the field, widened away through the opening half mile and tucked inside into the turn,
 came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths as the field took closer order and began to threaten for the front, got headed at that station, spun just off the
 inside for home and weakened in the stretch. CALCULATED RISKER broke in at the start bumping SAMADI SKY in tandem with UNCLE SIGH, chased four
 to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, offered up a
 mild bid to the eighth pole, couldn't sustain the move and weakened through to the finish.

 Footnotes
 WALKOFF put to a feverish ride springing from the starting gate, was out-sprinted, left the half mile pole having just been briefly, but heavily roused, was
 gradually worked into the three path during the ensuing furlong, came under a drive for good in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, spun four wide
 into the lane, kicked in his best completing the run through the furlong grounds, closed in fast on the lightly urged leader, continued to chop away at the
 defict even with ARI'S NAUGHTY LUCA by now under a drive for the final seventy yards and got the job done at the wire. ARI'S NAUGHTY LUCA broke on
 top and retained the advantage, slid over to the inside route, showed the way, pressured by a pair of foes to the outside for nearly a half, went into the
 stretch and was swtiched over to a light hand ride, left the eighth pole in possession of what turned out to his largest advantage, got put to a drive once the
 winner boldly arrived on the scene inside the sixteenth pole, albeit too late, and wound up getting nailed. BAD SUENO was lightly urged in path two in
 pursuit of the front runners on the backstretch, kept watch towards the back of the pack, swung five wide into the stretch, straightened away and mustered
 up a response sufficient enough to grab the show. INDIGESTION disputed the pace from between rivals in the two path until around the five-sixteenths
 marker before giving way. NINJA DUST three wide entering the turn, was never in it. SUREMONEY lunged right slamming into the side of the starting gate,
 recovered and went to contend from path three as the widest of a threesome for most of the opening half, folded.

 ARGONNE tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, took over command near the quarter pole, swung three wide
 into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and held safe to prevail. HIERARCHY saved ground through the opening bend before racing three then two wide in
 pursuit coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to close in late. FINANCIAL SYSTEM
 broke out at the start and was corrected, chased two to three wide coming under encouragement five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper
 stretch, offered up a bid to the eighth pole, couldn't sustain the move and flattened out in the late going while clear for the show honors. ALL GO established
 the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through sensible splits, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and spun just off
 the inside for home, then weakened in the stretch. DANCE FOR ORO chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded through
 the far turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, tired and was eased through the final furlong. DUBLIN GREEN forwardly placed three wide through the first
 turn, chased four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded through the turn and went two to
 three wide into upper stretch, tired and was not eased through the final eighth.

 Footnotes
 SIMONA at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, sat parked out four wide stalking the front runners, picked up interest as the second split
 was being finalized, tipped one path farther off the inside and after being given her cue, took off in earnest after the leader, shot to the front, emerging at the
 eighth pole as the undisputed leader, drew off, kept to some encouragement to the end. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS was gathered after breaking slightly to
 the outside, was along the inside route on the backstretch getting eased back, tipped into the two path at the top of the turn, narrowed the gap when then let
 out a notch to draft behind the pacesetter, was maneuvered into path six from upper to midstretch, closed in to be along in time to snatch away second.
 VIRADIA took up the chase three wide on the turn, was about as wide being ridden into the lane, proved no match for the winner, then lost the place late.
 MIDNITESALRIGHT stationed in the two path, sparred with ITSJUSTNOTYOURDAY, appeared to poke a head down in front as the half was being
 completed, however with the top one bearing down hard to the outside, yielded to that opponent soon afterwards, steadily backed away in the final furlong.
 SHE'S A LUMBERJANE three wide onto the turn, got sent out into path seven during the stretch run to no avail. THIRD CARD DOWN guided to the rail at
 the half mile pole, was never heard from. JACQUELINE D hung out four to five wide on the bend, tired. ITSJUSTNOTYOURDAY dueled for command from
 the inside until the quarter pole and gave way.

 Footnotes
 TIZ MORNING got hooked up with PRESTO beginning from shortly after the start, gradually made his way to the rail on the backstretch, with the nemesis
 following suit by shifting to the inside and into path two himself after some lanes of separation prior, dueled head to head with the second place finisher from
 the top of the bend until its end, was the first to have its pilot commit to a drive, doing so coming up to the quarter pole, saw their tussle spill over into the
 lane, as they competed with each other on almost dead even terms, exchanging a series of leans while going at it continued onward with gameness to
 prove best. PRESTO broke forwardly placed, was to the outside of the winner but not directly abreast disputing the pace along the backstretch, tucked into
 the two path coming up to the half mile pole, vied with vigour head to head, stepped into the lane and was asked for a little more, made light contact at
 intervals still locked in combat with the winner, never backed off, but got denied. SPICE ROAD took an awkward intial step to the left as the field was sent
 off and running, yet got going rather quickly nevertheless, was set up in the three path, stayed within range of the fighting front runners, got swtiched over to
 a brisk hand ride right after the half had been completed, swung one path farther off the rail into the stretch, kicked into gear well beyond the eighth pole and
 nailed down the show. MEET ME IN L A struck the right side of the starting gate, cut into the two path, took up the chase on the front runners towards the
 back of the pack, got ridden approximately four wide into upper stretch, made some late headway. DARK STORM four wide onto the turn, lacked the
 needed late closing punch. FULLNESS OF TIME a forward factor four wide, gave way. RIGHTEOUSNESS strung out three to four wide on the turn, angled
 six wide coming up to the eighth pole, had no offering. LOOKIN AT ROSES dragged towards the two path approaching the conclusion of the backstretch,
 appeared green, came about a couple of paths wider onto the top of lane, then went down it greenly too. DR. ALBERT at over near the rail until the end of
 the bend, strolled into the lane appearing choppy-gaited, was eased then pulled up by midstretch, walked off the track without need of outside assistance.

 Footnotes
 MISS HOT STONES established the front and crossed to show the way in hand from the two path, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing
 nearing the quarter pole before being set down cornering just off the inside into upper stretch, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. SHE'S TROUBLE
 came in shortly after the start bumping two to three times with NOT ABOUT THE NAIL, jostled foe position before chasing three wide in closest aim of the
 leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second
 best. FOREVER DAISY pulled inside while under rating down the backstretch and into the turn, took to the two path at the half mile pole, tipped three wide
 at the five-sixteenths put to encouragement, swung four wide for home and weakened. NOT ABOUT THE NAIL got bumped after the start by SHE'S
 TROUBLE two to three times as that foe jostled for position, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued five wide for home and tired.
 EXCEED THE GOAL four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, continued four wide into upper stretch and tired. GENTLE ANNIE three
 wide down the backstretch, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under urging three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and made
 no impact. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of NOT ABOUT THE NAIL alleging interference at the start against MISS HOT STONES which was
 reviewed and dismissed prior to the race being declared official.

 Footnotes
 FIRE KEY sparred for the top from the two path for much of the trip leading up to the half mile pole, with MRS. RAMONA G. being the competition for the
 lead, saw that rival take up the role of a stalker by the top of the turn, had the pressure get cranked up as the half was being completed and was asked for a
 response, inched away to her largest lead during the ensuing furlong, came under heavy pressure from a pair of opponents to the outside in the final
 seventy yards, dug in gamely to prevail. BROADWAY RUN off the inside throughout, pursued the front runners from path three, angled one path farther off
 the rail into the lane, rallied in tenadem with FEAR NO EVIL leaving the sixteenth pole, loomed boldly but couldn't nail the gutsy winner. FEAR NO EVIL was
 moved into the three path after the field had been sent off and running, was well rated stalking the winner, was given her cue settling onto the head of the
 stretch, rallied teamed up with the runner up as each whittled away at the defict late, doing so from between horses, came up short. MRS. RAMONA G.
 stationed along the rail at the time, vied with the top one for command during the initial stages, was allowed to ease back a bit approaching the conclusion of
 the backstretch, tipped slightly to the outside, then drafted off the leader's shoulder, was set down after the half had rattled off, put in a good run before
 flattening out in the final sixteenth. ALBERTVILLE (GER) strung out three to four wide on the turn, angled five wide into the lane, made no discernable
 headway then was reported after the race to have bled. MISERICORDIA (GB) failed to fire off a ground-saving journey.
