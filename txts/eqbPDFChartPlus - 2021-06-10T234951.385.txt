 leader and raced evenly on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. VICTORIA PLACE set the pace but was headed on
 the far turn and had nothing left. MERCURY RISING was in touch early but chased on the far turn and was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 HOMBRE NATURAL stalked the leader, forced the pace on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. BIG BAND
 BENNY showed speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort.
 BALDUR was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the six path through the stretch finished well. TOO MANY EGBERT'S broke awkwardly
 and was roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. MOON DOGGIE was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and
 gained gradually through the stretch. SPIN WILD had no speed, showed little and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. A CLAIM OF
 FOUL BY THE RIDER ON BIG BAND BENNY AGAINST HOMBRE NATURAL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS NOT
 ALLOWED.

 SECRETARIATS HONOR tracked from the outside, was a factor from the three path on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew off.
 KHAWLAH had no speed, gained ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. DUBHE was in touch and raced evenly
 from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. ICRYWHENI'MDRUNK stalked from the inside and had a bid
 on the turn but was outfinished. BID'S KID was in mid pack and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.
 RING FOR ESSA was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but leveled off. ADIOS MIA was unhurried early, showed little and was not a factor. ALERT
 KITTEN was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally. DIVINE NECTAR was well back and showed
 nothing in a dull effort. NOBLE ASSET set the pace and had the lead on the turn but from the nine path at the top of the stretch was empty.

 Footnotes
 MARTINKELLY stalked the early leader, forced the pace on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. CLASSIC DANIEL set the
 pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. UNCLE LOU was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but
 from the seven path at the top of the stretch needed more. HOPE VISION was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and was up for a share.
 SIGNATURE TWIRL was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was the best of the rest. ATHENA'S LEGACY was well back and gained ground on the
 turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch was no threat. CIMINIO was in mid pack and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the
 stretch had no response. BARNESLAND was up close early but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.
 BERKELEY BOY had no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact. RIGHTFROMTHE
 GECKO was in range early but lost ground on the turn and from the nine path at the top of the stretch was empty.
