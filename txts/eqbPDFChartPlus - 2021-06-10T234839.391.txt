 Footnotes
 RAH RAH RALEIGH rated just off leader to turn, took over and was all out through the stretch run and lasted to the wire. BOSA FLOW well placed while
 never far back, rallied too late and missed at the wire. SIR STEVIEBOY had an inside run to the quarter pole, angled out for clear run with only a mild late
 gain. PEG'S PRINCE bore out at the start, raced evenly and lacked a late response when needed. MILLSTONE GRIT never a menace. COWBOY ZEKE
 showed speed to the quarter pole but gave in and dropped back. LIKELY TO REIGN threw his head at the start while never a factor.

 HESAWRECKINGBALL tracked leader to the turn, took over past the quarter pole and cleared off in the drive. ULTIMATE CHOICE was slow early, rushed
 inside, waited on the turn but had no gain when clear through the stretch run. MR. WALLY good break for the lead, overtaken into turn but faltered in the late
 going. COME ON BERT well placed while never far back but failed to respond when needed in the drive. CHRISTOPHER K hopped at the start and only
 improved position while never a threat. MORNINGLOVER RAMBO was through after a half from off rail into stretch. BLACK RUM failed to menace. UNCLE
 JIMMY never a factor.

 SWEET REEF well rated off pace, rallied after a half and drew off as much the best. GENERALSDOTTIR no speed to far turn, rallied widest into the stretch
 to be along for place late RILLA good speed for a half but began to weaken and settled for the show spot. HERMOSA VAQUERA raced evenly to the far
 turn but failed to respond through the stretch run. SWEET ROCK reared in the gate unseating rider then never a real menace once the gate sprung.
 SCENTSATION chased leader for a half before giving way and dropping back. NOT SIMPLY SIMON good position for three quarters but gave way soon
 after. LADY CHANDLER never a factor.
