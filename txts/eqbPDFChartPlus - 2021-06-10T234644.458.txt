 between rivals early, chased inside, bid along the rail in the stretch and was outfinished. ARTIE B GOOD settled outside then angled in a bit off the rail to
 the stretch, came out in midstretch and also found his best stride late. ERIC THE TROJAN chased three deep, came four wide into the stretch and could not
 quite summon the needed late kick. GRAZEN SKY a bit slow to begin, saved ground chasing the pace throughout and lacked a rally. ACCEPTANCE broke
 in the air and slowly, pulled early while off the rail, swung four wide into the stretch and was not a threat. SIGUR ROS dueled three deep then four wide into

 Footnotes
 ALMOST REALITY saved ground stalking the pace, came out in upper stretch, bid outside the runner-up under some urging past the eighth pole, gained a
 slim advantage in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. X S GOLD pulled her way to the early lead, angled in and set the pace inside under some restraint,
 fought back inside the winner in the final furlong and went willingly to the end. SEA SMOKE stalked outside the winner then off the rail to the stretch and
 held third. MIZZEN GLORY chased between horses then a bit off the rail, continued inside on the second turn and into the stretch, came out in midstretch
 and was edged for the show between foes late. CLEARLY GONE pulled early and steadied into the first turn, settled a bit off the rail, split horses leaving the
 second turn, came out in the stretch and put in a late bid at a minor award. MOONSHINE ANNIE stalked three deep on the first turn then outside a rival to
 the stretch and lacked the needed rally. VERONICA BAY saved ground chasing the pace, continued inside in the stretch and did not rally. EASYDOES IT
 PLEASE broke a bit slowly, settled three deep then outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.
