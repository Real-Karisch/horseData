 Footnotes
 SKIP'S SONG, reserved off the second flight while angling inside early, switched out after a half, advanced on the leaders three wide entering the far turn to
 challenge for command racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage and drove clear. FRIGID joined the pace outside foes racing to the first turn,
 pressed the issue outside a rival to the far turn to gain a narrow advantage but proved no match for the winner. LIL' SHOPPER, eased off the first flight to
 track those foes along the inside for five furlongs, shifted out nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to earn a share. KISS ME LILY settled along
 the inside tracking well off the second flight, then made some belated progress while angling out in late stages. DE QUEEN, urged to dispute the pace
 inside rivals from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. NOTORIOUS GAL, restless in the gate, was off a bit slowly, settled outside foes in
 the last flight and proved no threat. MORNING BELLE, caught a bit wide early racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders in second flight to the far turn and
 came up empty nearing upper stretch. HONDURAS PRIDE dropped out early.

 Footnotes
 FLIGHT RISK, held up just the pacesetter racing in close quarters between foes into the first turn, continued under firm rating stalking just off the first flight a
 bit off the inside through the backstretch, was prompted to split foes racing into the far turn to press the issue outside a rival and went clear in the stretch
 under firm right handed pressure. COLOMBARD broke sharply, angled in setting the pace on a narrow margin along the rail, dueled for command into upper
 stretch but proved only second best. DREAMER'S POINT, pulling a bit inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter in close quarters racing into the first turn,
 tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, angled out three wide racing into upper stretch but had no late bid. POWERFUL THIRST, reserved off the
 second flight early, advanced five wide nearing the far turn to lodge a brief bid but soon flattened out. GOLDEN BULLET, caught four wide racing into the
 first turn, tracked the pace outside rivals in second flight and steadily faded between foes in that path on the far turn. LUCKY INFERNO, reserved last, never
 menaced. CHARLIE'S SCHILLER, urged three wide between foes into the first turn to gain terms with the pacesetter, pressed the issue to the far turn and
 gave way.

 SANDY SANGRIA, carried inwards at the break, was quickly righted, then urged to the lead along the rail in the opening stages, dueled for command into
 the stretch in a prolonged drive and just held MY GIRL ROCKET to the end under energetic handling. The latter angled inwards to prompt the pace outside
 the eventual winner, pressed the issue into upper stretch in a protracted skirmish but was just outfinished. STARVANA angled inwards early to track the
 leaders inside a rival in second flight but had no closing bid. PRETTI SAVI ducked in at the start momentarily impeding the eventual winner, was collected to
 track off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and gained some position while no real threat. TIZ A SHARPIE tracked off the
 second flight outside a rival, shifted three deep into upper stretch but had no rally. FRUGAL BETTY tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, was
 fanned four wide into the lane and faded. HEFFINGTON broke slowly, settled, swung five wide racing into the lane but made no impact. PRADO'S TRUST
 swerved out at the start and soon dropped out. NOHO proved no factor.

 CATS HONOR, reserved inside early, advanced with a sharp move to split foes nearing upper stretch, swung outside the leaders and continued with a
 sustained response to gain a clear advantage under pressure. FLORIDA BIRD, caught five wide in the opening stages, angled in pressing the pace outside
 a rival, went clear into upper stretch but proved no match. AUNT GAYLE settled outside foes early, shifted five wide racing into upper stretch to make
 belated progress. SHE'S TOO COOL, held up avoiding close quarters early, advanced to loom five wide nearing upper stretch but flattened out. SHE'S
 UNDAWNTED tracked between foes in second flight, was urged to challenge three deep nearing upper stretch but soon came up empty. DIRTY DIXIE
 ROAD tracked outside foes in second flight, lodged a brief bid between rivals nearing the lane while caught in close quarters and proved empty in the drive.
 SHE'S A QUEEN, urged to a forward placing along the rail tracking just off the leaders, gave way into the stretch. MISS BARHAM, urged to the lead while
 angling inside, dueled for command racing into the turn and soon gave way. SEASIDE SURPRISE was a brief factor four wide early but soon retreated.
 JEAN'S BEAUTY trailed.

 Footnotes
 HARDLY A SECRET, a bit wide early, angled inwards while being rated out of striking distance, made a steady advance inside foes to gain terms with the
 pacesetter while switching outside that foe nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage, went clear under pressure and was gathered up nearing the wire.
 CURLIN ROAD, reserved along the inside in early stages, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch while being roused to advance and proved best of the
 others. GIANT INFLUENCE switched outside the first flight tracking just off those foes under light reserve, was urged to advance four wide racing into the far
 turn but lacked the needed final kick. BUBBAS DIXIE settled in the last flight inside foes, saved ground throughout and made an effort to, improve position
 late. SOUL P SAY, urged to the lead outside foes racing to the first turn, angled to the rail to set the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command leaving
 the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. WHOLE LOTTA LUCK settled outside foes in the opening half and continued evenly four wide between foes
 late. SIDAVI settled outside foes in the last flight early, was fanned five wide into the stretch but proved no threat. WHERE'S THE WIDGET, urged between
 foes from the outset prompting the pace, lost ground to the pacesetter on the far turn and emptied out into the lane. ALL ABOUT ASHLEY, urged three wide
 into the backstretch prompting the pace, gave way on the far turn.

 LAST HEART, urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the outset into the turn, continued with a grudging effort inside a rival to narrowly prevail in an all
 out drive. RI RI FRENCH FRY, prominent three wide in the opening stages, pressed the pace outside the eventual winner to midstretch on a narrow
 advantage and was just outfinished. HESLUCK tracked off the first flight racing to the turn, split foes into upper stretch and improved position. CALL ME
 DERBY tracked the pace outside a rival in second flight, advanced to briefly loom three wide nearing upper stretch but flattened out midstretch. BLU BLAZE
 angled inside tracking off the second flight, saved ground to the lane and continued evenly. DELTA REWARD settled outside foes and never gained
 contention. GRAHAMSTAN settled between foes and proved no threat. MAJOR BIZKIT ducked in the gap leaving the gate and never menaced thereafter.
 STORM'S A SUSPECT, urged between foes disputing the pace into the turn, gave way early. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY, caught five wide early, failed to menace.
 GOTTA B SCRAPPY dropped out early.

 Footnotes
 PEACHY tracked just off the second flight under firm rating in the opening quarter, gained position between foes on the turn, shifted out three wide in upper
 stretch and produced a sustained response under brisk left handed pressure to wrest command and go clear in time while being gathered up nearing the
 wire. POINT STREAK, urged to the lead from between foes, angled to the inside setting the pace, held sway to upper stretch but proved no match when
 confronted by the winner. SAY IT SOFTLY, forwardly placed three deep between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, angled inwards on the turn to lodge a
 brief bid nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. BETWEEN THE ARCHES tracked off the second flight under rating to the turn, split foes racing into the
 lane to gain position but made no impression. SILVER TURNS GOLD settled last and passed tiring rivals. C C'S BABY GIRL, urged to prompt the
 pacesetter along the inside, faded early. LUCKY BE A LADY vied briefly between foes, emptied out early. LINDA LISTEN, forwardly placed four wide in the
 opening stages, gave way abruptly racing into the turn.

 Footnotes
 BLESSED AGAIN moved to the fore along the rail in the opening stages to prompt the pace inside foes to the backstretch, went clear racing into the far turn,
 then widened her advantage to the end under hand urging while her rider flashed his whip right handed. PERFECT REINS was settled last while angling to
 the inside racing to the backstretch, advanced to contention along the rail entering the far turn, continued in pursuit of the winner into upper stretch but
 quickly proved no match. SHEESA PONTIAC, urged to terms pressing a rival's pace racing into the backstretch, lost ground to the winner entering the far
 turn and gave way nearing the lane. AGI'S CAIT, pulling between foes in second flight, became rank under restraint while drifting out three deep into the first
 turn floating out MARATHON QUEEN, continued in that path to the backstretch and faded early. MARATHON QUEEN, fanned four wide racing into the first
 turn tracking off the first flight, continued outside foes to the far turn but had no closing bid. BELLA ALICITA tracked off the first flight near the inside to the
 backstretch and dropped out after a half.

 JAPEDO angled to the rail in the opening stages tracking just off the first flight to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn to bid for command between
 foes just off the inside entering upper stretch, disputed the issue in a protracted skirmish to late stages, then ducked out under brisk left handed pressure
 bumping JUST A COINKYDINK to gain a narrow advantage in time. The latter was switched out racing into the first turn to track the leaders between foes in
 second flight, advanced on terms with JAPEDO nearing upper stretch to bid three deep for command, struck the front midstretch while continuing in
 prolonged drive, but lost some momentum when bumped by that rival nearing the wire. IT'S BELLAMY TIME tracked off the second flight along the inside,
 advanced to contention along the rail on the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and finished willingly to close the gap on the top pair. POP LIFE
 settled between foes, angled four wide nearing the lane gaining position but had no final kick. HAMAZING VISION, bumped, then forced into EUROWAY at
 the start, settled outside foes to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. CADDO DADDO broke inwards bumping HAMAZING VISION, was urged four
 wide into the backstretch to gain a position the second flight, gained some position racing into the far turn outside foes but came up empty in the drive. CAT
 GOT EVEN, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset, angled to the rail nearing the backstretch and gave way early. EUROWAY, bumped at
 the start, settled last and failed to menace. P C SUSPECT, urged three wide between foes pressing the pace into the first turn, gained a brief lead after a
 half while angling to the inside, but faltered nearing upper stretch. C H JAY was hustled four deep into the first turn forcing the pace to gain a narrow
 advantage entering the backstretch and emptied out after a half. MOON DOG SPOT tracked the leaders three wide between foes to the backstretch and
 retreated early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN LATE STRETCH AND DISQUALIFIED
 JAPEDO FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SECOND.
