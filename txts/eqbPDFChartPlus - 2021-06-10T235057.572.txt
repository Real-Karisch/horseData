 Footnotes
 SHE'S PRETTY LUCKY settled in hand, ranged into striking distance four wide, came to level terms a furlong out, wore down FIRST ALTERNATE and
 edged clear in the final yards. FIRST ALTERNATE opened clear to set the pace toward the inside, was collared on the second turn, fought on doggedly but
 was unable to resist the winner. GO GOOGLE YOURSELF was unhurried into stride, tucked in to save ground, moved into contention on the second turn,
 shifted out entering the stretch, but flattened in the drive and settled for the minor award. AMERICA'S TALE was close up to the outside of pacesetter FIRST
 ALTERNATE through the opening half, moved up to engage that one on the second turn, but weakened between rivals entering the stretch and faded.
 TURBO SHAFT saved ground to no avail. KRAM came away a step slow, was hard to place between runners, leveled into stride three deep, but lacked a
 response when called upon.

 Footnotes
 BUGLE NOTES tracked four wide, launched a bold bid entering the stretch, caught BUENO BUENO BUENO with a furlong to run, came in a bit tightening
 up that one, was straightened away and shook clear late. BUENO BUENO BUENO came in and bumped JEFAZO leaving the chute, vied for between
 horses, fought on through a long drive, was forced in a step when BUGLE NOTES came in, was unable to go on with the winner, but clearly held the place.
 ENCINITAS broke a step slow, was unhurried well back, angled out entering the stretch, kicked on well to earn the show, but was left with too much to do.
 JEFAZO was jostled between horses leaving the chute, settled in the front pack, came three wide, was floated out further in the final furlong and weakened.
 INDUSTRIALIST was bumped early, moved up along the inside, but tired entering the stretch and faded. CUMMINGS was away alertly, angled in to set the
 pace, was headed entering the stretch, drifted about as he tired and retreated. KEROS contended between foes to the stretch and dropped out. SHARKY'S
 LEDGER was slow into stride and was never a factor.

 MIA MISCHIEF disputed the pace off of the inside, edged clear entering the stretch, kept on well under stern urging and held sway. TALK VEUVE TO ME
 attended the pace in hand, commenced a bold bid four wide, was unable to best the determined winner, but continued on well to clearly prove the best of
 the rest. GAS STATION SUSHI settled four wide, swept into contention through the turn, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened and settled for
 the minor award. SALT BAE contended toward the inside to the stretch, but lacked a response when called upon. CRIMINAL MISCHIEF was unhurried,
 came four wide and finished with a belated improvement. HOLD HER TIGHT was allowed to settle, came five wide but failed to make headway. AMY'S
 CHALLENGE contested the pace along the inside through the turn and dropped out.

 WILL CALL settled between rivals, came under a ride with five-sixteenths to run, angled out entering the stretch, was forced to tipped out further when
 BUCCHERO was bumped and pushed out, quickened once clear, reeled in the leaders and kicked away late. KID PERFECT tucked in to save ground,
 shifted out entering the stretch, split horses to make a bold bid, kept on well but was unable to go on with the winner. BUCCHERO stalked the pace,
 launched his bid five wide, was bumped and carried out when VISION PERFECT came out near the three-sixteenths pole, recovered quickly and came to
 level terms a furlong from home, but flattened and settled for the show. DELECTATION (GB) settled along the hedge, angled out leaving the turn to
 commence his run, finished willingly and was making up ground. FRISKY MAGICIAN was unhurried into stride, came five wide, angled out further, lacked
 room and angled back toward the inside in the final furlong and improved position. VISION PERFECT stalked the pace three deep, came four wide to make
 his bid, came out and broadsided BUCCHERO entering the stretch, stayed on to the final furlong and succumbed. SONIC BOOM went wide, finished with a
 mild improvement, but failed to threaten. RISER contested the pace between runners, then along the shrub, but came up empty in the final furlong and
 faded. LATENT REVENGE was away alertly, disputed the pace three wide to the final furlong and caved. RESTLESS RAMBLER vied for the lead along the
 inside, but stopped before going a half.

 Footnotes
 DEVINE MISCHIEF set the pressured pace off of the inside, dug in to meet the bid of SHE'S THE BERRIES a furlong out, shook off that one and kicked
 clear. SHE'S THE BERRIES stalked the pace four deep, launched a bold bid leaving the turn, drew even with a furlong to run, but was unable to match
 strides with the winner. UPSET BREWING settled between horses, angled in entering the stretch, got through and finished willingly to earn the show. MAHO
 BAY contended between horses, angled out entering the stretch, but failed to make headway. ENRAGE was allowed to settle, rallied between horses but
 failed to seriously threaten. ELECTRIC FOREST was in tight leaving the chute, settled in the back of the pack, finished with a belated improvement, but was
 never a factor. BEAUTIFUL STREET prompted the pace three wide, but faltered between horses entering the stretch and faded. SWORN SILENCE was
 allowed to settle, went wide and failed to threaten. C P QUALITY pressed the pace along the inside, but came up empty leaving the turn and dropped out.
 SAINTS' GIRL was bumped and forced in leaving the chute, steadied to avoid hitting the rail extention, settled at the tail of the field and never recovered.

 Footnotes
 MONOMOY GIRL shadowed the leader three deep, took over into the second turn, shook clear and settled into the lane in command, braced for the bid of
 WONDER GADOT nearing the eighth marker, came out a bit brushing that one repeatedly in the drive and held stubbornly. WONDER GADOT settled in
 hand five wide, took a run at MONOMOY GIRL leaving the second turn, came to her throat latch a furlong out, brushed with that one in the drive and was
 unable to best the determined winner. MIDNIGHT BISOU settled off of the inside, moved out four wide on the second turn, circled into the stretch seven
 wide, kicked on well late but settled for the show. ESKIMO KISSES was allowed to settle, angled to the rail to save ground, commenced her run three
 furlongs from home, steadied nearing the quarter pole, was quickly back into stride, got through and soldiered on through the drive. CHOCOLATE MARTINI
 settled in hand toward the inside, took closer order through the second turn, got through but flattened. SASSY SIENNA was forwardly placed along the
 inside, tipped out between horses leaving the second turn but weakened in the final furlong and faded. COACH ROCKS was close up along the inside,
 worked her way out with a quarter to go but came up empty once straightened and gave way. KELLY'S HUMOR settled off of the inside, angled out entering
 the stretch but failed to make headway. HEAVENHASMYNIKKI was unhurried into stride, tucked in at once, got through and finished with a belated
 improvement. CLASSY ACT contended between runners, was fanned wide into the stretch and retreated. MY MISS LILLY was allowed to settle while hung
 wide but lacked a response when called upon. PATRONA MARGARITA was allowed to settle five wide, steadied between horses near the seven-sixteenths
 pole and showed little thereafter. RAYYA broke awkwardly, went wide and never recovered. TAKE CHARGE PAULA set the pace between horses, was
 headed into the second turn, stopped abruptly with three furlongs to run, quickly dropped back through the field and was eased to the wire but walked off.
 The jockey of WONDER GADOT lodged an objection against MONOMOY GIRL for alleged interference through the final sixteenth, following the Stewards
 review there was no change to the order of finish.
