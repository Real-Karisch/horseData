 rhythm through sensible splits, shook away through the latter portion of the turn, got roused spinning just off the inside for home and went clear under a

 Footnotes
 SAL THE TURTLE cut over towards the inside shortly after the start, got let out a notch abandoning the inside route midpoint on the turn, continued his
 chase on the leader, a bit too far back however to make its presence felt, commenced the stretch approiximately three wide, responded when given his cue,
 taking charge by the furlong marker, kicked clear under a light drive. GRANDVIEW underwent a ground-saving journey, unleashed a rail rally once into the
 stretch good enough to claim the place. THREE TO THIRTEEN lost valuable ground and momentum getting checked shifting closer to the rail soon after the
 start, wound up angling all the way to the four path before accorded an opportunity to settle back into stride, stepped onto the turn from the two path, moved
 inward in time to cut the corner into the stretch, altered back into the two path in midlane and finished well enough to wear down BREEZE BURNER for
 third. BREEZE BURNER broke on top and maintained control, slid over closer to the rail approaching the end of the backstretch, was coaxed along showing
 the way on an open lead, was more in the two path than before when set down for the drive at the head of the stretch, yielded to the winner without putting
 up much of a fuss then backed away in a steadfast manner. CINDERELA EL CROME two wide and put to a drive on the turn, tired.

 Footnotes
 WAR CANOE contently took the two path during the initial half, picked up interest getting sent wider after departing backstretch, was three wide at the top of
 the turn two but four wide spinning off it, worked its way to the front from upper to midlane then drew away. J C MY WAY was rated along in the two path
 stalking the pacesetter, headed that opponent in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, was put to encouragement settling into upper stretch,
 proved no match when confronted by the top one, held on long enough to win the place photo. CELTIC SERENADE hung out four wide on the clubhouse
 bend, launched itself into contention with a sustained a run in the three path on the far turn, having come under a brisk ride by the five-sixteenths marker,
 maintained enough of the momentum after entering the stretch to miss out on place honors. LA DAMA DE HIERRO took up the chase two wide and came
 up empty in the final furlong. BUTTON PUSHER three wide on the clubhouse bend, was one path closer to the rail but between rivals on the subsequent
 one, lacked the necessary stretch response. PURE GEMMZ saved ground for six furlongs, shifted out into path four wide the first half of the stretch run but
 made no headway. LITTLE MARY ELLEN took the inside route for six furlongs, angled to the outside to elude a retreating CHATEAU LAFITE heading
 home, had no impact afterwards. CONGAREES KEY cut over sharprly to the rail nearing the conclusion of the homestretch, stayed put for three-quarters,
 wandered out five wide from the top of the lane to midstretch, had no offering. DISTINCTIVE DYNA raced three wide on both turns and gave way.
 CHATEAU LAFITE showed the way from the inside until the five-sixteenths marker and wilted.

 DAISY CUTTER just off the inside near the rear, tipped three wide at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide
 into upper stretch, rallied to poke a nose in front a furlong out, steadily inched away through the final sixteenth to prevail. BOMBSHELL three then two wide
 through the first turn, attended the pace from the two path in hand until put to light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced to issue a challenge swinging
 three wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, dug in under threat and was headed a furlong out, fought on inside to secure the place
 honors. FAMILYOFROSES coaxed from the gate, saved ground at the rear until taken to the three path half a mile from home, came under a ride midway
 on the far turn, angled six wide at the head of the stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors while weakening in the late going. NOT TAKEN
 tracked just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing three wide three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
 drive. HOLD ON MOMMA pulled on the bit early on eager while in hand on the pace inside, settled midway down the backstretch given some rein to work
 with, came under increasing pressure nearing the quarter pole, swung just off the inside for home under a drive, yielded command straightened away and
 weakened through to the finish. MA CAN DO IT saved ground in aim of the front, came under coaxing just off the inside with five-sixteenths to run, angled
 three to four wide at the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 TIZQUICK broke on top and maintained the advantage, got sent over to the inside, carved out the pace being attended by PUT IT FORWARD out in path
 two, was asked for a bit more after completing three-quarters, scampered away during the ensuing furlong then stayed comfortably in the clear. BRANDED
 HAND three wide on the first turn, was closer to the rail on the next one, got cued up angling four wide into the stretch, rallied well enough to garner the
 place. YAKOV mostly in the three path on both turns, got outfinished. SWIVEL left the inside route at the half mile pole, went about from the top of the
 second bend to its end three wide, was maneunved outward from the head of the stretch to midlane until seven wide, closed in for the last major check
 despite never posing a threat. RIVER OF MAGIC sat reserved two wide for six furlongs, swung slightly wider into the lane and failed to muster up a
 response. PUT IT FORWARD stalked the winner from the two path for six furlongs and gave way. CHARITABLE raced two wide to the quarters pole to no
 avail. FINDING CANDY saved ground and faltered. BAMBISFROSTYRACER travelled three wide on the turn, continued from off the inside but closer to the
 rail on the far turn, came four wide into the strech and came up empty. BLUE PIGEON pocketed behind the winner for trhee-quarters, faded.

 Footnotes
 ROMAN CERES was hand urged to secure the advantage, set the pace, being shadowed by LAKESIDE SUNSET to the outside, was let out for the drive
 home, felt heavy pressure throughout the stretch but gamely reached the wire in time to prevail. PRETTY ENUFF was brushed at the break, travelled three
 wide on the turn, swung one path wider into the lane, inched inward and into close proxinity to the heels of another, that being LITTLE BEAR CAT, in the
 vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker and was steadied, recovered in short order and got tipped to the outside, rallied willingly but got nosed. LITTLE BEAR
 CAT stepped off the backstretch from the four path, went after the winner with good determination but was ultimately held at bay. NON FINISCE MAI within
 range two wide and between rivals on the turn, lacked the needed late response. BIG MARA made some contact with the runner up after losing its footing
 springing from the gate, was quickly sent to the rail, tracked the front runners pulling a bit on the bit during the early going, had sufficient room to launch a
 rally down the stretch but fell short of putting one together. WOODVILLE went three wide on the turn and made no impact. SPLENDID GOLD three wide on
 the turn, left it by angling six wide, had no rally. LAKESIDE SUNSET settled into the two path after the start, sparred with the winner until deep into the
 furlong grounds then gave way.

 corner into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick for the place honors. CAUSEWAY CUTIE four then three wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing with
 seven-sixteenths to go, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MAMA'S RED HAT bumped at the start by MOOD SWING who
 broke outwards, chased the pace along the inside coming under encouragement three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch,

 wide for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. SUMMER FASHION off a beat slow, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, came under
 urging at the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, passed tired foes. HOKIE FEVER chased five to six wide under a ride from three furlongs
