 TIZ MY RIGHT settled off the pace, chased angling from the rail to four-wide on the turn, rallied and was just up, driving. BETWIXTING forced the pace, bid
 near the turn, moved clear quickly, widened in the stretch but was caught on the wire. ADORE ME raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to
 three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and was game to the end. QUEEN ANDHER COURT broke outward and bumped ELI'S FORTUNE, settled in
 mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn, was alongside the eventual winner in the stretch but was outkicked. SOUPER PECAN raced in mid pack,
 was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely, but late. MERINO WOOL, in range, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the
 turn but evened out mid stretch. TIMBERLEA settled off the pace, was hustled four to six-wide on the turn then rallied willingly. ELI'S FORTUNE, bumped at
 the start, had the lead on the gap, was joined approaching the turn, was quickly headed, chased to the stretch then evened out mid stretch. RING IN
 SILENCE broke inward and settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn but lacked a rally. NO LIMIT BABE stalked the pace, was hustled

 Footnotes
 EL CHAIRMAN sat in mid pack early, came circling the front runners with a two to five wide rally by the quarter pole, reached the front at the eighth pole and
 widened from that point. MONEY MATTERS was in mid pack and wide down the backstretch, came three to four wide with the winner outside of him by the
 quarter pole, could not match that one's energy but did manage to go by the rest late for the place spot despite being on his wrong lead.
 ITMAKESMEWONDER took back to stalk the early duelers, was two to three wide behind the frontrunners turning for home, was shut off in upper stretch
 when trying to split rivals but gathered up and re-rallied to manage a show finish. GHOST ISLAND was off the pace and in the two path on the turn, angling
 out in upper stretch and closing best of all in the final furlong. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST was allowed to take the lead early along the inside by a rival who
 pressed and headed him by the quarter pole, staying on gamely when in tight in upper stretch, fading the final sixteenth. ODDS GET EVEN lugged in early,
 allowed a rival to lead, pressed and passed that one by the quarter pole, lugged in midstretch causing difficulty for two foes, was pulled up after the finish
 and vanned off. MR. RAINBOW hopped in the air at the start, was three to four wide near the back of the field on the turn and lugging in down the stretch,
 acting very green. I'VE PAID MY DUES was off the pace and along the rail throughout, never in contention. HENRYTHEEIGHTH chased along the inside
 and was hustled by the rider to stay in range at the top of the stretch, but couldn't keep up down the lane. BYEBYE BYEBYE trailed the field throughout,
 never mounting a bid.

 ARTIE'S FIRST KISS had the speed to lead, set the pace, drew away upper stretch and held under a drive. TARA DAWN showed brief speed, stalked the
 pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive and was gaining late. STERLING SPEED bumped by LOST CORSAGE and then
 with ELEANOR POWELL, settled in range, closed along the rail late turn, chased, but evened out in deep stretch. SILENT CAUSEWAY raced in mid pack,
 rode the rail on the turn then chased through the stretch. THE PINK PEGASUS, off slowly, settled in mid pack, dropped back early turn but came on again
 approaching the stretch then closed with some interest late. ELEANOR POWELL, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide through
 the turn then rallied gamely outside. ANITA GRIGIO raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but her rally
 stalled with a 16th to run. LOST CORSAGE broke outward and bumped STERLING SPEED, pressed the pace, dropped back on the turn and lacked a rally.
 CANADIAN ESSENCE got away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn but failed to menace. ENHANCED FINANCE,
 in range, chased four then three-wide on the turn but evened out in the final furlong. HARPSWELL showed brief speed then stalked the pace, made a move
 early turn but dropped back approaching the stretch and lacked a closing response.

 Footnotes
 COMPENSATE stalked the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn, bid at the 1/4 pole, led at the top of the stretch and widened to finish under a hand
 ride. LEA RO stalked the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and finished determinedly. MAGIC FLUTE broke outward
 and was steadied, settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. PIPESTONE raced in mid
 pack, closed three to five-wide on the turn then gained steadily through the stretch. CARA CATERINA settled off the pace, closed four to six-wide on the
 turn, rallied outside and closed a gap. SPIDER BELLE settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and
 rallied but did not menace. MALIBU DIAMOND showed brief speed then forced the pace, was hustled four to six0-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch
 but evened out in the final furlong. HASN'T HIT ME YET raced in striking range, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn but offered no closing
 response. OHEAVENS raced in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but was never in contention. SHES THE
 NORTH forced the pace, bid at the 1/4 pole, was no match for the winner at the top of the stretch and flattened out. DEARFUTUREHUSBAND led onto the
 main track, set a pressured pace, was headed at the top of the stretch and faded. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail
 through the turn but lacked a closing response.

 Footnotes
 DOTTED LINE chased the two leaders along the inside, got through a very tight spot on the rail as the frontrunners drifted out as they turned for home,
 stuck his head in front before the eighth pole and would not relinquish the lead in the final stages. ARTIE'S PRINCESS stalked the early leader without
 being asked, bid for the lead late on the turn when drifting out with the besieged frontrunner, had a brief lead in upper stretch but was immediately engaged
 to her inside by the winner, battling on gamely but second best. TORPEDO MAX was three wide in mid pack, came five wide late on the turn into range, fell
 back as they turned for home but gathered himself up and re-rallied stoutly to nail the show spot in the final few yards. CRAFTY CONQUEST broke out at
 the start and fell off the pace along the inside, followed the winner on the turn along the fence, angled out to look dangerous as they turned for home but
 could not match the energy of the top pair, and lost the show spot late. FORESTER'S TURN brushed the side of the gate at the start, tracked the leaders
 outside the eventual winner, drifted out to four wide late on the turn, ducked in and jumped onto his wrong lead in upper stretch, straightening out late and
 showing some interest in the final seventy yards. PRICELESS WILL was three wide throughout, roused by the rider late on the turn and did close mildly
 inside the final furlong. ROCKCREST led early, was pressed by the eventual place horse on the turn, drifted off the rail letting the winner inside him as they
 turned for home, fading down the stretch. AGNELLI was two wide and off the pace, roused along the rail on the turn but did not respond. CRYPTIC GRIP
 hesitated slightly at the start and fell back to four wide off the pace, never entering the picture.

 OCEANS OF LOVE showed speed with BOBBI'S LEGACY, led into the first turn, set a pressured pace, shook clear late backstretch, was reserved on the
 lead through the turn then held sway under very light coaxing. MOONLIGHT RAIN, in range, chased angling from the rail to three-wide late turn and finished
 under a determined drive. RIDEFORTHECAUSE, rated in mid pack, was hustled angling two to four-wide on the final turn, chased into the stretch and
 finished all out from the outside. BEAR PAW stalked the pace, chased four-wide on the far turn, finished gamely but evened out late. STOP WHO'S THAT
 settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but offered no closing response. ALICE'S WAR settled off the pace, closed three to
 five-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. LINE OF VISION broke slowly and settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the final turn but
 had no response in the stretch. BOBBI'S LEGACY tried for the early lead but settled in to force the pace, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a further
 response.

 Footnotes
 KEEP GOING was under strong restraint behind the leader on the first turn, settled and stalked on the backstretch, closed late turn and took command,
 dashed clear then held sway under a confident ride. DENMARK settled off the pace, closed to mid pack and hustled two and three-wide on the final turn
 then finished under a determined drive. JUST KITTEN YOU, rated off the early pace, closed four-wide on the far turn, ran into traffic late turn and rallied
 when he got clear. JUST FOR ROSE broke outward then settled in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then rallied gamely.
 COUNTRYSIDE DRIVE broke inward and bumped ROMAN NOMEN, settled in striking range, chased hard four-wide on the far turn and finished all out.
 SECRET ROI stalked the pace, dropped back on the far turn, was hustled three and four-wide but failed to menace. WHITE SAGE, rated off the pace, was
 hustled four and five-wide on the turn then finished gamely to no avail. CHARLES STREET settled off the pace, was hustled four to six-wide on the far turn
 but never reached contention. BRIDLECREST broke inward and bumped WATCH THIS then was rated off the pace, closed to mid pack on the far turn but
 lacked a rally. ROMAN NOMEN, bumped at the start, closed along the rail on the backstretch, was in range on the far turn but had no response in the
 stretch. FORTHEBOYS led early, set the pace, was headed late on the final turn and faded through the stretch. EVERGLOW stalked the pace, was hustled
 two and three-wide on the far turn but tired at the top of the stretch. WATCH THIS, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, dropped back on the far turn
 and lacked a rally. LORD PIETRO, pinched back at the outset, raced in striking range, dropped back on the far turn and also lacked a rally.
