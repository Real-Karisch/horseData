 Footnotes
 PRAYER BOY broke sharp from between foes, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch, gained a clear advantage at the eighth pole and held
 sway. CACHITO chased the early pace from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained forward but was no match late while just lasting for the place.
 CANYON FIRE stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded entering the drive, altered outside but just missed
 the place. EL MOZO was forced five wide into the first turn, chased the pace from the outside, held a forward position for the drive but came up empty.
 SPEEDY HUNTUR could only improve position. CAT'S SHINING STAR could only pass tired ones. HALOS PRAYER forced six wide into the first turn, was
 no factor and faded late. OUTRUN vied from the inside early and tired. HITTER drifted out into the first turn, carried out rivals, chased the pace from the
 outside and faded. RUN AWAY RALPH was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 ONE SPECIAL ONE up close early from the inside, chased the pace through the turn, responded along the rail entering the drive and was just up the final
 jump. SPANISH EXCHANGE chased the early pace from the inside, dropped back entering the turn, responded when sat down for the drive and closed with
 a rush. LITTLE T chased the early pace from the outside, advanced through the turn, responded but was outfinished for the place. SELENAS JEWEL forced
 the early pace outside but had nothing left. SUDDEN AFLEET could only improve position. TENACIOUS FAITH dueled from the outside early, gained a
 clear margin through the turn then faded in the drive. FICKLE FLASH was no factor. BLESSED VILLANA forced the early pace and tired. BELINDA chased
 the early pace and faded. CUTENESS APRIORITY showed little.
