 Footnotes
 STAR HUNTER stalked along the inside while just off the leaders' heels, tipped to the three path at the five sixteenths pole to make a bid for the lead while
 between horses at the quarter pole, reached the lead in hand into the lane, then kicked away in upper stretch and widened under driving pressure.
 DISSENSION had a tardy start and was driven to gain position, raced in midpack from the three path down the backside before coming under more
 pressure into the turn, finally responded and quickened in upper stretch, split rivals in the three path at the furlong marker, but was second best.
 ROBOTRON vied in the three path after the start while between horses, took back and stalked the leading duelers after a furlong, rebid in the four path
 approaching the quarter pole as STAR HUNTER maneuvered out and GLISTENING STAR made an outside bid, proved no match for STAR HUNTER in
 upper stretch, then kept on, but was outfinished for place. BEL CANTO dueled in the four path outside of rivals, angled to the two path into the turn as she
 and SWEET HALL took over, forged a lead from that rival at the five sixteenths pole and put that foe in tight quarters when she received bids from other
 rivals at the quarter pole, but was bested in upper stretdch and. ONE THIRTY ONE raced far off the pace in the two to three path, then finished evenly while
 passing tired rivals and never threatening the leaders. SWEET HALL dueled in the two path, then angled to the rail into the turn, was put to a drive to keep
 pace at the five-sixteenths pole, but weakened and backed out in tight quarters at the quarter pole, the subsequently weakened. GLISTENING STAR raced
 in midpack in the four path down the backstretch, made a stout five wide rally around the turn and bid for the lead in the six path at the quarter pole, but
 weakened while hanging on her left lead into the lane, then stopped. LOVE TOTEM trailed throghout, took the turn in the five to seven path, and was never
 involved.

 OLYMPIC SMOKE set the pace along the rail while rating in hand, drew off easily away from the field around the turn, then widened her lead under driving
 pressure in upper stretch before being geared down approaching the wire. BUDGET CUT rated far off the pace in the three path between horses, shuffled
 back without checking to get out from between rivals into the turn, stuck to the three path around the turn, then maneuvered through traffic in upper stretch,
 split rivals at the furlong marker, and surged late to get up for place approaching the wire. FUN AND GAMES chased the pace setter from the thee path,
 was coaxed along at the five sixteenth pole as the leader was getting away, proved no match for that foe in upper stretch while holding place, then stayed
 on, but was bested for place approaching the wire. CORA ANNE stalked along the inside, but was outpaced around the turn then tired in upper stretch.
 PROM THEME settled in midpack after a quick start, came into the turn in the to path, left it in the four path, but stayed on her left lead and failed to make
 headway while being outfinished for minor rewards. MISS FRANK E trailed while saving ground around the turn, but failed to sustain a bid in upper stretch,
 and weakened. SOHNI chased the pace from the three to four path, came into the lane in the six path, and subsequently weakened.

 Footnotes
 PRODUCER battled hard in a two way duel to the stretch, encountered another to make it a three way duel through the stretch run, dug in gamely and
 repelled bids to hold on in a game effort. BECAUSE IT'S TIME perfect position to the turn, came with a three wide run, split horses in late stretch with dead
 aim on the duelers but just missed in a gallant try. CHOIR DIRECTOR tracking position three wide, joined the fray with a short lead at the furlong pole but
 was outfinished in the final sixteenth. WALKING STICK good inside speed to deep stretch, stayed on well in the drive. BEAUKATI raced evenly from inside
 throughout with no late kick when needed. TIME IS MONEY broke slow and never reached contention throughout. QUIET DUDE never a menace. KINETIC
 ART outside run while never a threat. SUPREME VENTURE was through early and dropped back.

 Footnotes
 JOYFUL FROLIC settled far off the pace in the two path, rallied outside of horses in the five path around the far turn, then tipped to the seven path in
 midstretch, quickened under mild pressure, and got up approaching the wire. NOVELLA vied along the inside early on, took back to stalk from the pocket in
 the first turn, held that spot around the far turn, tipped to the three path at the quarter pole, then to the five path in upper stretch, rallied and made a bid
 outside of the leaders, but was simultaneously hounded by JOYFUL FROLIC, who then bested her in the late stages. MCKENZIE HONEY prompted the
 pace setter from the two path, made a bid downthe backstretch and dueled for the lead around the far turn, then forged an advantage in the three path into
 the lane, led to the furlong marker, but gave way in the late stages. HEAVEN ESCAPE angled to the rail into the first turn while in midpack, advanced inside
 of horses into the far turn and gained on the leaders through it, then attempted a rail bid in upper stretch, but failed to kick on and got outfinished. GRAMS
 FUTURE was squeezed between rivals at the start, trailed through the first turn, swung to the seven path into the lane, and offered a belated rally without
 threatening the leaders. VORTICES set a collapsing pace along the inside through quick fractions, dueled for the lead around the far turn, but gave way into
 the lane when shifting to the two path, and faded between horses in the late stages. LOVE IS ALIVE stalked from between horses in the two path, was
 scrubbed on into the far turn, but failed to respond through the bend and lacked a rally in the stretch. EDGE OF PLEASURE saved ground from midpack,
 then maneuvered between horses down the backstretch, but failed to menace thereafter. SAGARA raced in midpack from the two to three path and never
 was a factor. SPINNING TOP was never involved while racing in the three to four path throughout. THERIGHTTOBEARARMS stalked the pace from the
 three path while just off the leaders, bobbled over bad ground around the first turn, but kept position, then faltered into the far turn and stopped in the
 stretch.

 SAY IT AIN'T SO press pace from inside, set down for the drive and grinded away to inch clear to the wire. INSURGENT dueled early, edged off at the
 quarter pole, dug in gamely but nailed in the final stages. JENNYSREGALMAN made a five run to the turn, stayed outside with a belated run in the final
 sixteenth. FINISHED inside position to turn, shuffled back a bit past the five sixteenth pole, stayed on well late. BOURNE IN NIXA broke slow rushed four
 wide to turn, caught in tight in late stretch, angled in late with no gain when clear. STATELY OAK close up to turn, could not muster a run and faded in the
 stretch. RUNAWAY BABY never menaced close to inside throughout. SPRING SOLO always back.

 Footnotes
 BOOTS N' BATTLE rated in midpack while in the two path and between horses into the turn, gained inside of rivals to track from just off the pace setters into
 the lane, split horses in upper stretch, surged to the lead with a stout rally, and drew off. PLATINUM GALE stalked in the two path, was driven to gain and
 hold other rivals off into the turn, held her positioning into the lane, but was bumped by BOOTS N' BATTLE as the foe maneuvered off the inside and got
 jostled between rivals in upper stretch, proved no match for the aforementioned foe, but re-rallied inside of ELLIE'S STROLL to re-achieve place in the late
 stages. ELLIE'S STROLL stalked from midpack in the three path, was driven around the far turn and rallied to make a bid in the four path at the quarter
 pole, but was bested by an inner rival in upper stretch, and got outfinished by another for place in the late stages. RUN LIKE REV bumped an inner rival at
 the start, raced in midpack in the four path, commenced a slight rally at the seven sixteenths pole, but drifted to the six path at the quarter pole, flattened
 out, and finished evenly. PRETTY PENNY broke out and bumped a foe at the start, raced far off the pace in the five path around the turn, then failed to
 threaten while staying on mildly through the lane. IN LOVE bobbled a bit at the start but recovered and rushed to a clear lead, held the lead tothe quarter
 pole, but was headed into the lane and gave way in upper stretch before further weakening at the furlong pole. ARLANZA had a stow start and trailed
 around the turn before shifting to the five path into the lane, then stayed on mildly. AMELIA'S BACK failed to menace. TALE OF TIARA saved ground from
 midpack, but weakened into the turn and failed to mount a rally. FLATTER ME ALLIE was squeezed at the start, stalked in the three path, but faltered
 between rivals at the five sixteenths pole then faded without perseverance at the quarter pole and subsequently stopped. AGLAIA was through early.
