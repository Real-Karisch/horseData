 clear margin at the eighth pole and steadily inched clear while kept to task. HEZA BLING THING well placed early from the inside, chased the pace up the
 backstretch, inched closer entering the second turn, responded along the rail entering the drive and was just up for the place. CONNER CLARK stalked the
 early pace from the inside, advanced entering the second turn, altered outside for the drive, responded but faltered late. HITTER outrun early, steadily
 advanced up the backstretch, advanced inside through the second turn, responded entering the drive but could not sustain the effort. KING FORMEREDITH

 Footnotes
 CHOCOLATEICECREAM stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, responded entering the drive, gained a clear
 margin at the eighth pole then was all out to last. BAIRES BOY unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded
 when sat down for the drive and closed with a rush to just miss. TOO TALL TONY dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, remained forward
 for the drive but could not keep pace while just lasting for the show. DAVE HOEGHT pressed the early pace from the outside, made a bid entering the
 second turn but just missed the show. CANYUTEL could only improve position. MY BEST SHOT dueled from the outside and tired. MORETHANFISHIN had
 a steady fade. ACES FULL was always outrun.

 Footnotes
 PILOT HOUSE dueled from the outside early, gained a clear margin up the backstretch, battled through the second turn, remained engaged through the
 drive with DEVILISHLY CLEVER, drifted in deep stretch and outnodded his rival late. After a Jockey's Objection and review by the Stewards' there was no
 change. DEVILISHLY CLEVER dueled from the inside early, fought through the turn, remained engaged with the winner but was outnodded. TIZ A
 MELODY forced the early pace from the inside, remained forward for the drive, responded but was outfinished for the place. GOTTHERIGHTONEBABY
 well placed from the inside, remained forward entering the drive, responded along the rail, was steadied at the one sixteenths pole then went evenly. BACK
 STAGE BOY was no factor. CAMERON RULES was no threat. WHISKEY BRAVO chased the early pace and tired. MR. BANDINI'S BAND was never
 close.
