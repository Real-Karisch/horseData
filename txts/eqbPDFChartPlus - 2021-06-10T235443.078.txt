 Footnotes
 OUR LUNATIC pursued the loose pacesetter outside, led passing the eighth pole and quickly rallied clear. EVERY STEP dropped far behind then showed
 late energy outside. TEAM RIBOT chased wide throughout and finished nicely without threatening. GENEROUS SPIRIT sprinted clear along the inside then
 shortened stride in the stretch. CARDCOUNTER rushed up to contention into the far turn then flattened out. NAVY COMMANDER urged close up inside,
 was asked for run on the turn but faltered. OFFENDER saved ground and gradually weakened. PAT AND RON trailed throughout and lost contact with his
 field.

 Footnotes
 DREAMING OF NENO took the lead at once, set the pace in three path, held a huge lead mid stretch, began to shorten stride, was put to stretch right
 handed pressure and had more than enough to preserve the victory. GRIFF, off slowest, split rivals when rallying on the turn and through stretch and was
 getting to winner. DODDSPRIVATELABEL, wide and outrun to stretch, closed much too late while drifting out. EL GRANDE ROJO saved ground and failed
 to be a serious factor. DOUBLE THE CHEERS, bumped leaving the gate, chased from the four path before tiring. HE'S COTTON, jostled leaving the gate,
 drifted out on the turn and then tired. ROCKIN COWBOY came out leaving the gate bumping HE'S COTTON, ducked out past the middle of the track soon
 after, remained very wide and failed to menace. RUNAWAY MISTRESS, wide, failed to threaten. BAJAN SUMMER stumbled leaving the gate and then
 came in bumping DOUBLE THE, recovered to race two wide in second flight but then faltered through the stretch. MALIBU HIGH never seriously
 threatened.

 Footnotes
 DIAMOND KING stalked the pace three wide, took over into the stretch and edged off under moderate pressure. A DIFFERENT STYLE saved ground close
 up to the stretch, angled out and rallied strongly. HEARTFULLOFSTARS chased wide throughout and continued gamely to the finish. CEEVEE lacked
 speed, advanced outside and offered some late energy. CHARMING BOBBY hustled to a clear advantage inside to the stretch then faltered. MIND
 BOTTLING chased outside and began retreating on the turn. TOMATER GATOR prompted the pace in the two path and proved empty in the stretch.
 CURRENCY WAVE dropped back early and saved ground while no threat. DIG THAT MINE raced greenly down the backstretch dropping far behind.
 SPECTACULAR PLUM broke slowly and never reached contention. SEVEN GEMS lagged far behind and lost contact with his field.

 turn and then lacked a strong closing kick. LETTHEMOOSELOOSE, very wide early, angled to the rail after a quarter mile and was no real threat.
 FAIRYBROOK failed to menace. ROSIE P stumbled leaving the gate, dueled between foes then tired.

 Footnotes
 ITS ALL RELEVANT saved ground, bided his time waiting for racing room near stretch, angled to the outside entering the stretch, took the lead near
 sixteenth pole and was all out to hang on. FAST FRIAR, racing in the three path, took the lead near furlong grounds and battled tenaciously to the wire.
 THURMAN MERMAN set the pace along the rail and weakened late in a nice try. SONOMA CRUSH saved ground and lacked a rally. FLASHY KYEM
 steadied in tight in the opening furlong, raced between foes and then tired. TAIRNEACH, wide, made a run on the turn but then tired. TOP BRASS broke
 slowly and then raced very wide. BASHA, extremely wide, had only brief speed. GOING ABROAD drifted out on backstretch, raced between foes and
 stopped. ROLIN WITH OLIN stumbled leaving the gate, was hustled to race just off pace then stopped.

 FIRSTHAND REPORT controlled the pace inside, was challenged in the stretch and held on tenaciously to earn the narrow victory. BERN' JAMES BERN
 settled outside, advanced four wide on the final turn, loomed boldly but was outfinished. EDGE OF REALITY made a menacing wide bid into the far turn
 then flattened out in the stretch. UNCLE DAVE saved ground throughout, continued nicely but lacked a late kick. TASIT was blocked repeatedly down the
 backstretch and the final turn, angled out to secure room in the stretch but lacked a response. CHATEAU DE VIZILLE dropped back outside, made a brief
 bid on the final turn then went evenly in the stretch. LATE BREAKING NEWS fanned wide on the first turn, remained outside and gave way. TACTICAL
 PLAN prompted the pace outside then steadied retreating between rivals on the final turn.

 and missed. MATT KING COAL set the pace two wide, drifted out and bumped winner deep but then was bumped by that rival in deeper stretch and gave
 way grudgingly. DISCREET LOVER, just off the rail and just off pace under rating, moved between on the final turn, drifted out in early stretch and finished
 willingly. DONEGAL MOON, racing in the four path, split rivals on the final turn but then flattened out. SEA RAVEN was in motion in the gate prior to the
 start breaking slowly and then was squeezed back leaving the gate then never threatened. GRASSHOPPIN dueled for command along the rail then
 dropped back steadily. MR. JORDAN came out leaving the gate, was very wide racing into and rounding the first turn, remained wide in a forward position

 COAL FRONT urged to the front inside, was collared near the quarter pole, lost the lead briefly passing the eighth pole but gamely repelled the challenge
 and edged away to the finish. AMERICAN PASTIME broke slowest, advanced strongly four wide, earned a brief lead with less than a furlong to go but was
 outfinished. PETROV saved ground close up to the stretch, angled outand was clear for the show award while no threat to the top pair. AQUAMARINE
 prompted the winner outside to the quarter pole and weakened through the stretch. RUNNING MATE hustled close up between rivals and began faltering on
 the turn. ANN ARBOR EDDIE saved ground, awaited room in a bit tight to the turn then lacked a bid. ACTION EVERYDAY dropped back early and
 continued well while failing to menace. GLORY STARS chased wide and was never in contention. EXCITATIONS trailed down the backstretch then passed
 a fading rival. SONIC MULE was urged close up outside to the turn then stopped abruptly.

 Footnotes
 IT TIZ WELL broke sharply then was eased back slightly and allowed to race outside and just off the early pace under a snug hold, was asked for run and
 rallied around the leaders racing into stretch, took the lead under right handed rousing leaving the furlong grounds and edged away. ABEL TASMAN broke
 slowly and awkwardly, was angled to the inside on the first turn, had a clear lane on the rail and was hustled to challenge for the lead after a half mile, she
 stuck her head in front near the quarter pole, relinquished the lead near furlong marker and while no match for winner, gamely fought back to regain place.
 LOCKDOWN set the pace in the three path, hooked up with ABEL TASMAN after a half mile, regained the lead near furlong grounds, her rider dropped his
 whip nearing the sixteenth pole and she was out-finished for the place spot. MOPOTISM, racing in the four path while never far back, eased out wider racing
 into the stretch but lacked a strong closing kick. PROUD AND FEARLESS, in the three path and just off the pace, also eased out a bit entering the stretch
 but then failed to sustain her bid. ACTRESS saved ground while unhurried, swung out wide on the final turn, raced erratically through the stretch, drifting in
 and out and flattened out. SALTY, wide while outrun, drifted in through stretch and was no real threat. TERESA Z, well off the rail, never threatened. SINE
 WAVE, wide and just off the early pace, dropped back steadily. THIRSTFORTHECUP, wide and just off the pace, was finished after a half mile. STAY
 FOND trailed.

 Footnotes
 WEST COAST alternated for the lead outside in hand, took over when ready nearing the quarter pole then extended his lead while taken in hand late. IRAP
 settled wide off the pace, rallied five wide into the lane, lugged in sharply at the eighth pole and was subsequently vanned off. GIUSEPPE THE GREAT
 reserved far behind, closed strongly outside too late. GAME OVER stalked the pacesetters three wide, was pushed in slightly when tiring near the eighth
 pole. TALK LOGISTICS dropped back early then picked off rivals without threatening. OUTPLAY earned a narrow lead inside, dueled after a quarter mile
 and gradually weakened. TIMELINE saved ground close up for five furlongs then gave way. IRISH WAR CRY chased three wide early, bid on the final turn,
 steadied when the runner-up crossed over into his path then continued to falter. TERM OF ART trailed far behind then passed a fading opponent. WATCH
 ME WHIP saved ground off the pace and gave way readily. The stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run with no action taken.
