 Footnotes
 UNITED PATRIOT prompted the pace along the inside, forged command before going a half, opened clear on the turn and widened. OVER RIDER settled
 in hand, ranged up four wide to make a bold bid leaving the turn, but was unable to reach the winner. IN A FOG contested the pace three wide, weakened
 entering the stretch, but had enough left to preserve the minor award. DIRTY DIAMONDDEEDS contended along the inside, waited in traffic leaving the
 turn, altered out entering the stretch to find room, but came up empty in the drive. BYE CRAZY EYES lagged well back, circled into the stretch five wide but
 failed to make headway. DURANGO KID broke slow, moved up four wide, shied from the left handed whip and veered out near the five-sixteenths pole,
 stopped thereafter and was distanced through the stretch.

 Footnotes
 BIG EXCHANGE set the pressured pace along the inside, opened clear before going a half, remained unchallenged thereafter and drew away with ease to
 score in commanding fashion. TWO STEPPING GROOM was allowed to settle, came three wide to make his bid, angled out further and churned on to earn
 the place. PRIVATE TIME was allowed to settle, circled four wide and was along for the minor award. PRIVATE PARTY stalked the pace off of the inside,
 moved up three wide to make a mild bid, but faltered leaving the second turn and faded. THUNDERCLOUD was never a factor. CEEKY vied for the lead
 three wide for a half, stopped and was distanced through the stretch.

 TAP DADDY tracked three wide, took over entering the stretch, was kept to task and held sway. PONT DU GARD settled in hand, ranged up four wide,
 loomed a danger entering the stretch, but was unable to bridge the gap. SKY PROMISE was allowed to settle, advanced between horses, came four wide
 and continued on well to earn the show. TRUE LOYALTY broke a step slow, tucked in to save ground, moved up along the hedge to make a mild bid
 leaving the second turn, but failed to sustain the drive. MR ASHLEY was allowed to settle, circled into the stretch five wide and improved position. KING
 VALERO set the pace along the inside to the stretch and tired. NANOOSH was never a factor. REDYORNOTHEREICOME was through after a half.

 Footnotes
 LIMOUSINE LIBERAL tracked three wide, took over entering the stretch, was kept to task and edged clear. WARRIOR'S CLUB settled in hand three wide,
 moved with the winner leaving the turn, failed to seriously threaten that one but continued on well to clearly prove second best. STORM ADVISORY bobbled
 at the start, rushed up between horses to set the pressured pace, weakened during the drive but had enough left to stay on for the show. THE TRUTH OR
 ELSE was unhurried into stride, angled out leaving the turn but failed to make headway through the drive. LE KEN (ARG) contended toward the inside
 through the turn and tired.
