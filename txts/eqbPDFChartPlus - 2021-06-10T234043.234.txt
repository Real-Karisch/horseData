 JOYFUL NOISE up close early from the inside, dueled up the backstretch, battled through the second turn, remained engaged with GIA MAMA MIA entering
 the drive, put that one away at the eighth pole, was engaged by ROAD SHOW and outfinished that one after a stretch long drive. ROAD SHOW stalked the
 early pace from the outside, crept closer entering the second turn, responded to duel through the drive but was outfinished. DAME FORTUNE chased the
 early pace from the inside, advanced through the second turn, responded when asked but could only gain the show. GIA MAMA MIA broke sharp from the
 outside, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn but had nothing for the drive. ROYAL LUXE
 pressed the early pace outside but had no late response. CHIEF INCA was no factor. IGOTYURGRASSHOPPER was finished early. WELL SPUN had a
 steady faded in a dull effort.
