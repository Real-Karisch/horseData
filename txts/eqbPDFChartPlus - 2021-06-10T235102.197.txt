 Footnotes
 SWINGING STAR chased outside a rival then between horses on the backstretch and into the second turn, continued outside a foe leaving that turn, came
 out in the stretch and rallied under left handed urging to nail the runner-up late. DR. TROUTMAN quickly sped to the lead, opened up on the first turn, set
 the pace on a conspicuous advantage along the inside, continued clear in the stretch and held on well but was worn down nearing the wire. DARK ENERGY
 three deep early, stalked outside a rival then off the rail leaving the second turn and into the stretch and continued on willingly late to best the others. RUN
 LIKE RHETT broke a bit slowly, angled in and settled inside, went outside a rival into the second turn and four wide into the stretch and improved position in
 the drive. THIS TOWN saved ground chasing the pace, came out in upper stretch, was between foes in deep stretch and lacked the needed rally.
 TOPGALLANT angled in and chased inside, came out into the stretch, angled back in some in upper stretch and could not offer the necessary late
 response. BUILDER reluctant to load, hesitated to be away behind the field, settled outside a rival then three deep on the backstretch and second turn and
 into the stretch and did not rally. ACCREDITATION chased a bit off the rail then inside into and on the second turn and into the stretch and lacked a further
 response.

 Footnotes
 PACIFIC STRIKE chased outside a rival then between foes, went three deep nearing the quarter pole then outside a foe into the stretch, came out in upper
 stretch and rallied under left handed urging to get up three wide late. HIMMAH (IRE) stalked three deep then outside a rival to the stretch, came out some in
 the drive, bid between horses in deep stretch and continued gamely. SPIEL prompted the pace three deep then outside a rival on the second turn, took the
 lead in upper stretch, inched away in midstretch and held on well but was caught late. RESOLU saved ground chasing the pace, came out in upper stretch,
 went around rivals in midstretch then angled in and finished well while in tight off heels nearing the wire. CHIFFON broke a bit slow, angled in and settled
 outside a rival then inside into the second turn, came out leaving that turn and three deep into the stretch and found her best stride late. BELLA SIGNORA
 (IRE) saved ground off the pace, came out in the stretch and was outfinished. LOVING MOMENT angled in and stalked a bit off the rail on the first turn then
 inside, inched forward leaving the second turn and into the stretch, steadied sharply in tight along the fence in midstretch and could not recover. FASHION
 BRAND broke a bit slowly, angled in and settled off the pace inside, came out some in the drive and lacked the needed rally. INTO GLAMOUR had good
 early speed and set a pressured pace inside, came a bit off the rail in upper stretch, drifted in some in midstretch and weakened in the final furlong. AHA
 pressed the pace between horses, dropped back on the second turn and had little left for the stretch.
