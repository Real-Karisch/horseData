 path, was asked with three furlongs to run, vied inside of the winner in the two path on the far turn, lost the lead at the three-sixteenths, kept on well in the

 Footnotes
 STOLEN CANDY raced in the three path on the first turn, moved in entering the backstretch, settled off the pace, advanced closer with a half-mile to run,
 was urged along while inside for most of the far turn, shifted to the two path while gaining at the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch, dueled
 gamely with the runner-up and narrowly prevailed then returned bleeding from the mouth. CRAZY IVAN went clear early, raced in the two path early on the
 first turn then dropped to the rail, set the clear pace, controlled the action while inside on the far turn, was challenged coming to the three-sixteenths, dueled
 with the winner in the stretch and just missed while well clear for the place. CIVITAVECCHIO (ARG) went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the
 outside, raced four wide under urging on the far turn and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. RED ZENON moved from the inside to the
 two path on the first turn, tracked the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and weakened then lost the show. MAD RULER dropped back
 between horses early, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while five wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under
 the whip and failed to rally. ARCHIBOLDO saved ground at the rear of the field, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. OVERNIGHT STAY
 saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. SMART PIONEER was taken up
 off heels nearing the first turn, dropped to the rail on that bend, was reserved off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, moved out while behind
 horses in upper stretch and failed to threaten. FIFTY TWO THOUSAND went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back
 under urging in the three path on the far turn and came up empty. (Rail at 10 Feet)
