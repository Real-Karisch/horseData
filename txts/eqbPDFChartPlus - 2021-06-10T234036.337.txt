 Footnotes
 LIGHT THE VOW away without apparent mishap, departed the backstretch from the three path, ranged up as the half was being completed, swung out
 approximately six wide for the drive home, completed the maneuver and vied as the widest of four, then three to the sixteenth pole, got engaged in a duel
 with the runner up afterwards and mustering up good determination, got the job done. GIVETHEMAN A CIGAR off the inside throughout, stalked the front
 runners towards the two path and from between opponents on the turn, spun into the path five headhing home, put up a fight still in between rivals to the
 vicinity of the sixteenth pole, went at it one on one with the winner thereafter and although willing to the end, got denied. QUAI VOLTAIRE made light
 contact with I MISS MY FATHER right after the field had been released, cut over to the inside, sat forwardly placed, was let out loose for the drive home,
 flattened out late and had to settle for the show. I MISS MY FATHER brushed with QUAI VOLTAIRE at the start, went on to attain a narrow advantage,
 defended it positioned in the two path, came under much heavier pressure prior to stepping into the stretch, was asked for more at the head of the stretch,
 reliinquished to the winner before going another furlong, continued to argue inside a few others until about a sixteenth to go before weakening.
 SHIPSANDGOODS pursued the pace from the three path, was driven seven wide during the initial portion of the stretch, lacked the needed response.
 DEVILRY prompted the pacesetter from the three path, was slightly wider off the rail bidding into the lane, came up empty and backed away. TAMMANY
 GIANT was steadied twiice early, after going about in a keen manner, entered the turn from the two path and failed to make its presence felt.

 Footnotes
 FROSTIE ANNE a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, chased four to five wide down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, raced four wide through
 the turn advancing under her own power to take command at the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and was displaced from
 command, swung five wide into upper stretch, got shaken off nearing the eighth pole, dug in under a drive to come again rallying to get up in the final jumps
 and prevail. SPECIAL DIVIDEND four then three wide down the backstretch, chased three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
 tucked briefly to the two path at the five-sixteenths splitting foes to take command nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide at that station, inched away
 under a drive drifting in to the rail under an off sided stick, dug in under lone threat and was caught in the last jumps to the finish. PALLADIAN BRIDGE five
 wide down the backstretch, continued five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths while very briefly tucked four wide, swung five
 to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick for the show honors. CATS HALO six wide down the backstretch, chased four wide through the turn
 under encouragement from the three-eighths, cornered six wide for home, passed tired foes. SPLASH OF SASS just off the inside at the tail of the field,
 came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered no response. E WARFARE flashed brief speed showing the way
 from the two path, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded command nearing the five-sixteenths, backed away and went three wide into
 upper stretch, then folded in the drive.

 CHRISTMAS SKY away the quickest, was pulling on the left while proceeding along the chute, vied for command two to three for most of the trip to the
 quarter pole, arrived at the station in a practical dead heat with SEAM, had already forged itself to the advantage when siwtched over to stronger handling a
 sixteenth later, kicked clear, remaining under some urging to the end. FREE KITTY underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, swung five wide into the
 lane, proved no match while rallying for the place. SEAM argued for command from the inside route, got set down as the third fraction was being finalized,
 yielded for good a few strides later then steadily backed away. PAULA'S PISTOL had the pilot grab hold after shying in slightly at the start, took up the
 chase from the two path, between rivals for almost six furlongs, made it into the lane and gave way. SUNDAY GRAVY tracked the front runners while taking
 the inside for six furlongs, came up empty after being anglied to the outside at the top of the lane. FIRST DAWN in the two path for three-quarters, had no
 speed.

 LAND MINE away well, drafted behind the pacesetter in the two path, picked up interest angling to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, was given her cue
 challenging in earnest three wide stepping into upper stretch, blew by the ones to catch to begin the final furlong as the new leader, steadily added to the
 winning margin. COTTON CANDY CUTIE was rated along prompting the pacesetter from the three path, inched its way to the top as three-quarters was
 being completed, got overhauled herself in the furlong grounds, had enough left in the last eighth to preserve the place. FROST WISE was coaxed along
 showing the way from the two path, with the runner up in attendance out in path three, got asked for more but relinquished nonetheless approaching the end
 of the bend, remained a prominent factor to midlane before weakening. GOBI in the two path and under some encouragement on the turn, fanned out into
 path five from upper to midlane, made no headway. CONNIE A pulled during the initail stages, underwent a fhree wide pursuit on the turn, commenced the
 stretch slightly wider, had no rally. THREE EIGHTY EIGHT sluggish in the chute, took up the chase from the two path on the turn to no avail;.

 FEAR NO EVIL broke a half length the tardiest after scraping the right side of the starting gate, stepped onto the turn from the four path, ranged up to the
 front runners, settled into upper stretch and unleashed its challenge, was in charge by the start of the final furlong, dug in well in the final stages to preserve
 the decision. CHINA RIDER pursued the front runners from the three path on the turn, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, finished willingly
 for the place. HARKNESS got guided over into the two path in short order, sat reserved for the opening half, angled out to be six wide after spinning off the
 turn, lacked the needed late response. TOWN TART broke on top and retained the advantage, vied to maintain control from the two path, came under
 heavier pressure as the half was being reched, got collared soon after spinning into the lane, weakened in the final furlong. TIZ RAE ANNA saved ground
 and would be the lone member of the field to spend significant along the inside route, sat forwardly placed for the half, was put to a drive with a very usable
 rail corridor heading home, faltered.

 tipped out past the five-sixteenths, came under a drive swinging six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors while never
 threatening the winner. CONQUEST TIZFIRE prompted the pace of FIRST CHARMER five then four wide coming under coaxing between foes at the
 five-sixteenths, took over command and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was displaced at the three-sixteenths, weakened in
 the late stages while along for the show honors. BAREEQA bobbled at the start, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide

 Footnotes
 MIGHT BE contended for command matched up with KAT O MINE along the backstretch, racing towards the two path, shook free of that opponent
 approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, sailed along unopposed during the run around the bend, all the while extending the margin, arrived at the
 quarter pole with several others having already been set down, strolled into the path four settling into upper stretch, straightened away and drew off as much
 the best, handily. UNBRIDLEDADVENTURE chased the winner four wide on the turn, got pounced upon by INDYGITA as three-quarters was being,
 out-fought that foe down the lane to claim the place. INDYGITA travelled three wide on the turn, was let out prior to turning for home, raced as a team with
 UNBRIDLEDADVENTURE down the lane and went on to lose that contest for second. SAME KINDA CRAZY came in slightly losing its footing springing
 from the gate, sat reserved along the overland route on the turn and was never involved. JONQUIL at a considerable distance from off the rail, was put to a
 drive by the five-sixteenths marker, failed to make any impact. KAT O MINE towards the inside, vied with the winner for the opening half and faltered.
