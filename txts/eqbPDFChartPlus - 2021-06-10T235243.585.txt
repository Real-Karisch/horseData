 Footnotes
 LION IN WAIT away a half length the fastest, conceded the top to TANYA'S GEM shortly afterwards, was patiently ridden stalking that opponent from the
 two path, began to close the gap as three-quarters was being rattled off, settled in at the three-sixteenths marker and was given its cue, but this juncture
 narrowly in front and fully-engaged with MISS MUNNINGS, staved off the stiff challenge from the aforementioned rival then dug in well during the late
 stages to stay in the clear. ORBOLUTION loosely pocketed for nearly three-quarters, got called upon more for the drive home, was worked into path three
 during the ensuing furlong, narrowed in, ultimately winding in a tie with MISS MUNNINGS for place honors. MISS MUNNINGS saw the rider take hold after
 breaking to the outside, underwent a three wide pursuit for six furlongs, was set down coming up to the three-sixteenths marker, vied with vigour therefter,
 but couldn't claim the top. ROMANTIC MOMENT guided onto the inside route approaching the conclusion of the chute, stayed put until the end of the bend,
 fanned out into the four path from upper to midstretch, made no late headway. CRIMSON FROST stepped three wide onto the backstretch, tucked back into
 the path by the half mile pole, was put to a brisk hand ride a furlong later, swung into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TANYA'S GEM gained
 control shortly after the start, cut over to the inside, showed the way on an open lead, acting keenly during the initial stages, came under heavier pressure
 as the third fraction was being finalized, succumbed about a sixteenth down the road, then backed away steadily.

 Footnotes
 SNEAKY SURPRISE stumbled at the start, came under coaxing to establish the front and show the way just off the inside through the turn, spun just off the
 inside for home, drew clear under a drive to prevail. MICROMILLION coaxed from the gate, was briefly in tight between foes at the nine-sixteenths before
 chasing five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, proved no match for the top one while running on clear of
 the rest to be along second best. AMERICAN SONG got bumped between foes at the nine-sixteenths as a quartet jostled for position, chased just off the
 inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and improved position for the show honors. WOMEN NOT EASY five then four wide
 in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, spun three wide for home, tired. LIL MORNING STAR hit the near side stall at the start, jostled for position
 among a quartet at the nine-sixteenths trading some leans and bumps before tucking along the inside, came under a ride at the three-eighths, spun just off
 the inside for home and tired. REWARDED got bumped between foes at the nine-sixteenths as a foursome fought for position, chased three wide under
 coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide at the quarter pole and tired.

 Footnotes
 MILITIAMAN remained along the rail after the field had been sent off and running, abandoned it for path two nearing the conclusion of the backstretch, saw
 the pilot resort to brisk encouragement a few strides shy of the five-sixteentsh pole, got angled into the five path during the ensuing furlong, kicked into his
 best once straightened away, was one of three rolling by NO MANS LAND welll inside the sixteenth marker, dueled belatedly with the runner up and got the
 job done. TIDE OF THE SEA quickly spotted along the rail, slipped out midpoint on the backstretch, took up the chase two wide on the second turn, under a
 ride prior to reaching the quarter pole, was gradually maneuvered three wide between upper and mistretch, closed in, along with two others, sparred on near
 even terms with eventual winner late and fell short. CHANTRY FLATS broke approximately a length the fastest, was three wide entering the clubhouse
 bend, but cleared over into the two path before departing it, then inched his way over to the rail once onto the backstretch, was challenged by NO MANS
 LAND as three-quarters was being reached, saw that one take over and edge away during the first half of the stretch run, stayed on well to secure the show.
 BAD BOY sat reserved two wide after underging a few light bumps right after the start, was under urging swinging one path farther off the rail, chipped away
 at the defict in the lane. NO MANS LAND dove onto the inside route coming up to the end of the homestretch, got eased to the outside and into path three
 once off of it, improved position so as to work out a tuck two wide at the five-sixeentsh pole, struck the front end shortly afterwards, kicked away to its largest
 lead from the top of the lane until midstretch, saw the others closing in once beyond the eighth pole, getting swallowed up in the final seventy yards.
 PLAYFUL CAT vied for command from the inside during the opening phases, remained forwardly placed until the top of the second bend and faltered.
 TIBERIUS MERCURIUS bumped lightly several times in the shadow of the starting gate, travelled three wide on the first turn, continued from off the inside,
 beginning the run around the far turn four wide and ending it in path three, stepped into the stretch and gave way. PIONEER DANCER pinched after
 undergoing several light bumps from both sides in rapid succession right after the start, raced two wide and primararily from between rivals on the first turn,
 went about the subsequent one in path three, was ridden four wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response.

 Footnotes
 H MAN away without apparent mishap, sat forwardly placed four wide, moved up to contest the pace as the widest of a foursome as the half was being
 completed, spun into the lane and was turned loose, out-fought the three opponents to the inside to emerge at the eighth pole in charge, kicked clear. O
 SHEA CAN U SEE brushed in the shadow of the starting gate, went over to the inside, cut the corner with usable room along the rail corridor available,
 narrowed in to get up for the place. SICILIA MIKE strung out four wide on the turn, angled six wide into the stretch, finished with willingness down the center
 of the strip to secure the show. BINKSTER suffered light contact from rivals on each side right after the start, shook it off and went on to contest the pace
 from path two, was forced to go about it from between opponents beginning from the three-eighths pole, kept at it until just inside the eighth pole then
 weakened. SAN JUAN DIEGO brushed with BINKSTER after breaking slightly to the outside, grabbed the advantage, showed the way being pressed by
 previously-mentioned foe, saw two others add themselves to the pace scenario at the midway point of the turn, in paths three and four respectively, was set
 down spinning two wide into the lane, put up some fight for a little while longer before giving away. MANIFEST DESTINY secured a prominent position after
 being brushed from both sides at the start, stalked the pace three, inched up to contest the pace approaching the three-eighths pole, doing so as one of a
 quartet, kept at it until deep into the furlnog grounds and tired. REAL DAN two wide entering the turn, got sent seven wide exiting it, failed to make any
 impact. FIVE STAR BUNT took up the chase three wide after bobbling at the start, shifted out into path five after entering the stretch, had no offering.

 Footnotes
 KULIK BEAR pursued the front runners at or near the two path during the opening phases, got driven four wide into the stretch, kicked into his best and
 closed in readily, roared to the front in the final seventy yards and shook free. SAYYAAF disputed the pace from along the inside proceeding along the
 backstretch, was taken in hand giving REAL MONEY both the advantage and a spot along the rail itself in the general area of the half mile pole, paused in
 hand approaching the quarter pole, got set down spinning into the lane, drafted behind the leader over the course of the ensuing furlong getting
 maneuvered into path two, mustered up willingness, but had to settle for the place. REAL MONEY sparred for command with SAYYAAF from path two
 during the opening phases, inched away from that opponent and over to the rail at the top of the turn, got turned loose for the drive home, was reeled in
 leaving the sixteenth pole, weakened into the show slot. TAAMER was caught leaning inward as the field was sent off and running, cut over to the inside,
 got called upon for run by the half mile pole, spun approximately six wide into the stretch, rallied mildly. MIAMI MUMBLES travelled in path two on the turn,
 made no impact. POINT OF HUMOR away awkwardly after losing his footing springing from the starting, contended for command two wide on the turn,
 arrived into the stretch and faltered. NORTHERN HAZE three wide onto the turn, was fanned out seven wide leaving it, lacked the needed response.
 PICKLE RICK corrected after breaking a bit to the outside, took up the chase two wide, between rivals for a portion of the going on the turn, gave way.
 SOUL FIGHT went on to save ground to no avail after brushing into the starting gate.

 Footnotes
 MARCONI three then two wide through the opening bend, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the spurting leader down the backstretch, began to
 advance on that rival into the far turn, remained patiently handled given some rein to work with, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
 take over command near the eighth pole, then edged away to the finish shying out in the final jumps under an off sided stick. ROCKETRY four to five wide in
 pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to get up in the final jump for the place honors.
 TOUR DE FORCE lunged at the start getting away a beat slow, advanced to establish the front and spurted away on the lead just off the inside, widened
 away down the backstretch through sensible splits, had the field begin to advance into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to
 three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was collared a furlong out, kept on to the finish just getting nosed for the place honors while preserving the
 show. MONONGAHELA bobbled at the start, raced just off the inside through the first turn before chasing four then three wide, came under coaxing nearing
 the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole, dug in flattening out in the very late stages. TWISTED TOM
 stumbled at the break, recovered to chase three wide through the first turn before settling five then four wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing
 three furlongs from home, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response.

 Footnotes
 AMANDA LANE sat reserved two to three wide, swung four wide into the lane and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, rallied with good energy down
 the center of the course, struck the front with less than seventy yards to go and edged away. MERLINS MUSE underwent a ground-saving journey, got cued
 up for the drive home, mustered up good energy rallying for the place. SHE'S DREAMIN made it over to the rail in short order, was sighted pulling with force
 on the bit until the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, setlted a bit when let out a notch at the five-sixteenths marker, then responded even more so when set
 down for the drive home, tipped towards path two in midstretch, battled onward well enough to stay for the show. SADIE LADY took up the chase from path
 two, was asked to pick it up being switched over to a brisk hand ride at the five-sixteenths marker, held well late after fighing hard all the way down the
 stretch. LILA RUTH away forwardly placed, disputed the pace from near the inside, was let out after the half had been reeled off, came under assault after
 completing the trip through the furlong grounds, got overhauled inside the sixteenth pole. AILISH a forward factor towards the inside during the initial stages,
 slithered her way into the two midpoint on the turn, got ridden into the lane and gave way. MOM'S KISSES moved over to the rail at the top of the turn,
 shifted outward in the lane, eventually wandering seven wide, made no impact. TRADEABLE in mijdpack taking up the chase two wide, commenced the
 stretch slighlty wider, lacked the needed response. COUNTABLE pursued the front runners two to three wide on the turn, went into path five for the drive
 home, had no offering. TAPPANZEE four wide departing the backstretch, shifted a couple of paths closer to middle of the strip once into the stretch while
 backing away. JA'S MALIBU vied for command three wide early, was through after going a half, then was allowed to fade away in hand down the stretch.
