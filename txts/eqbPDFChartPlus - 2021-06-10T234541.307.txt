 Footnotes
 SABRINA'S MAGIC quick to the lead, widened each call, while tons the best today. LACEY MAE well off rail to the turn, chased winner home but no match
 and held the place spot to the wire. FLY AWAY FLO tried to keep from inside, could not go on while best of rest just missing the place spot. HYDRA'S
 HOPE had a brief chase but faded back from the turn. BRAD'S DESTINY never a factor at any point. STILLAWAVES was antsy in the gate and reared at
 the start with the rider just holding on and lost all chance. LITTLE MISS SHORTY never a menace.

 Footnotes
 TRAPPE VALLEY had a terrible start, rallied and bumped rival past the quarter pole and into the stretch with widea bid, sustained it and glided past the field
 as tons best. GRATEFUL CAUSE well placed while never far back, rallied three wide into the stretch but was outfinished to the wire in a game effort.
 TRIPLE DELIGHT had good speed to the turn, led into stretch from between horses but weakened in the final sixteenth. NOW ROAR unhurried to the turn,
 bumped by winner past the quarter pole while outside and gained in the late going. TIZWAYORTHEHIGHWAY speed to the lead alternated back and forth
 but faltered in the late stages. COMEDY ZONE skimmed rail throughout, caught in tight quarters stretch from three sixteenths pole to almost the sixteenth
 pole with no gain when clear. WALKING STICK took some bad steps after the start and bobbled but raced evenly while tiring late. GOOD MAN CHARLIE B
 never a contender.

 BOOTS guided to the front to set all the pace, well rationed throughout and stayed well clear as much the best today. DATE ARCH well placed from inside
 to the stretch, chased winner while no match while well clear of the rest. WINDY CAPE chased leader to the quarter pole before folding up and stopped
 while also best of the rest. TIZ MAKIN MISCHIEF raced evenly with no response while well clear of the rest in the stretch run. KITS GOLD close up to the
 half but could go no more and dropped far back. RAT TUFF never had a chance and dropped far back and galloped past the finish and walked off.
