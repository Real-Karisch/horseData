 Footnotes
 PEANUTBUTTER SHAKE contested the lead along the rail, drifted out nearing the furlong marker bumping with AUSTIN'S XCHANGER and under the whip
 outran the latter to the line. AUSTIN'S XCHANGER tracked along the two path, volleyed for the lead after that, was bumped by the winner nearing the
 furlong marker, checked briefly and finished willingly. SPANISH EMPIRE broke slow, unhurried four wide into the backstretch, three path into the lane and
 then found his best stride late. RUXPIN was well placed along the three path around the turns and weakened. THUNDERS FURY saved ground on the
 turns and then finished wide. A Stewards inquiry was posted concerning PEANUTBUTTER SHAKE drifting out and bumping with AUSTIN'S XCHANGER
 nearing the furlong marker. Also a claim of foul was lodged by the rider of AUSTIN'S XCHANGER against the winner for interference nearing the eighth
 pole, resulted in the disqualification of PEANUTBUTTER SHAKE and was placed 2nd.

 Footnotes
 FIVE FREEDOMS In hand along the rail, gained inside on the last turn, eased out in the lane, collared the leader a furlong out, battled that one to the late
 stages and under pressure proved best. READ THE TECHNIQUE Away the best, set the pace along the rail, was hooked a furlong out, battled inside and
 finished willingly. CHARITABLE Jostled at the start, was well placed along the three path, four wide into the lane and finished with interest. CAT SQUAD
 Tracked along the two path to the top of the lane and weakened. TIGER D Away last, four wide into the first turn, three path tracking up the backstretch to
 the lane and tired. PERFECT GRATITUDE Jostled at the start, two path on the turns, was not a factor. SPACE TO REPENT Saved ground to no avail.
