 urging. BOSTON BIND was urged along on the outside, went around the turn in the three path, loomed a threat outside of the winner into upper stretch but
 proved no match in the final furlong while weakening but was well clear for the place. CHAMBLISS was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, dropped
 well off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out while gaining into the final furlong and was along for the show. MAN CAMP was urged
 along in the front half of the field, went around the turn in the three path and came up empty. SAINT WILLIAM chased the pace on the outside then in the
 two path on the tired. SHANGHAI STORY broke out at the start, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch,
 dropped in outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to respond. PURE VALOR angled in early while off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came
 five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DREAM ON MISTER was coaxed along on the inside, raced near the inside on the turn and capitulated.

 neighboring stall when that one flipped, dropped well back, saved ground on the turn and was outrun.

 Footnotes
 IMPRESSIVE STUDENT raced inside on the first turn, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, moved clear with three furlongs to run, rounded the far
 turn in the two path, responded well when down in upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. HARBOR PILOT went three wide on the first turn, settled
 towards the back, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for
 the winner. ZENUCCI was moving around at the start and last away, settled on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, moved to the two path near the
 quarter-pole and just missed the place while able to get the show. PADDY O'LIONEL moved out nearing the first turn, went four wide on that bend, settled
 well back in the field, went three then four wide on the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, swung seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
 response. TRUE EMPEROR went four wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, chased four wide on the far turn and tired. SEAN was taken
 in hand early, settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn and came up empty. IN CHARGE HALO bumped with a rival at the start, rounded the
 first turn in the three path, contested the pace on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn and tired. KING
 CAKE went around the first turn in the two path, was urged along on the backstretch, traveled around the far turn in the two path and was no factor. BAM
 BAM BRYAN bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, raced towards the front, came up empty in the three path on the far turn and
 retreated. LASS CHANNEL bumped with a rival at the start, raced in the two path on the turns and was outrun.

 Footnotes
 TURNER TIME was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, advanced late on that bend, made a bid at the quarter-pole, dueled with the
 runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong handling. MINI CHUNK chased the pace, raced in the three path on the turn, advanced to
 make a bid at the quarter-pole, dueled with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the place. BOURNE IN NIXA brushed
 with a rival at the start, raced towards the rear of the field, went four wide on the turn, advanced five wide into the stretch but came up empty while able to
 get the show. SPARKYS SURPRISE broke out at the start, settled on the outside, dropped from the three path to the two path on the turn, came three wide
 into the stretch and lacked the needed response. QUIET DUDE was urged along at the rear, raced in the two path early on the turn then shifted to the four
 path, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. GARRISON K was away alertly, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came through a
 clear rail opening to make a bid at the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. BEAUTIFUL GAME brushed with a rival at the start, settled
 under some urging, raced inside on the turn and failed to respond. VAPOR VIPER sped clear and set the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked
 outside the quarter-pole then swallowed up into upper stretch and stopped.
