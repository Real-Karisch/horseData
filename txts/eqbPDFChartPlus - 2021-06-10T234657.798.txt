 START THE SHOW quickly went to the front and showed the way racing in the two path then turned back the challenge of SHE'LL DO in the final furlong
 SHE'LL DO moved up in the three path on the turn, loomed boldly in the stretch then was denied. PEACE CORPS broke a step slowly, quickly reached
 contention then faded in the drive. FLATTER ME OWEN bobbled at the start then failed to be a threat. REDNECK LADY bobbled at the start, prompted the
 early pace then tired.

 stretch to gain the show. EXPECT DRAMA broke sharp to show the way to upper stretch and weakened. CAN'T PASS IT UP lacked a rally.

 Footnotes
 O'MALLEY was eased back along the inside early, then moved to the lead with a bid in the two path lead leaving the far turn and was under steady handling
 to hold MY SWEET PAYNTER safe. MY SWEET PAYNTER was well placed close to the pace and responded well to finish second best. SWEEPING IN,
 never far back, finished well to gain the show. SUMMER VOW got out into the first turn then finished well. LIGHTS DOWN LOW was unruly prior to the start
 then was forwardly placed and lacked the needed rally. SEVILLE'S PRINCESS failed to threaten. SLIDE A BIT showed the way to the far turn then
 weakened in the drive. LITTLERNR broke out and hit the gate then was no factor. CHAMPAGNE HORIZON was pushed out into the first turn then was
 pulled up in apparent distress after straightening into the backstretch and was vanned off.

 Footnotes
 CAT MOR BRIDGE was pinched back at the start, circled the field on the far turn and closed to win going away. PEYTON PLACE disputed the pace racing
 in the three path and faded in the final furlong. MAGGIE I'LL FIND U saved ground disputing the pace then faded in the final furlong. DIAMOND JUNIOR
 was pinched off in the run to the first turn. COSA DOLCE got out at the start then failed to menace with a mild bid. HIGH FREQUENCY disputed the pace in
 the two path then weakened in the drive. ROSEBUD'S HIGH lacked a rally. RAZZY'S REWARD tired. EL MAYITO got out in the run to the first turn then
 was checked. A claim of foul by the rider of EL MAYITO against MAGGIE I'LL FIND YOU for interference in the run to the first turn was not allowed following
 a stewards inquiry.

 UNION RANKS moved up outside the second flight on the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and was ridden out to prove much the best.
 CANNAVARO broke alertly to be forwardly placed then was no match for the winner. PURRS AGAIN quickly went to the front to set the pace then
 weakened in the drive. HOWBOUTDEMPATS failed to be a serious threat. ZAPPER rallied mildly. CZECH RATE showed little. IGOTSUNSHINE failed to
 threaten. EL TAUR attended the early pace then tired. THE CONSTABLE tired from his early effort. TRADE THE PICK showed little. CLASSY NEKIA was
 no factor. THE QUARTER, HALF, AND FINAL TIMES WERE TIMED AUTOMATICALLY AND THE SIX FURLONG AND MILE TIMES WERE PROVIDED

 DREAMING OF FRANK persevered waiting along the inside rail on the far turn then rallied between horses in the drive to get up in the final furlong. CARVE
 prompted the pace in the two path and lacked the needed closing kick. UNUSUAL FLEET saved ground setting the pace under good handling but was not
 good enough. FANTASIZE, never far back, responded well in the drive to close the gap. MONKEY'S MEDAL failed to be a serious threat. STADIUM lacked
 a rally. TEFLON TONY prompted the early pace then weakened.

 Footnotes
 HOWBOUTTHEMCOWBOYS rallied in the three path entering the stretch to gain the lead in the furlong grounds and drew clear under steady urging.
 STRONGBAKSTEELTOES moved up four wide into the stretch then lacked the needed closing bid. HEAVEN'S RUNWAY vied for the lead from the outset
 and weakened in the final furlong. TEQUESTA STORM disputed the pace racing two abreast then weakened. GAELIC MAN saved ground to little avail.
 JUST IRISH broke in a tangle then trailed.
