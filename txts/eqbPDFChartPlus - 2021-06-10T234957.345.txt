 Footnotes
 LEGENDARY NIGHT went right to the front, set the pace to the second turn, turned back BEAUSUN into the stretch then pushed clear and won driving.
 MAGIC BRO was settled to the half, bid two then three wide on the second turn, could not impact the winner but finished steadily for second. BEAUSUN
 pressed the winner to the second turn, moved up to challenge at the five sixteenths, was outkicked into the stretch, drifted inward at the furlong marker,
 crowded BALLYCASTLE and forced that one to steady then finished evenly. BALLYCASTLE stumbled at the start, trailed to the second turn, saved ground
 to the stretch then was crowded inside by BEAUSUN, had to steady leaving the furlong grounds and finished evenly. ONBEHALFOF AUTISM chased the
 pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch but tired and stopped in the drive. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving
 BEAUSUN and BALLYCASTLE and disqualified BEAUSUN from third to fourth place for interference. It was a unanimous decision.

 Footnotes
 READY SAY GO hesitated briefly and broke half a step slow, settled to the half mile pole, bid three then four wide on the second turn then continued to
 respond in the drive, took over in mid stretch and held driving. JIMMY G stalked the pace to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch, was outkicked
 by the winner to mid stretch then dug in late to hold the place. MINISTER'S GLORY settled mid pack to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the
 stretch, shifted out for room in upper stretch then got the show without threatening the winner. IRISH SWING had no speed, trailed on the second turn while
 three wide then picked off rivals in the drive. HAILEY'S KID COMET tracked the pace to the second turn then saved ground but weakened in the stretch. I'M
 AMORE had no speed and was never a threat. FENTAGON pressed the pace for six furlongs then tired. ATONARUN set the pace from the rail to the
 stretch then also tired.

 the line. DAFNE WILDCAT also was stalking to the turn but was fanned four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but finished willingly for the
 place. ROSIE'S GOLD broke alertly, set the pace while racing off the rail to the stretch, could not stall the winner and weakened to lose the place.
 RUNNINFROMTHELAW trailed to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. SECRET PARANOIA was outsprinted
 to the turn while three deep, eased down to the two path into the stretch but lacked a closing response. FAIRLY LUCKY chased the pace three wide to the
 stretch then tired.
