 Footnotes
 VINTASTIC sprinted clear soon after the start, raced four-wide while setting the pace and held PEPPER SHARP at bay through the drive. PEPPER SHARP
 raced closest to the winner throughout while moved five-wide through the turn and failed to gain on that rival. ROMEOINBLUEJEANS settled off the leaders
 early, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and lacked the needed late response. CRUISIN ON was bumped at the break, showed
 no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SURVIVINGTHESTORM was bumped at the start then forwardly placed, raced
 four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. KALAMAITY GEM lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
 SCREAMIN DEMON raced off the pacesetters throughout and weakened in the drive. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

 Footnotes
 FAY BELLE was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out further approaching the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong
 to run and drew off as a handy winner. ROCKPORT BIRDIE stalked the pace of TEE TIME MARY while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing
 the quarter, gained a brief lead, was no match for the winner and was unsaddled on the back-stretch and vanned off. INFORMANT was off slow, raced
 unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady bid. STATELY COMMAND settled off
 the leaders early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly in the drive. TEE TIME MARY sprinted
 clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and weakened after going a half. JILAS LIL SWING showed no early speed, raced six-wide through
 the turn and was not a factor.

 MEANEE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane, wore down DAKOTA'S TANGO
 in the closing yards and was going away late. DAKOTA'S TANGO set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear lead nearing the three-sixteenths
 pole, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner late. MIDNIGHT WEAVE bobbled at the start, recovered quickly to chase the
 pace of DAKOTA'S TANGO while racing four-wide and failed to gain in the drive. STARACROSSTHEWATER was forwardly placed early, raced three-wide
 through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished evenly late. APHRODITIES KISS broke sharply to press the pace of DAKOTA'S
 TANGO from the inside and gave way after going a half. SAPHIREANFADEDJENZ bobbled at the start, lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn,
 angled out further nearing the quarter and did not offer a bid. LITTLE BITTY CHER was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
 factor.

 Footnotes
 WOODY'S FOLLY raced unhurried early, advanced six-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter, responded when set down for the drive
 and was up in the closing yards. CRIMSON WARLOCK settled off the leaders early, raced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore in tandem with
 GABE'S PRIDE nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival but could not resist the winner from over the top. GABE'S PRIDE stalked the leaders
 while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid into the lane, vied with CRIMSON WARLOCK and gave way in the drive. UPTOWNFREDDYBROWN was
 void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and finished with some late run. MACHO MARINI settled off the
 leaders early, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. I'LBEAMONKEYSUNCLE was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing
 four-wide and weakened after going a half. I B TANNER was off a step slow, lagged far back early, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor.
 ALWAYS OUTNUMBERD broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

 Footnotes
 PARKERS ROSE broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths marker, opened a clear
 lead with a furlong to run and was ridden out to be kept to task. CHAMPELINA settled off the leaders early, raced six-wide through the turn, offered a bid in
 tandem with the winner into the stretch, was no match for that foe in the drive but was clearly second best. FOOLSTONE was void of early speed, raced
 four-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the quarter and finished with some late run. MARIANA GRACE was away in good order to set a pressured
 pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way through the final furlong. SHE'SMUSICTOMYEARS
 lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter, was checked, angled in and did not menace. ASTOUNDING ABBY
 showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MEAN LIKE MY MOMMA was void of early speed, raced six-wide through
 the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not offer a bid. PEACEFUL PRESENCE pressed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened.

 Footnotes
 BEEFCAKE was bumped at the start then reserved just off the leaders early, raced six-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths
 pole, quickly opened a clear lead and was ridden out to the wire. FEAR OF THE CAT lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing
 the quarter and again in mid-stretch and finished willingly. KENDINI raced unhurried early, advanced seven-wide through the turn and finished with some
 late run. YOSSI was away in good order to set a pressured pace, raced three-wide through the turn, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter and gave way
 through the final furlong. GAMBLING STREAK was bumped at the start, pressed the pace of YOSSI while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.
 BOBBYGENESJUSTICE chased the leaders from the inside for a half and weakened.

 Footnotes
 EL ALTO HOMBRE was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead nearing the three-eighths marker and
 drew off through the lane with complete authority. COWBOY SWAGGER broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, could not
 match strides with that rival in the drive but was clearly second best. JUST MISUNDERSTOOD was bumped at the start, lacked early speed, raced off the
 rail through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was up for the show. C ME ROAR was forwardly placed early, raced five-wide through the turn and
 lacked the needed late response. BOSTON'S WAR WHOOP settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. TIME TO
 FIRE was void of early speed, raced eighth-wide through the turn and did not menace. HE'S GATSBY showed no early speed, angled out approaching the
 stretch and did not offer a bid. ROYAL KNIGHT was off a step slow, rushed to contend from the inside and weakened after going a half. TO GO CUP was
 bumped at the break, raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. TROJAN THE WILDCAT raced off the leaders early,
 moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.
