 Footnotes
 RIPPIN RANGER reserved behind the leaders, made a good move three wide late on the turn, caught the leader with a furlong to go and drew off late under
 steady urging. CONQUEST HIOSILVER closest to the pace, challenged the leader on the turn, held on well into the stretch, could not cope with the winner
 late but held on to be second best. SMART QUESTION forwardly placed along the inside, angled out once in the stretch but lacked a late bid. MIDNIGHT'S
 FANTASY unprepared at the start, was outrun for a half and could not menace. NORTHERN RANGER set the pace along the inside, held on well to the
 final furlong and tired. BARRY'S SWING was no factor. DUE TO HIS CHARM was outrun.

 way in the stretch. TEMEMON lost his footing at the start, was bumped after recovering, trailed to the stretch and could not menace. MAKE NOISE set the

 on even terms with that one to the final sixteenth and held on to be clearly second best. TRUE LOYALTY behind the top pair while off the inside, was no

 LADY SOUL alternated for the lead off the inside, repulsed a bid by the runner up in midstsretch and drew clear under steady urging. TO BE FAMOUS
 steadied when bottled up on the first turn, made a good three wide move on the second turn, reached a challenging position in midstretch but weakened
 late. NA PALI SPIRIT sluggish at the start, recovered quickly to race within striking distance, was five wide midway through the second turn when rallying
