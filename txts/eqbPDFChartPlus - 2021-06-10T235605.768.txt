 Footnotes
 SI'MON LI'MON, forwardly placed outside foes tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch while shifting out four deep after the opening quarter,
 continued in that path through the backstretch, moved to challenge three deep racing into the far turn and continued with a steady effort to edge forward in
 time under firm left handed encouragement. KATIE FALOONA, urged along the rail prompting a rival's pace into the backstretch, conceded some ground to
 the pacesetter nearing the far turn, but continued willingly inside the eventual winner to contest the issue to late stages. LIL'S TURN bobbled at the start,
 was collected to track off the first flight between foes into the backstretch, was prompted to advance between foes racing into the far turn, shifted out racing
 into the lane to gain some position but lacked the needed final kick. EVERYWHEREILOOK, urged to the fore outside a rival racing into the first turn, dueled
 for command between foes to upper stretch and gave way. ENGLISH TOFFE ROSE exchanged bumps at the start, was settled last to the backstretch and
 proved no threat. RATTLE ROUSER exchanged bumps at the start, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders while shifting out five wide racing to the
 backstretch but soon emptied out. TAFFINA switched out racing into the first turn to make a brief bid three deep between rivals entering the backstretch but
 was spent after a half.

 Footnotes
 SEAN'S IDEA, forwardly placed between foes in the first flight in the opening stages, angled to the rail leaving the chute to attend the pace inside rivals, was
 prompted to challenge for command racing past the three furlong marker, went clear into the stretch and was kept to steady pressure.
 SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and continued with steady effort inside foes to prove best of the others.
 FLORA FANTASY, prominent four wide in the opening stages attending a rival's pace, continued three wide racing into the bend but couldn't produce the
 needed late response. NIKKI BELLA, urged from the outset to dispute the pace three wide between foes, shifted in to the two path dictating terms on a
 narrow margin racing to the turn and gave way once headed after a half. DON'T FIGHT IT was taken back early to track the leaders from just out of striking
 distance, shifted out racing into the lane but had no rally. CAUGHT UP IN YOU tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but faded early.

 WHISTLE ME HOME was urged to prompt the pace along the rail racing into the first turn, conceded the lead entering the backstretch to track the
 pacesetter along the inside, switched out after a half while coming under pressure to advance, continued in prolonged pursuit of the pacesetter to late
 stages and reeled in that rival nearing the wire to prevail under strong handling. MY COWBOY, urged to join the pace outside a rival racing to the first turn,
 gained the lead from between racing into the backstretch, shifted inwards dictating the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch but faltered nearing the wire.
 BROWNS GAP, urged to gain a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders, continued in that path into the far turn but weakened in late stages.
 STRONG COMPOSITION, reserved well off the second flight shifting off the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into the stretch and
 gained some position while no real threat. ALPHA TEAM tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half and steadily faded racing into the
 far turn. MEILLEUR was a brief factor tracking between foes in second flight but faded early. BLESSED AT MASS settled last and trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 MZ. FOO DO, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, stalked just off the first flight under light rating through the backstretch, shifted out three
 deep nearing the turn commencing a steady advance, gained the advantage midway through the turn, then held sway in that path to the end under firm
 handling and a few right handed taps. MORNING PRINCESS tracked the leaders outside foes from out of striking distance in the opening quarter, advanced
 four deep racing into the turn pursuing the eventual winner, angled inside that rival while moving to close the gap in the closing stages but proved only
 second best. PIPPAS POPPY, reserved off the second flight in early stages, shifted out five wide advancing to contention racing into the turn and continued
 to late stages with a mild bid. RETURN THE FAVOR tracked off the first flight inside foes in the opening quarter, shifted out to gain some position between
 foes, angled five wide in upper stretch but had no closing response. NO SNIVELING settled last, angled out racing into the stretch and split foes four wide to
 gain some position, finishing on even terms with a rival for fourth while making no real impression. MANCORA tracked the leaders between foes, angled

 Footnotes
 NATIVE HAWK tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, advanced on the pacesetter racing three wide into the turn, gained terms to press the issue
 in upper stretch and wrested the advantage in time under firm right handed pressure. SMALL FORTUNE joined the pace outside a rival pressing the issue in
 the opening stages, edged forward remaining a bit off the rail racing into the turn, resisted the winner's challenge to late stages but proved only second best.
 EPIC DRAMA, brushed at the start, tracked between foes just off the first flight, was urged to advance between foes racing into the turn gaining some
 position but had no closing bid. ANDREW THE BULL settled last along the inside racing to the turn, angled out nearing upper stretch but offered no rally.
 BACK PAGE broke inwards brushing EPIC DRAMA, was urged to dispute the pace along the inside racing into the turn and soon gave way.

 Footnotes
 CUESTION DE TIEMPO broke readily, angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing into the bend, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch
 steadily advancing to challenge for command, quickly went clear and held sway to the end under firm handling. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE raced unhurried in
 the opening stages tracking just off the second flight between foes, angled to the inside nearing the turn while commencing a steady advance, swung out
 four wide racing into upper stretch and finished willingly to prove best of the others. TACO tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, altered
 out four wide avoiding some traffic racing into the turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share.
 OUTRAGEOUS BET broke slowly, settled along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and gained some position in the closing stages
 while finishing evenly. BETTING ON RED tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening stages, shifted out racing into the turn while being prompted
 to advance, was fanned five wide between foes in upper stretch and had no final response. WELOVECANDY settled between foes off the second flight
 racing to the turn and never gained contention. J'S INDIAN CHARM, urged along the rail disputing the pace racing into the turn, dueled for command a bit
 off the rail between foes into upper stretch and gave way in late stages. COLONEL RED, caught five wide in the opening stages, angled in sharply while
 being urged to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn and gave way between foes nearing the lane.

 DO WHAT IT TAKES angled inwards to gain a position tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn, split foes nearing upper stretch advancing on the
 pacesetter and wore down that foe in a prolonged drive to prevail under firm handling. PLEASANT BUFFY urged to the fore while shifting off the inside,
 dictated the pace off the rail to upper stretch and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end. THEY CALL ME LUCKY, steadied out of tight quarters just after
 the start, dropped well back early, steadily regained position outside foes on the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to earn a
 share. AMERICAN GLORY, forwardly placed three deep prompting the pacesetter racing to the turn, weakened nearing upper stretch.
 BEACHTREASUREGIRL tracked off the second flight between foes just off the inside, advanced smartly shifting four wide racing into the turn to briefly loom
 outside the leaders but finished evenly between foes in that path late. MY COTTON CANDY settled between foes in the last flight, then gained some
 position splitting rivals just off the inside racing into the stretch but had no late kick. PRINCES DYNAMITE tracked off the second flight outside foes early,
 angled nearer to the inside racing into upper stretch gaining some position between foes but lacked the needed kick. MISS LOTUS FLOWER settled outside
 foes, raced wide to the lane and proved no threat. SHARPERTHANME settled near the inside and never seriously menaced. MARDI GRAS GIRL tracked
 off the second flight while shifting off the inside, was caught five wide racing into the turn but faded early. WINE BOTTLE angled sharply to the inside early
 tracking just off the first flight in the opening quarter but emptied out racing into the turn.

 Footnotes
 MAKEME DREAM gained a forward placing along the rail stalking the pacesetter under light reserve, continued under patient handling in that position into
 the far turn, came through when presented an opening racing into upper stretch to wrest command while shifting a bit off the inside and readily kicked clear
 under firm handling. STRELLA'S WAR tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide on the far turn advancing to
 challenge nearing upper stretch, continued with a steady bid into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. ROSSELLINI tracked the leaders just off
 the second flight along the inside under light reserve racing to the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing the lane, came through along the rail entering
 the lane to bid inside the top pair but was outkicked. SURPRISE AGAIN, reserved between foes just off the second flight in the opening half, shifted out
 splitting foes to advance four wide into the far turn, continued in that path to upper stretch but finished evenly late. HANIEL, urged to the fore in the opening
 stages, dictated the pace along the rail into the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch and abruptly gave way. LUNA tracked the leaders outside
 foes off the second flight while four deep after a half, was caught five wide racing into the far turn and soon faded. ALYDARIUS settled last racing to the
 backstretch and never gained contention. NAUGHTY SHIRLEY tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival under light rating for a half, was prompted to
 advance between foes nearing the lane but quickly emptied out racing into the stretch.

 Footnotes
 BIZNESS BEAUTY, bumped at the start, was rated outside foes tracking off the second flight through the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention three
 wide on the far turn, moved to challenge the pacesetter while shifting out four wide midstretch and went clear late under firm encouragement. KELCIE'S
 MANDATE, reserved along the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the far turn, gathered momentum while shifting out four wide racing into upper
 stretch and produced a steady late response to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. CLASSY OF COURSE broke outwards bumping the eventual
 winner, was urged to gain a clear advantage while angling to the inside on the first turn, set the pace to upper stretch but weakened leaving the furlong
 marker. WHISPERING WANDA tracked off the second flight between foes, shifted outside foes to advance four wide on the far turn, was fanned five wide
 into upper stretch and finished evenly late. V K LEGACY tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the far turn and gave way into the stretch.
 VUYELWA settled between foes in the last flight early and never gained contention. THORCERESS settled last along the inside early and failed to menace.
 AND I KNOW tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half but faded early. RACHIELY'S DREAM, forwardly placed along the rail tracking
 just off the pacesetter, emptied out leaving the far turn.
