 PANSHIR was chasing the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, was a threat to mid stretch then got outfinished. STRATUS BIRD bumped the
 winner at the start, pressed the pace two wide to the stretch but was weakening late. CLEAN LIVING also chased the leaders two wide to the stretch then

 BLUE DIVA was settled for a half mile, circled four wide on the second turn, rallied when set down and closed determinedly to get up in time. CASH FOR
 CASS went right to the front, set all the pace, was two wide on the second turn, kicked away to mid stretch but was tiring late and got tagged on the wire.
 CHERLYNN had no speed, trailed to the second turn, swung out three wide into the stretch and finished willingly but too late. CHAMP FOR JUSTICE
 pressed the pace to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. CUTIE LEAH was never a factor.

 QUEENOFTHEROAD was settled to the half, raced inside on the second turn, was blocked behind LITTLE BIT LOVELY in mid stretch, checked then found
 room between rivals, rallied and pushed to the front. MOONLIGHT MYSTIQUE was unhurried to the second turn, bid three wide then was caught off heels
 at the quarter pole, waited, eased out but was blocked, tried to split rivals leaving the furlong grounds, again was blocked, shifted out and surged in the final
 hundred yards. HIJRA (IRE) was settled to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch then continued to respond through the drive and was nailed on
 the line for the place. LITTLE BIT LOVELY set the pace early then kicked away to the half, saved ground to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then got
 outfinished late. BISHOPS OF COMPTON was also chasing the pace, raced two wide to the stretch, remained a threat to mid stretch then weakened. R U
 TOUGH ENOUGH was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch but gave out in the drive. WRECKHOUSE
