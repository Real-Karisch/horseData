 OMACHE KID broke in a tangle, raced unhurried early, advanced from off the rail through the turn, reached THAT'S GOLD with a furlong to run and edged
 clear of that rival. THAT'S GOLD dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch and gave way
 grudgingly. KID TRICKEY hopped at the start, disputed the pace from between rivals, raced four-wide through the turn and gave way through the final
 furlong. GIO STAR showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and did not threaten. MEETMEATTHEBAR
 was away in good order to vie for the early advantage while racing five-wide and weakened after going a half. HALO HERO settled off the leaders early,
 raced four-wide through the turn, angled in approaching the stretch and weakened in the drive.

 PERFECT NIGHT was away alertly then reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the lane and again in mid-stretch, reached the fore
 with a sixteenth to run and drew off with complete authority. BOB IS BACK was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, advanced from off the rail through the
 turn, angled in with a furlong to run and out nearing the sixteenth pole and was up for the place. LORD WALTON sprinted clear soon after the start, raced
 three-wide while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and gave way to his stable-mate through the final sixteenth. STRAIGHT
 BOURBON hopped at the start then was forwardly place, raced four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. LOTS OF PRAYERS
 chased the leaders from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. CADDY SHACK CAT chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened

 Footnotes
 UNBROKEN CODE tracked the pace of FEARLESS FIONA from off the rail, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore with a furlong to run, quickly
 opened a clear lead and held BELLA COLOMBA safe late. BELLA COLOMBA settled off the leaders early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out
 further in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. FEARLESS FIONA sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way to
 the winner through the final furlong. TAYLOR'S ROSE settled off the leaders throughout and finished evenly in the drive. IT'S MY KNIGHT raced off the
 pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. BERNETTE was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in
 mid-stretch and did not menace. SOPHIE DOPEY broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. CASSIDY
 COMMAND was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. POLLY ESTER POMPOM lacked early foot,
 saved ground throughout and did not reach contention.

 energy. BARASSO chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. UZTA HAVE MONEY was off a step slow, raced
 unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and found his best stride late. CECIL THE CAT settled off the leaders
 early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to rally. DON'TBESHYWILLIE raced off the
