 Footnotes
 CASTLE CASANOVA four wide in pursuit, came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, came in slightly nearing the quarter pole before being angled
 out five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining through the final eighth to take command inside the sixteenth marker, then inched
 away to the wire kept to task. DEPUTY FLAG broke in a step at the start bumping GIVETHEMAN A CIGAR, established the front and showed the way in
 hand just off the inside through moderate splits safely in front, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three then two wide into upper stretch, dug
 in clear to the eighth pole before coming under growing threat through the final furlong, got collared inside the sixteenth pole and ran on to secure the place
 honors clear of the rest. BAD GUY four to five wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing tucked two to three wide at the three-eighths, swung five to
 six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid for the show honors. GIVETHEMAN A CIGAR bumped at the start by DEPUTY FLAG, chased just off the
 inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths, was in the midst of advancing mildly to the inside of NUEVA YORK when that
 rival came inwards steadily from slight pressure by CASTLE CASANOVA nearing the quarter pole, got forced to check out when impeded along the inside
 losing momentum and swung three wide into upper stretch put to urging once more, improved position by a tired foe for the last major share. NUEVA YORK
 three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, came in squeezing out the aforementioned foe nearing the
 quarter pole forcing that rival to check, spun just off the inside for home and tired. SCRUTINIZE chased just off the inside, tucked inside put to coaxing half a
 mile from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

 Footnotes
 SATIN SHEETS disputed the pace from between rivals during the opening panel, responded to instructions from the pilot and was successfully eased back,
 tipped to the outside coming up the half mile pole, departed that station three to four wide, keeping watch on a three-way scrunge for the top a short
 distance up ahead, picked up interest when let out a notch past midpoint and narrowed in, challenged in earnest spinning approximately four wide into the
 stretch, fought her way by ELIZABETH NICOLE to begin the final furlong leading by a slim margin, edged away. ELIZABETH NICOLE away without
 apparent mishap, contended as the widest of three from path three for a good portion of the initial half, shook free as the second split was being finalized,
 was called upon getting pounced upon by the eventual winner soon afterwards, relinquished deep into the furlong grounds, held on to salvage second.
 OVERNEGOTIATE set up in path two after the field had been sent on its way, fought for the top from between rivals for much of the opening half, was put to
 a drive for the drive home, drifted out in a steadfast manner while backing away. HAVANA AFFAIR rode the rail for nearly a half, fanned five wide, the
 widest of all, into the stretch, altered course a few paths closer to the rail in the vicinity of the sixteenth marker eluding an errant OVERNEGOTIATE, made
 no impact. RIBBONITE along the rail vying as the innermost of three until late on the bend, faltered.

 Footnotes
 FAIR LASSIE sparred for command from path two, was put to encouragement settling into upper stretch, responded and kicked clear. DELTA GAMMA off
 the inside throughout, sat within striking distance three wide during the run around the bend, came under a ride tipping one path farther off the rail into the
 stretch, proved no match. TOO MANY TALES split rivals shortly after the start to assume a forward position, slid over to the rail, went at it matched up with
 the eventual winner to the outside, kept pace until upper stretch before weakening into the show slot. STERLING BEAUTY cut over to the inside after the
 start, tracked the front runners, stationed at a slight distance from off the inside, was put a hand ride for a furlong beginning from the seven-sixteenths
 marker, then paused being rated for the next furlong, was now in path two when put to a drive at the three-sixteenths marker, made some headway in the
 final stages. KATHY'S CAUSE broke in line with the second place finisher, led briefly before being allowed to drop back into a stalking role, tipped to the
 outside, sprung from the half mile pole three to four wide, got sent to the outside entering the stretch, winding up five to six wide, gave way. TOPLINE
 sluggish during the early going, was three wide entering the turn and five wide exiting it, had no rally. BARBARA P dashed over to the rail after the start,
 never made her presence off the ground-saving journey that followed. DETECTIVE KID took up the chase towards path two on the bend, came
 approximately five wide into the stretch, failed to menace.

 Footnotes
 ALRAHAAL forwardly placed six paths off the inside down the backstretch outside a trio, tucked three wide into the turn, advanced to pressure HURACAN
 before taking narrow command at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe
 to prevail. SOMEBODY chased just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a
 mild kick to secure the place honors cutting into the winner's margin in the late stages. SEEDISKID brushed the near side stall at the start, chased seven
 paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field, came under coaxing five to six wide at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into
 upper stretch and kept on to garner the show honors. SHILOH LANE bumped at the start by RACING RAVEN who broke outwards, chased five wide under
 coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the drive. RACING RAVEN broke out at the start
 bumping SHILOH LANE, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. HURACAN
 vied from the five path among a quartet latched on to one another early on, emerged with sole command tucking to the two path and coming under pressure
 to the outside from ALRAHAAL into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got displaced from command with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off
 the inside for home and tired. SUPPORT OUR CAUSE vied from the four path early on among a quartet, tucked inside half a mile from home, gave chase
 along the inside through the turn fading under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. WELL IN TUNE brushed the off
 side stall at the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung three wide for home and tired. GARSOON showed brief speed
 from the three path vying early on among a foursome, retreated nearing the half mile pole, came under coaxing four wide at the seven-sixteenths, swung
 five wide into upper stretch and faltered.

 Footnotes
 H MAN away forwardly placed, found himself engaged for the top with HALLOWEEN HORROR right from the get-go, inched his way into path three as the
 twosome raced on near even terms with each for the opening half, was eased onto two path in time for the commencement of the run around the bend,
 drew away steadily from the nemesis from the seven-sixteenths marker to the quarter pole, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when set down,
 emerged a sixteenth down the road in possession of his largest advantage, squandered much of it late but held on safely. RO BEAR bumped and knocked a
 bit sideways shortly after the start, underwent a three wide pursuit, had already been under a drive for over a sixteenth prior to spinning into the stretch,
 gained ground belatedly on a winner with just enough left itself to have gotten the job done. GLENCAIRN departed the backstretch from path four, was
 under strong handling swinging about as wide into the lane, failed to muster up the needed response and settled for the show. HALLOWEEN HORROR
 asked briefly for some run after springing from the gate, was along the rail dueling for control until the seven-sixteenths marker, steadily fell back from that
 station to the end of the bend, stepped into the stretch and made no headway en route to earning the last major check by the barest of margins. SPARTY
 BOY underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, proceeded to come in after taking an awkward initial step, bumped with PRETENTIOUS then induced that foe
 to move slightly to the inside too, then made contact again, got guided into path two by the conclusion of the backstretch, shifted into path six from upper to
 midstretch, gained mildly but without impact. TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK angled over into the two path approaching the half mile pole, was fanned out seven
 wide after stepping into the stretch, lacked the needed response. PRETENTIOUS squeezed after significant contact in the shadow of the starting gate, went
 over to the inside, had already been under some urging travelling on the turn when set down in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, arrived into
 the stretch and backed away. SWIVEL sighted two wide at the top of the turn, displayed only brief speed.

 Footnotes
 ROAMING UNION forwardly placed just off the inside through the opening bend, settled three wide in closest aim of the leader in hand applying pressure
 solely through his presence to the outside, advanced to apply genuine pressure half a mile from home tucking to the two path, got on near even terms near
 the three-eighths before seizing narrow command inside that station, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, edged
 clear under a drive to prevail. G ZAP three wide through the first turn, settled four wide in the clear down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked three wide
 half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, continued three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors in
 the last strides while never threatening the winner. FELIX IN FABULA coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way inside through the
 first turn before taking to the two path down the backstretch under rating through sensible splits and under accompaniment to the outside from ROAMING
 UNION facing little pressure, had that rival begin to apply direct pressure advancing half a mile from home and tucked inside in response before being put to
 coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, got headed just inside the three-eighths, chased inside and cut the corner into upper stretch, got shaken off by the top
 one weakening in the late stages and was caught for the place honors in the final jumps. MILLS coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside through the
 first turn before giving chase two to three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide
 into upper stretch, kept on through the stretch but was outkicked. LET ME GO FIRST just off the inside through the first turn, was under a hard hold off the
 heels briefly of ROAMING UNION into the backstretch before racing three to four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, continued three to four wide through
 the far turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. LANGDARMA chased just off the inside until tucked inside
 half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

 Footnotes
 HOPPER DROPPER assumed a prominent position after the start, went over into the two path, hitched up to the leader shortly after stepping off the
 backstretch, went onward then began to whittle away at the deficit late on the bend, spun into the lane trailing only by a long neck, was in the vicinity of the
 three-sixteenths pole before being set to a drive, put away the nemesis during the rest of the going to the furlong pole and edged clear. CHANGE OF
 VENUE made contact with INFIELD IS IN right after the start, required several jumps after the incident before settling into stride, took up the chase from
 mainly path two on the turn, got maneuvered into path six from upper to midstretch, displayed some late energy procuring the place. BUSS THE BELL was
 held in reserve taking up the chase two to three wide on the turn, got cued up coming up to the three-sixteenths marker, cleared a couple of foes before
 altering over to the rail in midstretch, flattened out. INFIELD IS IN brushed from both sides at the start, picked it up a bit approaching the conclusion of the
 backstretch, was in path three travelling on the turn, began to get sent to the outside leaving the five-sixteenths marker, straightened away towards path
 seven by midlane, ventured onward, missed out on third. LAURA'S POSSE established the front end in short order, cut over to the inside, showed the way,
 spaced at a slight distance from off the rail and with the winner putting on the pressure to the outside, was called upon when put to the test as the half was
 being completed, relinquished soon afterwards, then backed away steadily in the last eighth. LA MAQUINA GRIS brushed at the start, sat within range from
 path two for the opening half and gave way. MICKEY T made no impact off a ground-saving journey. IMVROS PRIDE lost his footing after brushing into the
 left side of the gate, got guided over to the rail, was under a brisk hand ride proceeding along the backstretch, continued to take the inside route on the turn,
 arrived into the stretch, had no rally. PANTHER CREEK off the inside throughout, was under urging racing three wide on the turn, had little left by the
 three-sixteenths pole and retreated.
