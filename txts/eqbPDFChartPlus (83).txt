 Footnotes
 NTH DEGREE, just off the rail throughout, took the lead leaving furlong grounds then drew off. WISHFUL QUALITY, four wide dueling for the lead, was no
 match for winner. RUMOR RIDGE raced wide and lacked a rally. ZIRA broke slowly, saved ground early,, split rivals near quarter pole then faded. SALLY
 O'PRADO broke slowly then raced very wide. SHE'S PRIMO set pace just off rail then faded through final furlong. SWEET TURN, wide early, moved closer
 to rail through stretch but wasn't a serious threat. OFFLEE OPTIMISTIC, two wide and just off the pace, tired. AUSSIE MIST broke sharply then quickly fell
 back. WILDCATTIN, between foes, was never a serious threat.
