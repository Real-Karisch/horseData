 ROMEO'S STORM seized command from the outset, was challenged on the far turn, responded to pressure entering the stretch and edged clear. GOOSE
 TOWN stalked, moved closer on the far turn, proved no match and stayed on. FOOLS RUSHIN settled while four wide, moved five wide at the top of the
 stretch and managed a mild rally. LANOITON off slowly, was reserved, lodged a five wide bid on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. THATS
 INCREDIBLE bobbled at the start, saved ground and was no factor.

 Footnotes
 INCITEMENT raced in striking position while five wide, lodged a four wide bid on the far turn, took over at the quarter mile marker and dug in gamely under
 steady right-handed pressure to hold THREE PADRES safe. The latter attended the pace while along the inside, was outpaced on the far turn, responded to
 a stiff drive in the stretch and stayed on well. ROLEX BOUND forced the early pace, was taken back on the far turn, angled four wide for the stretch run and
 finished willingly. DISTANT THOUGHTS vied between foes, gained a narrow lead up the backstretch run and came up empty in the stretch. CARIBBEAN
 COWBOY was forwardly placed and weakened. RUNAWAY BLING showed early speed, lost his position on the far turn and proved no factor in the stretch.
 COWBOYSTEVIEWONDER took no part.

 Footnotes
 GRASS AND CACTUS forced the pace, took over up the backstretch run and drew away in the stretch. GRONKINATOR reluctant to load, was rank around
 the first turn, lacked room when running up on the heels of the pacesetters at the six furlong marker, was steadied as a result, hampered CAT GOT EVEN
 when veering out, settled afterwards and offered a mild bid. CAT GOT EVEN threw his head at the seven-eighths marker, was checked when bumped at the
 six furlong marker and lodged a mild four wide rally in the stretch. TOMS KOWBOY passed tiring rivals. CROSBY saved ground to no avail. ODDS ON
 FAVORITE never menaced. DISCREETLY A PRIZE raced forwardly while five wide and weakened. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS
 CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE FIRST HALF MILE OF THE RACE. AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, GRONKINATOR WAS
 DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED THIRD.

 Footnotes
 CALLME MR MISTER raced forwardly while three wide, moved closer on the turn, responded to pressure and edged clear in the stretch. ADDED
 ATTRACTION gained the early lead, held well into the stretch and was no match late. TAPITIFYOUDARE settled while four wide, lodged a five wide bid on
 the turn, continued five wide into the stretch and managed a mild bid. GREENCASTLE TAP chased while four wide and lacked a rally. KALEBS MINE failed
 to threaten. RUSHIN TO JUDGE forced the pace and weakened. STORMY GALAXY was outrun. MARK'S THE MAN never menaced. CLASSIC IRISH
 raced in striking position for three furlongs and faltered.
