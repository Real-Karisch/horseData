 Footnotes
 JANUARY WON settled into the two path after the field had been sent off and running, pursued the pace from between rivals for the majority of the run
 around the bend, stepped onto the head of the stretch, narrrowed in, shoe-horned itself in between the ones to catch inside the sixteenth pole, wrested
 away the advantage in the final forty yards and shook free. BEYOND GONE got steadied shortly after the start as DAN THE MAN CAN was tucking along
 the inside route himself, kept watch on that opponent from the pocket, waited for options late on the bend, continuing to draft behind the pacesetter, caught
 sight of clear sailing in the two path a sixteenth later and eagerly shifted into it, struck the front just inside the eighth pole, got overhauled in deep stretch, but
 easily saved second. DAN THE MAN CAN established the top after being hard ridden early on the backstretch, cut over to the rail prior to departing the
 backstretch, carved out the pace, attended by JUSTINEINTIMEFORWINE from the outside, got pounced upon by the second place finisher at the
 three-sixteenths marker, yielded approximately a sixteenth down the road, was taken in hand getting overtaken by the winner in deep stretch then
 weakened into the show slot. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE pressed the pace from the two path, spun into the lane driving, gave way. JAMFLOWMAN sat
 forwardly placed three wide, came up empty when asked for more early during the stretch drive. NINTH OF APRIL travelled three to four wide on the bend,
 was fanned out five wide from upper to midstretch, had no offering.

 Footnotes
 MY ITALIAN RABBI fractious in the gate prior to the start, got away well and pressed the pace of FIERCE LADY to the outside three wide down the
 backstretch and then from the two path through the turn getting on near even terms three furlongs from home, dueled through the latter portion of the bend
 under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive knocking heads through to the finish and gamely got up on the
 wire by a nostril to prevail. FIERCE LADY a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start inspired by the small uproar by the aforementioned foe, broke on top
 and showed the way from the two path in hand under pressure from the outside by MY ITALIAN RABBI, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under
 light coaxing three furlongs out as her main pace rival advanced to be on near even terms, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in dueling through to the
 finish clinging to the lead until the final strides while fighting game through to the wire. JEWEL OF ARABIA chased along the inside, had the aforementioned
 foe tuck in front near the half mile pole and was briefly steadied as that rival made the maneuver, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off
 the inside for home before tipping to the three path straightened away, got shaken off as the top pair widened to the eighth pole, dug in to rally willingly and
 secure the show honors while cutting into the embattled top duo. CLASSY SADIE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
 spun three wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. TIME LIMIT stumbled badly at the start to her knees and recovered
 veering outwards, the rider keeping a strong balance to remain onboard his charge, tucked three then two wide down the backstretch at the tail of the field,
 came under coaxing past the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

 HE'S NO LEMON dropped back early then was unhurried at the rear while saving ground, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, gained in the two path on
 the final turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead just inside the furlong marker and proved best under strong urging.
 EXTRORDINARY JERRY tracked the pace while racing three wide, was asked late on the backstretch, made a bid on the final turn, took the lead into upper
 stretch, led into the final furlong but was overtaken while just able to get the place. CHANNEL ISLAND was rated just off the pace on the inside, came under
 urging near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the final turn, swung three wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. CAROM was reserved
 on the outside while racing four wide, came under urging late on the backstretch, went four wide on the final turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in
 near the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. EVERYONELOVESJAMES went to the front, set the pace under a snug hold in the two path, was
 asked while under threat on the final turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. TRINITY (FR) was hard held while keen in the two path on
 the first turn then rated off the pace, continued in the two path under restraint through the second turn, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was asked while
 four wide on the final turn, dropped back into the stretch and came up empty. (Rail at 9 Feet)

 Footnotes
 CITY MAN departed the backstretch from path four, flashed interest late on the bend, was hand ridden swinging into the lane, came up to the
 three-sixteenths pole and got asked for much more, gave the desired response, began to shift to the inside assuming the top, resulting in the pilot grabbing
 hold with approximately a sixteenth remaining, kept a truer course afterwards and kicked clear. SHANDIAN the quickest out of the starting gate, retained the
 advantage, cut over towards the rail, showed the way spaced at a slight distance from off the inside, tailed by IMPERIO D to the outside, settled in upper
 stretch and was set down, got collared in the general area of the sixteenth pole, held on willingly to salvage second. TURBO DRIVE set to a brisk hand ride
 after stumbling badly at the start, rushed up along the rail into a forward posiition, stayed within striking distance to midstretch, made no late headway.
 IMPERIO D stalked the pacesetter two to three wide, got let out approaching the quarter pole, backed away steadily down the stretch. FLY FLY AWAY
 reserved three wide, had no rally. BARLEEWON took up the chase at or near the inside route, got roused angling to the outside at the five-sixteenths
 marker, began the final furlong in path six, as the widest of all, made no impact. DIANNESIMPAZIBLE rated along the inside until the quarter pole, went
 three wide into the stretch, lacked a response. POWER UP PAYNTER raced in hand between rivals from path two on the turn, was in traffic behind rivals
 late on the bend, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, had no rally. TAPIZEARANCE stutter-stepped its way out of the gate after brushing with
 left side of it, spotting the compeition a four to five length headstart, worked out a tuck into the two path nearing the conclusion of the backstretch after being
 out in the middle of the strip prior, got spotted one path farther off the rail at the top of the lane, failed to make his presence felt.

 Footnotes
 SMOOTH WITH A KICK brushed lightly between foes at the start, settled just off the inside through the first turn in mid pack, remained unhurried down the
 backstretch and into the far turn, tipped out three wide nearing the seven-sixteenths, came under light coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced to issue a
 challenge through the latter portion of the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch seizing command straightened away, drew clear under a drive to prevail.
 GIRLFRIEND ROCKET three wide into the first turn, settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, tipped three wide at the half mile pole, came under
 coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild bid to safely secure the
 show honors. WE ARE FAMILY intent on the lead from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under attendance from
 SARA SEA to the outside through solid splits, shook off that rival inside the half mile pole briefly shaking away before coming under growing threat to the
 outside placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the late
 stages while along for the show honors. HIGHTAILING settled two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three wide three furlongs from
 home, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to improve position in the stretch. KELLEYCANRUN chased along the inside through the
 first turn and down the backstretch, tipped two to three wide near the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide at the top of
 the stretch and tired. ESTILL just off the pace just off the inside in pursuit, came under urging nearing the quarter pole, went three wide at that station into
 upper stretch and faltered. SARA SEA broke outwards under coaxing brushing the off side stall at the start, raced forwardly placed three then two wide
 through the opening bend before settling three wide in closest aim of the leader through a solid opening half mile, came under very light coaxing nearing the
 far turn, got shaken off by the leader and retreated steadily through that bend to the rear of the field with five-sixteenths to go, swung three to four wide into
 upper stretch under a light hold tired and was eased through the stretch.

 LAUGHING MANNERS disputed the pace between horses then inside early on the turn, dropped back outside the three-eighths, angled three wide at the
 five-sixteenths, advanced to re-bid on the outside in upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging.
 DEPUTY FLAG disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path early on the turn, moved clear approaching the three-eighths, was challenged while
 under a drive in upper stretch, dueled with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. CHUCKLES broke a step slow,
 settled towards the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy for the show. SOBERSICK N
 SORRY lost his footing at the start, was coaxed along on the inside of a rival, went two to three wide on the turn, was crowded near heels around the
 three-eighths then roused inside that marker, held a reasonable striking position into upper stretch but lacked the needed response. BULWARK broke a step
 slow, was urged along at the rear of the field, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LORCAN was coaxed
 along on the outside, came under stronger encouragement while three to four wide on the turn and failed to respond. BIG WONDER disputed the pace on
 the inside of two foes, was hard held while pinched back near the half-mile pole, chased inside to the two path on the turn and came up empty.

 Footnotes
 VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) sat reserved two to three wide on each bend, was fanned out into path five during the initial portion of the stretch, kicked in
 when given its cue and closed in, went at it eye to eye with the winner in the final stages and got up. SWAMP RAT prompted the pacesetter from the two
 path, had already assumed the advantage when let out at the three-sixteenths piole, mustered up good determination coming under heavy pressure in the
 final stages, came out a bit in the shadow of the wire, got nailed. KADAR saw the pilot take hold, getting pinched right after the field had been sent off and
 running, went three wide stepping onto the backstretch, was in the same path departing it, was cued up angling towards path six for clearance in upper
 stretch, came home with strong late foot down the center of the course to secure the show. SPIRIT ANIMAL within range in the two path for six furlongs,
 swung out towards path four for the drive home, was between opponents rallying, steadied off the heels of a shifting SWAMP RAT in the final seventy yards,
 never re-gained any interest. KID LEMUEL kept watch from the pocket, got called upon after three-quarters had been rattled off, spun three wide into the
 lane, put in his best shot over the course of the ensuing furlong then flattened out. SHOOTIN THE BREEZE darted over to the rail, cut the corner into the
 stretch, lacked a response. MAGNIFICENT MCCOOL at or near the inside taking up the chase, got spotted in the two path for the drive home, had no rally.
 KING OTTOKAR pursued the pace from path two, never made his presence felt. UNCLE BULL set the pace from the inside, got turned loose stepping into
 the stretch, relinquished control and faltered. JEROME AVENUE saved ground to no avail.

 HOFBURG along the inside shortly after the start, was taken in hold briefly into the first turn as FLOWERS FOR LISA crossed over from the outside, settled
 under a light rating hold tracking the front just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked along the inside following the leader half a mile from home, came
 under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced through the latter portion of the turn and swung two to three wide into upper stretch, came out slightly bumping
 ROAMING UNION at the three-sixteenths, took over command a furlong from home and edged clear to the finish, the stick put away through the final
 sixteenth. ROAMING UNION forwardly placed three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three to
 four wide into upper stretch, got bumped at the three-sixteenths as the aforementioned foe came out slightly, proved no match for that rival late while
 running on to be along clear for the place honors. FLOWERS FOR LISA coaxed from the gate, established the front and crossed to show the way in hand
 just off the inside through a sensible half mile, tucked inside into the far turn placed to light coaxing quickening the pace, came under urging nearing the
 quarter pole under threat from a pair, spun just off the inside for home, dug in and was displaced a furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. PROVEN
 RESERVES under rating just off the inside through the first turn, settled three wide in pursuit patiently handled down the backstretch, came under coaxing
 three to four wide at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. ROYAL ALBERT HALL (GB) got lightly pinched after the start
 due to pressure outside, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing two to three wide at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
 stretch and trailed throughout.

 KEPT TRUE stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, took the lead while four wide into the stretch,
 kicked clear at the three-sixteenths and was fully extended to last. HAY FIELD settled on the outside, was roused while four wide on the turn, came five
 wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside and closed well to just miss while clear for the place. TIMELY TRADITION settled off the pace, raced in the two
 path while between horses on the turn, was asked for her best into upper stretch and finished willingly for the show. SUNSHINE GAL bumped with a rival
 after the start, was reserved near the back then taken up near the half-mile pole, came under urging while three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in
 upper stretch and improved position. FOREVER CHANGED bumped with a rival at the start then bumped with foes on both sides shortly thereafter, moved
 in while settling off the pace, went two then three wide while asked on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
 BERTRANDA chased the pace on the outside, went three wide on the turn and tired. CAMORRA moved in then was well placed just off the pace, chased
 inside on the turn and came up empty. HIGH JINGO showed good speed and set the pace, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked nearing the
 quarter-pole, lost the lead into the stretch and gave way. TUDOX LIFTING OFF bumped twice with a foe at the start, settled towards the rear, went four wide
 on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
