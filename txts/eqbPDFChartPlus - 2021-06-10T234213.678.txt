 Footnotes
 HIDE AND STREET stalked the pace setters from the three path while in between horses, made a three wide bid passing the quarter pole, reached the lead
 just inside the eighth pole and drew off. MIGHTY MINI made an early inside rush to press the pace setter from the two path, forged a narrow lead from the
 early leader into the stretch, but was caught by outer closing rival inside the eighth pole while staying on her wrong lead. SICCAR raced in the five path
 down the backstretch, stalked while three wide around the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and made no gain. LOVE THE POWER (FR) rushed
 through after a lackluster start, cleared off, received a challenge from MIGHTY MINI for the lead into the turn, was headed by that rival in upper stretch and
 weakened. ALLURING APPROVAL chased four wide, was shuffled back while in tight quarters into far turn, then faltered. RULELIKECLEOPATRA settled
 far back, raced in the five path early, angled three wide around the turn, but never gained and made no impact.

 Footnotes
 KAMACHA dueled inside, drew off from rival into turn, clear into the stretch, held sway while driving. WHY STOP NOW settled far back, strong rail gain
 around turn, sustained bid to reach a striking position in upper stretch, but was second best. HART HALL dueled two wide but was hustled into the turn and
 lost position, lost 3rd into the stretch, but regained it at the wire. AW NAW chased two wide between horses, hesitated slightly passing the half mile pole as
 HART HALL faltered in front of him, made an inside bid to reach third in upper stretch, but hung for that minor placing. NED'S ORBIT chased three wide to
 upper stretch but made no gain. RIGOLETTO was very slow into stride, raced very far back early and made a slight gain on tired rivals in the stretch.

 QUEEN OF CORONA pressured pace to turn, roused and responded well to run past leader in the final furlong. SPEARETTE dueled to the turn, edged off
 into the stretch but could not last in the final sixteenth. NATIVE INDY raced evenly to the stretch, moved to improve for the show spot. TENACIOUS SALLY
 raced back early, made a run to the turn, flattened out in lane. HERO OF THE BEST never a real factor. SOUR PEACH raced evenly to the stretch, no late
 kick while no threat. GLORY RANGE good speed to duel to the stretch but gave way readily for there.

 SANCTUAIRE SPOT pressed leader to turn, took over through the stretch and urged clear in the final sixteenth. JR'S JOY raced well off inside throughout,
 rallied along to just garner the place on the wire. SPIRIT WARRIOR sprinted clear at once, over taken in the stretch and nailed for the place spot on the
 wire. VILLA SAVINA (IRE) unhurried to turn, angled out for the drive and finished up well through the final furlong. SUE raced evenly, failed to respond in
 the stretch run. MIAMI AZUL chased pace for three quarters, gave way readily on empty. ON THE COME never a menace. MANDARINA had a steady fade.
 TSCHUDI'S GIRL had a bad break at the start, through early, dropped back. LITTLE T K was through early and stopped. ELEGANT ANGEL pinched back
 at the start, taken widest throughout and turned in a dull effort.

 Footnotes
 EL BONITO stalked the easy pace setter from the two path, was scrubbed on to gain into the far turn, made a two wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole
 and drew off through the stretch. DISCREETLY FIRM lunged at the start, quickly cleared, challenged by the winner approaching the quarter pole, was
 headed, then tired but held second. STREET FACTOR stalked inside, tipped outside of the leaders around the far turn, but made no gain on the leader
 through the stretch. MANSOOR sat midpack three to four wide, raced five wide down the backstretch and stayed on for a minor piece.
 LAFLOWMYLAXBRO gained ground along the rail down backstretch, rode the rail around the far turn but made no impact. ORIGAMI DOWNTOWN sat
 midpack in the four path between horses backstretch, then faltered. ROYAL BY NATURE (IRE) yielded to last into the backstretch and showed little.

 took over into turn, headed and stayed game for the show spot. HEBGONE rushed inside to duel to the turn, faltered in the stretch run.
 JENNYSREGALMAN broke outwards at the start, never a contender. BOASTFUL BOY never a real menace. BASIC HERO antsy in the gate, saved ground
 to the turn, gave way.
