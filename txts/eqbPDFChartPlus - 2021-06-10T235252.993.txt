 Footnotes
 FIGHTIN PHIL pressed the pace, went four-wide rallying on the turn, continued on willingly and was up in the final stride under strong urging. ULTIMATE
 BARONESS pressed the pace between horses, was bumped by HESGOTAWAYWITHWRDS near the half-mile pole, dueled on the turn, gained a short
 lead near the eighth pole, led to the final sixteenth, ducked out sharply then swerved left, was straightened and just missed. BISHI quickly took command,
 led into the final furlong and weakened. IN IT TO WIN was outrun. ATTRACTING pressed the pace early, steadied behind ULTIMATE BARONESS near the
 half-mile pole, went wide and lacked a rally. MAGICAL KISSER was no threat. HESGOTAWAYWITHWRDS pressed the early pace three-wide, ducked in to
 bump ULTIMATE BARONESS on the backstretch, dueled into the turn but weakened before the quarter pole. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY
 SIGN, VIEWED THE BUMPING ON THE BACKSTRETCH AND ALSO THE RUNNER-UP'S SWERVING IN THE STRETCH AND ALLOWED THE RESULT
 TO STAND.

 Footnotes
 DON'T BE SO SALTY quickly gained command, rated along clear to the stretch in the two-path, felt the whip twice from the eighth-pole to the
 sixteenth-pole, and coasted in comfortably. FOX ROX chased inside for a half-mile, could not menace the winner through the lane in the two-path, but was
 decidedly best of the rest. BLICHTON raced three wide and failed to rally. DANZIG STORM chased outside the winner for a half-mile and weakened.
 SEEKING THE BAY raced between horses early, shifted to the rail midway on the turn and was never a threat. FORWARD MOTION was finished after a
 half-mile three wide.

 AUNTIE MARY trailed to the second turn, rallied four-wide, was put to strong urging throughout the stretch and was up in the final stride. RED STARLET
 quickly took command, set a pressured pace to the stretch, drew off to a comfortable lead then shortened stride to just miss. AVENTINE HILL was well
 placed, attended the lead into the middle of the stretch but lacked the needed rally. LA PIU BELLA ducked out sharply at the start, pressed the pace to the
 stretch and weakened. MI SOUTHERN BELLA was outrun and had no response to hard urging. CHEERING FOR AL pressed the pace to the second turn
 and tired.

 SNAGGLETOOTH dueled outside MIAMI SMUGGLER in the three-path for a half-mile, lugged in driving clear through midstretch and held sway late.
 STATION ROCK raced three wide around the turn, came out further for the drive and finished well on the far outside. MIAMI SMUGGLER dueled inside
 SNAGGLETOOTH while slightly off the rail for a half, moved to the fence for the drive and kept on with good courage. STUNNING BABY tracked the
 leaders close-up from inside, altered course off the rail in midstretch and lacked a final bid. SUPER CAUSEWAY stayed in range around the turn two wide,
 and made no headway in the lane. STATELY MOONZAPPER broke slowly and did not factor through an inside trip. MY BLIND DATE raced three wide and
 was outrun.

 strong urging. CREATIVE STORY saved ground dueling to the stretch, drew clear and just failed to stay. TOMS ONTHEWARPATH raced in the middle of
 the pack and had a mild rally. ROYAL RUSE was outrun to the stretch and had a mild rally. SCIENCE TO WIN pressed the pace three-wide and tired in the
 upper stretch. TENKOZ dueled outside to the stretch and tired. DOUBLE RAINBOW hit the gate hard, was pulled up immediately and vanned off.

 NINETEENTH STREET trailed to the top of the stretch, angled to the far outside and rallied steadily to catch ANSWER MY CALL in the final strides.
 ANSWER MY CALL went along unhurried three wide for a half-mile, challenged outside her entrymate with a furlong to run, reached the front in deep
 stretch but was nailed near the wire. CACTUS COPY pressed the pace outside VELVET MOOD from the start, fought for command between that one and
 her mate through the furlong grounds, and was outkicked. VELVET MOOD sped clear early inside, stayed on through midstretch and was outkicked to the
 finish. LADY OAK (IRE) raced in striking range for a half-mile and lacked the needed late response inside.

 Footnotes
 I MISS YOU pressed the pace outside LEAVEM BRITTEN from the outset, wrested the lead after six furlongs, edged away into upper stretch and remained
 clear under a drive. GLOBAL WARNING saved ground early, lost position up the backstretch, shifted outside for the drive and rallied willingly. DIM SUM
 bumped with STARLA at the start, got squeezed back and checked between horses going under the wire the first time, put in a three-wide run around the
 far turn, but flattened out late. STARLA bumped with DIM SUM at the start, sat close-up reserved behind the leaders up the backstretch, raced two wide on
 the far turn and lacked a solid response. PURE PASSION raced in striking range three wide to the top of the lane, and had no rally. LEAVEM BRITTEN set
 the pace inside, could not fend off MISS YOU after six furlongs, and steadily gave way. HOLD THAT NOTE was reserved at the back inside early, moved up
 continuing on the rail into the far turn, checked inside STARLA near the five-sixteenths and could not recover. DUKE'S WILD GIRL was never prominent
 three wide. FOLLOWING A STEWARD'S INQUIRY CONCERNING THE RUN TO THE FIRST TURN, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF
 DIM SUM AGAINST GLOBAL WARNING, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
