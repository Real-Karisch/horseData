 Footnotes
 PALE HOSE, urged to the lead while angling inside, dictated terms on a comfortable margin into the turn, then just maintained the advantage to the end
 under firm encouragement. BOOM BOX tracked off the second flight inside foes in the opening stages, angled four wide into upper stretch and finished
 willingly to close the gap on the winner. HEY PRETTY BOY tracked between foes in second flight, then continued evenly in late stages. MEAN
 INTENTIONS settled last early, swung five wide into the stretch and made some mild progress. KYZAN, urged to a forward placing along the inside racing
 to the turn, faded into upper stretch. TYOGA SIX, off slowly, tracked off the second flight between foes into the turn but lacked a rally. I FORGOT IT'S
 NAME, caught four wide early tracking just off leaders into the turn, faded into upper stretch. HOLY BRASS flashed brief pace outside foes in the opening
 quarter and gave way into upper stretch.

 LIVE ROUND settled off the second flight in the opening stages, angled inside foes gaining position racing into the turn, shifted out to challenge three wide
 in upper stretch and wrested the advantage in time under firm encouragement. WAITING ON THUNDER settled outside off the second flight in the opening
 stages, angled inside on the turn, gained position while shifting four wide in late stages and finished willingly to prevail for second. BARTON ATTACK, urged
 to press the pace inside a rival into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. GRANDSLAMSURPRISE broke readily, forced
 the pace outside a rival racing into the turn to upper stretch but weakened late. TWO NEPHEWS dropped back early and failed to menace. READY

 Footnotes
 CHANTSES stalked just off the leaders inside a rival in second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch to challenge the pacesetter for
 command, gained a narrow edge from that foe midstretch and just held under firm encouragement. PERFECT DIAMOND moved to the fore along the inside
 to dictate the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch and grudgingly resisted the winner to the end. MISSION
 STORM settled along the inside in early stages, split foes nearing upper stretch, swung five wide entering the lane and continued with a mild bid while
 gaining a share. QUICK STUDY tracked off the second flight racing to the far turn, split foes to challenge three deep in upper stretch but had no final kick.
 BANJO CAT was guided inside early while dropping off the second flight, advanced inside foes along the rail to lodge a brief bid in upper stretch but
 flattened out late. LAUNCH AWAY settled between foes in early stages, was fanned five wide between rivals nearing upper stretch and lacked a rally. LADY
 TEMPLE settled outside foes early, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and proved no threat. COWGIRL TYNE settled last early and proved no factor.
 WAYAWAY, urged to gain a forward placing outside a rival tracking just off the first flight, lodged a brief bid three wide between foes on the far turn but
 came up empty in the drive. COCOA BANDITA, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way racing into
 upper stretch.

 Footnotes
 JAGUAR RIDGE angled to the rail early tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, advanced inside foes to challenge for command racing into
 upper stretch and edged clear under pressure. FRANCOIS settled off the second flight off the inside racing to the turn, then steadily gained position four
 wide between foes in late stages to edge a rival for second. THATS MYBUDDY BOY tracked just off the first flight three wide racing to the turn, bid between
 foes in that path entering upper stretch but had no final kick. W W DISTINCTION settled outside foes in the last flight, was fanned six wide into upper stretch
 and continued with a belated bid. OLTRE' ORO, off last, angled to the inside early, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and improved position between foes
 in that path to the end. GREENHORN, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival racing into the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch and soon gave way.
 SWIPERNOSWIPING settled into stride off the inside early and failed to menace. SHMILY tracked outside foes in second flight, raced four wide into the turn
 while making brief progress but quickly came up empty. GRAHM FROM ABOVE, bumped at the start, was righted quickly to force the pace outside a rival
 into the turn and gave way after a half.

 BOOTLEGGIN angled to the inside early dropping off the second flight, saved ground on the turn, gathered momentum while shifting out four wide nearing
 midstretch and continued with a sustained bid to prevail in time under firm encouragement. MY PAL AL tracked off the first flight between foes racing into
 the bend, advanced three deep in upper stretch to challenge, led between calls late and just missed. A J'S POSSE, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival
 from the outset, dueled for command past midstretch but yielded late. READY RIGHT NOW angled inwards a bit to track off the second flight between foes
 and improved position between foes late. KIELBASA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight early, shifted off the rail nearing the lane and faded
 between foes in the stretch. RICHIE ROCKS, urged to force the pace outside a rival from the outset into the turn, gave way leaving midstretch. MR.

 nearing the lane. BRITT'S VOW settled outside foes early and proved no threat. MIDNIGHT NOW soon retreated.

 CHARGE CARD was rated in hand inside foes stalking just off the first flight racing into the turn, was urged to bid for command along the rail when
 presented an opening nearing upper stretch, quickly went clear and widened to the end under a drive. SACRAMENTO Q tracked off the second flight in the
 opening stages, angled inside foes on the turn and advanced inside rivals into the stretch to edge a rival for the place honors in late stages. KID MAC
 COOL, urged to dispute the pace inside foes from the outset racing a bit off the rail into th turn, couldn't match the winner racing into upper stretch and gave
 way midstretch. REVERSALOFFORTUNE tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening stages, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch but had
 no late kick. DRAMA STAR was a brief factor outside foes in second flight racing to the turn but gave way into upper stretch. UNCLE PADDY settled
 between foes well off the leaders early and continued evenly. GEM CITY JEWEL settled near the inside early and proved no factor. HOLYCITYS MIRACLE,
 shuffled out of tight quarters at the start, proved no menace thereafter. BROTHER CESARE angled inwards while being urged along forcing the pace
 outside a rival into the turn, gave way after a half. PURRFECT KITTEN broke slowly, settled outside foes early and never menaced thereafter.

 Footnotes
 HURRICANE FORCE ducked outwards sharply at the start bumping ENCHANTED RAMBAM while forcing that foe into other rivals' paths, was righted to
 track off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out four wide nearing midstretch carrying out ADMIRAL SEAN but continued with a solid
 late kick to wrest command and hold safe ENCHANTED RAMBAM to the end under firm handling. The latter, bumped, then squeezed back out of tight
 quarters at the start, settled off the second flight while shifting out racing into the turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch but finished willingly to challenge
 the winner while being just outkicked. ADMIRAL SEAN tracked off the first flight outside foes racing into the turn, was carried out five wide midstretch while
 finishing with interest between foes but proved no match for the top pair late. DR. LIECHTY tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted three
 wide, then four wide in late stages and gained position between foes to the end. MATTHEW'S THUNDER, urged to force the pace outside a rival from the
 outset into the turn, gave way in late stages. HIGH MOON, caught in tight quarters at the start, was settled between foes in the last flight, then split rivals
 just off the inside in the closing stages with a belated effort. GO BEEJA, forwardly placed three wide stalking just off the leaders, lodged a brief bid in that
 path to strike the front midstretch but quickly flattened out. WILDCAT LITE came through tight quarters at the start, then was urged to dispute the pace
 inside a rival racing into the turn, then upper stretch but gave way in late stages. CONGRATS GIVEN, off slowly, trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 SHOBIZ STAR, urged to terms with the first flight inside rivals attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue along the rail into the far turn to gain
 a narrow advantage, forged clear racing into upper stretch while being kept to pressure and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided.
 GOLD HAWK settled in the last flight inside foes racing to the backstretch, swung out gathering momentum on the far turn, was fanned six wide into upper
 stretch but finished with interest to prevail for the place honors. CHICORY BLUE bobbled at the start, settled between foes in the last flight racing to the
 backstretch, shifted out nearing the lane to bid five wide between foes, altered course inside a drifting foe nearing midstretch and continued well enough to
 earn a share. URBAN COOL, gained terms with the first flight racing into the backstretch prompting the pace three deep, pressed the issue outside the
 eventual winner into the far turn and gave way in upper stretch. SUN BROWN, reluctant to load in the gate, was settled outside rivals in the last flight early,
 dropped out entering the backstretch, angled inside foes racing into upper stretch and gained position while making no impression. BAHNKE tracked the
 leaders outside a rival in second flight, shifted four wide nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance, then drifted out markedly through the stretch
 while giving way. COURT'S RULING tracked the leaders inside a rival in the second flight but steadily retreated after a half. VIKING vied for command
 between foes into the backstretch but gave way early.

 Footnotes
 B N A NATIVE GIRL, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals from the outset into the turn, shook clear into upper stretch, drifted out under left handed
 pressure but was righted while holding sway on a clear margin to the end. HAL'S MISCHIEF angled inwards to track between foes off the second flight
 racing into the turn, split rivals, then angled to the rail racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain the place honors. GREELEYS DELIGHT
 angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight, shifted out racing into upper stretch to split four wide in late stages while finishing with interest to
 secure a share. GREELEYS ANGEL, off slowly, was urged to position five wide, then four wide off the second flight racing into the turn, advanced in that
 path to challenge in upper stretch but flattened out late. HARANSTOWN tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, was caught five wide
 racing into the turn and finished evenly in that path in the closing stages. BUBBLE TIME, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace while angling inwards
 racing into the turn, gave way between foes late. WADDLE, off slowly, was settled outside foes off the second flight and made no impact. MIDNITE IN
 MIAMI tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. NEVAEHA'S RAIN, urged to gain a forward placing
 three deep tracking just off the first flight racing into the bend, gave way after a half. ILLINI KITTEN settled between foes early and proved no threat. JOSIE
