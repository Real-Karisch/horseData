 Footnotes
 HELD ACCOUNTABLE proceeded along one-paced bringing up the back of the pack during the opening half, slid onto the inside route at the top of the turn,
 flashed some interest when switched over to a light hand ride, paused behind another before committing to a course of action for the drive home, altered
 course into path four in two stages from upper to midsttretch, having gained both momentun and real estate by this juncture, wrested away the advantage in
 the general area of the sixteenth pole, then drew off smartly, under a hand ride crossing the finish line. FLAT CALM forwardly placed three wide along the
 backstretch, moved by ARCHUMYBABY and into path two shortly after entering the turn, was still held in reserve taking over as three-quarters was being
 completed, got called upon for more, was caught with approximately a sixteenth to go, had enough left to easily salvage second. CAUSE WE ARE LOYAL
 pursued the front runners while stationed three wide, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, made no late headway and had to settle for the
 show. PINK TWIST two to three wide taking up the chase on the turn, got put to a brisk ride by the five-sixteenths marker, lacked the necessary stretch
 response. COTTON CANDY CUTIE quickly set up in the pocket, kept watch on the front runners, pulling on the left side, was forced to remain under a snug
 hold from the end of the bend until the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, trapped in traffic, backed out of that tough racing luck by having the pilot check
 the mount, tipped out several paths afterwards, then continuing along under mild encouragement, managed to beat a pair of tiring opponents to the wire.
 RACHEL'S BLUE MOON showed the way from along the rail for six furlongs and faltered. ARCHUMYBABY pressed the issue two wide from between foes
 until the end of the backstretch, began to display signs of tiring by the three-eighths pole, finsihed the run to the end of the bend and retreated.

 Footnotes
 HIERARCHY tracked the pace just off the inside through the first turn before taking to the three path down the backstretch, remained patiently handled until
 put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying, came in under an off sided stick bumping CAROM
 offstride at the eighth pole when latching on the leader, knocked heads through to the finish and just got the nod on the wire to prevail. CHANTRY FLATS
 established the front and showed the way just off the inside through the opening bend before taking to the inside seven furlongs from home, backed the
 pace up steadily down the backstretch and had the field contract in behind, remained on hold until coming under challenge in earnest past the three-eighths,
 came under coaxing in response nearing the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home headed for command and got leaned on by CAROM
 straightened away, dug in taking back narrow command under threat to the outside, held stubbornly through to the finish but was nailed in the final jump.
 ARGONNE tracked just off the inside early on before taking to the inside under rating, was at times taken hold of in behind the leader when growing a tad
 eager, tipped to the two path three furlongs from home given some rein to work with, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on behind rivals to the
 eighth pole unasked, came under brief coaxing inside that station and improved position in the final strides to procure the show honors while never fully
 extended. NO MANS LAND two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch,
 kept on through to the finish but was outkicked by the top trio. MINI P (IRE) fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke a beat slow without incident, saved
 ground near the rear of the field, steadied off the heels of ARGONNE just inside the half mile pole, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, cut the
 corner into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid along the inside but was outfinished in the late stages. CAROM forwardly placed just off the inside through
 the first turn, advanced as the pace slowed to latch on the leader six furlongs from home briefly while unhurried attending the front, came under coaxing
 nearing the five-sixteenths, took over command swinging two to three wide into upper stretch, came in straightened away leaning on CHANTRY FLATS
 briefly when displaced from the front by that rival, got bumped off stride by HIERARCHY coming inwards under an off sided stick when between foes at the
 eighth pole and weakened in the late going.

 Footnotes
 FILLY JOEL away without apparent mishap, disptued the pace as the widest of a threesome for a good portion of the initial half, saw the innermost
 participant, that being CANTEEN, drop out of the contest coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, shifted closer to the rail then sparred to the outside
 of DOVEY LOVEY, had already taken over when asked for more spinning into the lane, gave the desired response and drew off. ALWAYS SHOPPING
 guided over to the rail in short order, was put to a ride after stepping onto the turn, got angled into path three coming up to the five-sixteenths marker, went
 on to maneuver a couple of paths wider in upper stretch, rider applying a snug grip on the right side while going about the task, kept a straight course once
 the rider release that grip, rallied well enough to procure the place. OFF TOPIC pursued the front runners from the four path on the turn, was about as wide
 exiting it, failed to keep pace with the winner then lost out late for second. CANTEEN set to some coaxing after springing from the starting gate, rushed up
 into a prominent position, was along the rail, contending for the top as the inner member of a three-way tussle for much of the opening half, dropped back
 slightly a short distance from the half mile pole, got sent out into path three from that station to the midway point on the turn, was moved slightly wider after
 entering the stretch, had no rally. INTROSPECTION brushed with IT JUSTHITTHE WIRE right after the field had been sent off and running, sneaked onto
 the inside approaching the end of the backstretch, remained along it in pursuit of the ones to catch from the top of the bend to its end, got drvien into path
 two for entrance into the stretch, made no impact. DOVEY LOVEY was between rivals contesting the pace during the opening phases, slid over to the rail
 afterwards to have a go at it one on one with the eventual winner, yielded after going three-quarters, steadily backed away down the stretch. IT
 JUSTHITTHE WIRE made some contact with INTROSPECTION after stumbling badly at the break, was two wide stepping onto the turn and sent four wide
 exitiing it, had no rally. SQUIBNOCKET sighted in path two at the half, failed to reach a contending position.

 DOUPS POINT just off the pace four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, advanced through the turn under coaxing
 from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive latched on the leader through the final furlong, took narrow command to be up
 late in the final strides to score. SCOTTY BROWN established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until
 roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat through the final furlong and was collared in the last jumps while holding for
 the place honors. KLICKITAT bumped after the start by PIER FORTY who came inwards and in turn bumpd AWESOME ADVERSARY into GRAY'S IMAGE
 and SOUTHERN BRIGADE, raced just off the inside in mid pack, got steadied tucking to the inside seven furlongs from home as SOUTHERN BRIGADE
 bobbled heavily in front nearly losing the rider, tracked along the inside patiently handled until put to coaxing cutting the corner into upper stretch, offered up
 a mild kick showing late interest in the final eighth to get up for the show honors. PIER FORTY came in after the start bumping the aforementioned foe into a
 trio of rivals, chased three to four wide in mid pack, briefly was taken in hand as SOUTHERN BRIGADE bobbled at the seven-eighths, came under coaxing
 three to four wide at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. ALPHASTEST saved ground forwardly
 placed just off the inside early on forwardly placed, backed off a bit nearing the far turn, tipped out three wide placed to coaxing three furlongs from home,
 swung two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. QUICK CHARGE three wide out of the dog tailed chute into the backstretch, had
 HERECOMESTHEJUDGE get out directly in front and altered to the four path forcing COACH VILLA to steady off his heels just inside one mile from home,
 raced three to four wide from just off the pace, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch
 offering up a mild bid to the eighth pole in behind the leader, then flattened out inside the final furlong to the finish. SOUTHERN BRIGADE bumped after the
 start off stride by GRAY'S IMAGE due to pressure begun by PIER FORTY who came inwards, settled two to three wide in mid pack, bobbled heavily just
 inside the seven-eighths tossing the rider from the saddle who remained on only through a show of remarkable agility to grasp the neck of his charge and
 right himself in the saddle as a trio of foes steadied and altered to the inside and behind him, dropped to near the rear of the field and went three wide
 through the far turn, came under light coaxing angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to improve position in the stretch
 after a rough go of it to split the field. COACH VILLA three wide near the rear, got forced to steady off the heels of QUICK CHARGE as that rival altered
 from the getting out HERECOMESTHEJUDGE one mile from home, steadied once more in behind the aforementioned foe as that one bobbled heavily
 inside the seven furlong marker, chased three to four wide advancing to mid pack under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide for home and
 weakened. AWESOME ADVERSARY bumped at the start by GRAY'S IMAGE who broke outwrads, then got bumped by KLICKITAT due to pressure from
 PIER FORTY, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
 HERECOMESTHEJUDGE just off the inside early on, got out three to four wide into the backstretch forcing QUICK CHANGE to alter and COACH VILLA to
 steady in behind that rival, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing in retreat at the
 five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and tired. GRAY'S IMAGE broke outwards hitting the off side stall before bumping AWESOME ADVERSARY at
 the start, then got bumped by that foe due to pressure from PIER FORTY, tracked inside steadying seven furlongs from home as SOUTHERN BRIGADE
 bobbled heavily in front, tipped to the two path half a mile from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

 PRESENCE OF MIND was put to some coaxling keeping an eye on the front runners from the pocket, slipped into the two path at the head of the stretch,
 remained on hold idling behind a developing seam between rivals a short distance up ahead, burst through with confidence once it had grown to full size,
 seized the front end with just under a furlong remaining, kicked clear under a light drive. ALL CLEAR argued for the lead from along the rail, lightly urged by
 the pilot, was called upon settling into upper stretch, got reeled in leaving the eighth pole, continued onward in a willing manner to garner the place. THE
 CHAMO sat reserved in two path for nearly a half, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, proved no match. HOPPER
 DROPPER took up the chase from path three on the bend, commenced the stretch slightly wide, lacked the needed response. BUSS THE BELL never got
 involved off a ground-saving journey. MOSES SUPPOSES in path two, sparred for control to the head of the stretch before giving way.

 Footnotes
 DANIELLE'S PRIDE just off the inside near the rear, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the
 inside for home before tipping out four then five wide with three-sixteenths to go roused, offered up a good finish to close stoutly outside to get up in the last
 jumps and prevail. ALLEY TO CALVARY saved ground near the rear patiently handled until put to light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
 for home, rallied to issue a challenge closing well through the final furlong inside and missed when overtaken in the final jumps by the top one while along
 for the place honors. LAURA'S PATRIOT four then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for
 home rallying to take command straightened away and edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat from flanking challenges
 and was collared by both in the final strides while clear for the show honors. SWEET AUGUST LADY tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from
 the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. TIZ R BELLA three wide in pursuit from near the rear, got
 coaxed along with five-sixteenths to run, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick but was outkicked. CRITIQUE tracked the pace just
 off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. TAYLER'S THE BOSS three then two
 wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, weakened. SOPHIE GERMAIN forwardly placed three to
 four wide down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, issued a bid for command and
 was on near even terms swinging three to four wide for home, then tired through to the finish. MO FLASH established the front shortly after the start and
 showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat,
 yielded the front straightened away and tired. LOVE TO SHARE three to four wide just off the pace, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, went
 five to six wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired. MISS LOYALTY four to five wide near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, backed away
 and went five to six wide for home and was eased.

 Footnotes
 NISHA away well, was in reserve vying as the widest of a threesome for the opening half, settled into upper stretch before switched over to stronger
 handling, emerged at the eighth pole as tne new leader but by now engaged in a spirited tussle with the runner up, dug in gamely to preserve the decision.
 TREBLE rated along in path two with a good view of an ongoing three way spat for the top, swung into action by swiinging to the outside leaving the
 five-sixteenths marker, straightened away in path five and kicked into stride, saw a duel with the winner get ignited by the beginning of the final furlong,
 fought on valiantly but was denied. LUZ MIMI took up the chase from path two on the turn, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths pole, was
 maneuvered into path six from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, finished with good late energy en route for the show. ANGEL AT WAR
 remained along the rail after the field had been sent off and running, was the innermost of a three contending for the top for the opening half, got headed a
 short distance beyond the quarter pole, weakened steadily afterwards. YORKIEPOO PRINCESS set up in the two path after an alert getaway, vied from
 between rivals for the lead to the three-sixteenths pole before giving way. PEACHES AND SPICE cut over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the
 backstretch, failed to menance off the ground-saving journey that followed.

 issue a challenge surging late to just get up in the last jump to the wire. FAST GETAWAY two to three wide just off the pace, got let out swing five wide into
 upper stretch, rallied to take command inside the final sixteenth, dug in under threat and was nailed in the final jump to the finish. CANARSIE KID veered
 out at the start and was corrected, chased three to four wide in aim of the front, swung four wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away,
 inched away briefly before coming under threat, got collared inside the sixteenth pole and held for the show honors. NOT SO QUIET MAN just off the inside
 in mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. SPARKY shied out at the start in
 reaction to CANARSIE KID veering out and in turn bumped SOURCE CONTROL, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six wide
 for home and offered up a mild bid. LEAP TO GLORY forwardly placed along the inside, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the
 inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. EXPEDITER showed the way in hand from the two path, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole,
 spun just off the inside for home, yielded command straightened away and weakened through to the finish. SOURCE CONTROL bumped at the start by
 SPARKY who shied out in reaction to CANARSIE KID, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung seven wide for home and
 weakened. JUPITER RISING chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide at the quarter pole and came up empty.
