 Footnotes
 SILVERDOLLARDREAMS stalked the pace from the four path, bid three wide into the far turn, dueled with another through the latter parts of the turn,
 continued dueling into the lane, began to inch away just outside the eighth pole, brushed with the runner-up nearing the sixteenth pole then cleared late to
 prevail. WOLF MAN ROCKET chased the pace into the backstretch, maintained a close position down the backstretch, bid two wide into the turn, went with
 the winner from mid-turn, dueled with that one to inside the eighth pole, exchanged brushed near the sixteenth pole then could not match strides late while
 finishing far clear of the followers. DUE TO HIS CHARM pressed the pace into the backstretch, gained a short lead entering the far turn, could not keep up
 with the top two in late turn then kept the minor share. OUTSIDE IN was never a factor while saving ground throughout. PROPOSITION JOE led while near
 the inside, was joined by others in late backstretch then dropped out entering the far turn.

 Footnotes
 FATHER BUD was unhurried while along the inside through the turn, cut the corner and shifted from the rail to the three path when going after the leader,
 caught that one nearing the sixteenth pole then edged by late. YOU SEE IT set the pace at once while near the inside, maintained a clear advantage into
 the lane, continued on a clear lead with an eighth to go, was collared by the winner inside the sixteenth pole then gave ground grudgingly. SPY DANCER
 was in the three to four path through the turn and into the lane then ran evenly through the final eighth. DREAM MON chased the pace from the two path
 through the turn, was roused approaching the quarter pole and was empty turning into the lane. PACIENCIA Y FE was never a factor while racing in the two
 path through the turn. EXPRESS CASH chased the pace from the three path into the turn, was roused in mid-turn then had nothing in the lane.

 Footnotes
 LOOKOUT ANGEL chased the pace from the five path into the turn, bid with the leaders four wide in mid-turn, gained the lead near the five-sixteenth pole,
 continued to slowly widen into the lane then was kept to the task to the end to hold. RUNNINWITHUNHEAVEN raced behind a wall of rivals through the
 turn, lacked space along the rail into the lane, shifted into the three path for the drive and slowly gained on the top two gaining the place late and diminishing
 the winner's advantage. EASY DEAR pressed the pace while along the inside into the turn, chased the leader into the lane then could not make significant
 headway into the disadvantage and lost the place spot on the final stride. DARLENE'S DELIGHT was along the inside through the turn, came into the lane
 from the three path, looked for room in mid-track, settled back into the three path and gained belatedly. RED SAILS FLYING pressed the pace three wide
 into the turn, settled back to chase the leaders into the lane then was empty. CHECKTHESALT was near the inside early in the turn, came off the inside in
 late turn, angled widest into the lane and never factored. CABBY JOSHTIN vied for the early lead while three wide into the turn, continued to be hard ridden
 in mid-turn the faded.

 Footnotes
 PHAT CAT stalked the pace while three wide into the far turn, bid in mid-turn, dueled into the lane, cleared before the quarter pole, looked to be a winner in
 deep stretch then was all out to just last. MAXIMUS DAN was steadied entering the first turn when rival came out, raced unhurried while along the inside,
 bid into the lane from off the inside and was closing in to just miss. LIL PISTOLA set the pace from between rivals into the far turn, continued in close
 proximity into the lane then weakened in deep stretch. MONKEYWITMYBIDNESS pressed the pace while along the inside into the far turn, chased the
 leaders into the lane and lacked a response while weakening the final eighth. MANDALORIAN was in the four path through the turns, came into the lane
 from the six path and was never a serious menace. COOL HAND KUTZ chased the pace from the four then the three path through the turn and tired
 entering the lane. VREELAND was in the seven to the four path through the first turn, moved up to be a contender into the far turn while in the three path
 and was done entering the lane. THIRTEEN ROSES was steadied on the heels of a rival through the first turn when strongly pulling, continued eager into
 the backstretch and was finished entering the far turn. CASH COWBOY was in the eight to the five path through the first turn, was still well off the inside into
 the far turn when finished. DUKE OF DON dropped to the back into the backstretch, continued to drop back into the lane and was eased to the wire and
 subsequently walked off.
