 a furlong out but slackened late. HONG KONG FLEW flashed speed from the rail and came up empty. KISS STEALIN outrun.

 Footnotes
 QUEEN OF TEQUILA was permitted to settle early from off the rail, moved closer inside to the second turn, split the leaders nearing the stretch to get to
 terms, dueled to the wire and just held. EXACTAMENTE pressed the pace two wide, forged to the front in the stretch, lost the lead in the deep stretch but
 battled back and just missed. MOSCATO GIRL set the pace from the inside, remained a factor when headed into the lane then gave way at mid stretch.
 PERFECTLY SEASONED lagged early, tried to rally five wide on the second turn but had no response. WARRENS GOLDNUGGET settled two wide,
 moved out to the four path on the second turn and came up empty. WICKED OLD FASHION refused to break from the gate and following a stewards inquiry
 was declared a starter.

 Footnotes
 SUSIE SUNSHINE was in front shortly after the start, set all the pace two wide to the stretch then responded in the drive and held. MISS SHIRLEY C was
 chasing the winner three wide to the stretch, tried to make an impact in the drive but could not catch up while holding second. BARBELLO (NZ) had no
 speed, was caught out four deep on the turn and lacked the needed late response. CITY BELLE was inside of BARBELLO (NZ) three wide to the stretch
 and also finished evenly. MEET'N ON HIGH pressed the winner from the rail to the stretch but weakened in the drive.

 SPECIAL SEASON (GB) was unhurried to the second turn, rallied four wide to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch and edged away driving.
 BURGER AND FRIES (FR) was fanned out six then five wide to the backstretch, chased to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch, bid to loom a
 threat to mid stretch but was no match for the winner. FOREVER THE CHIEF was five wide early, settled to the half, saved ground on the second turn, was
 rallying then had to check off of CAPES HOT ROCKET'S heels in mid stretch and finished evenly. CAPES HOT ROCKET had the best speed while three
 wide to the backstretch, pushed away to the second turn, responded to the stretch but was tiring through the drive. SOJOURN was forced out to the seven
 path into the first turn, settled on the backstretch, was roused five wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. AT EASE was settled early while two
 wide to the backstretch, saved ground on the second turn but had little to offer in the drive. NIGHT'S WATCH chased the pace four then three wide to the
 second turn but gave out after six furlongs.

 SIR VRONSKI broke clean and was on the pace to the half mile pole, inched way two wide then pushed clear to mid stretch and was under steady urging to
 the line. AWHITESPORTSCOAT dueled outside the winner to the turn, was outkicked while three wide to the stretch then could not threaten the winner but
 dug in late to hold second. AWESOME ANYWHERE chased the leaders three wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. TOP
 PIRANA got outsprinted to the turn, circled five wide to the stretch but went evenly through the drive. KARMA KING broke a bit slow and trailed to the turn
 remained last while four wide to the stretch then picked off rivals in a mild bid. LIL' CHIEFTAIN got outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch but
 never threatened. HEKILI STORM stalked the pace early, was four wide on the turn but weakened through the stretch. PURE COMEDY was chasing to the

 ACRIMONIOUS was on the pace from the outset, dueled two wide to the stretch then responded when set down and pushed clear driving. KONA BREEZE
 chased the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, did not threaten the winner but finished steadily for second. EL NINO FABLE was outrun to
 the turn, came three then four wide to the stretch and picked off rivals through the drive. PEPPERINO contested the pace outside the winner and three wide
 to the stretch then was being outrun to mid stretch and raced erratically. MON CAMO was bumped and jostled between rivals shortly after the start then
 saved ground to no avail. GOLD AND GUNS bumped with MON CAMO to begin, had to check off heels nearing the half mile pole, was three wide on the
 turn and came up empty in the drive. SOUL OBSESSION hopped shortly after the start and lost any chance. SCENE ENUF had brief speed only and
 stopped in the stretch.
