 FEDERAL DOMINANCE stalked two wide, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled with SENSATIONAL ZIP entering the stretch, dug ingamely outside of that
 rival and edged away late after a long drive. BLUE SKIES FOREVER raced off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the far turn, rallied between rivals
 in deep stretch and got the nod for second. CUTTER HELM raced four wide early, then stalked three wide, continued three wide on the far turn, rallied
 mildly outside and got the nod for third in a blanket finish for the minor awards. REDNECK COWBOY raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far
 turn, closed late in the two path and missed for third. SENSATIONAL ZIP set the pace, dueled on the far turn, dug in along the inside in the stretch, then
 jumped tire tracks at the seventy yards pole and weakened. BEARING SECRETS raced four wide early, then three wide and lacked a rally. BLURRED LINE
 tracked along the inside, then two wide, was asked on the far turn and failed to respond. SOUTHERN CAL raced three wide early and was outrun.

 MASQUE D'OISEAU away alertly to set the pace, jumped at the three eighths marker, maintained a clear lead, responded when asked and finished willingly
 under some urging. REAL DOOZIE chased the winner from the outset, finished well but clearly second best. UPLIFTED was off slowly, raced off the pace,
 moved up inside on the turn and rallied inside for third. GET DIRECTIONS was off slowly and bumped, raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the
 lane and lacked a rally. FOXY'S EDGE raced off the pace outside a rival, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. MISTY TASTE was off slowly and bumped,
 raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. WARRIOR'S BLADE raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
