 Footnotes
 TIZ DE LOVELY tracked the early pace three and four wid to bid into the far turn, continued outside MISS REVEILLE to the top of the lane and edged clear
 late. MISS REVEILLE contested the pace three wide, continued inside the winner through the far turn into the lane and could not match strides late.
 DANICA TO was on the early pace racing about the two path and weakened nearing the lane. SHE'S A FANTASY saved ground through the first turn,
 angled out in the far turn to move four wide into the lane and could not threaten. BELLA DANCERELLA was just off the early pace along the inside and
 weakened. FLEW DA COOP was not a factor racing three wide. REGAL HEIRESS attempted to refuse to break and did not leave the gate until the field had
 traveled well over a sixteenth of mile then completed the course far back.

 Footnotes
 WITT'S STRIKE was on the pace from about the two path inside DARLING GIRL, put that one away and then shook off a bid through the far turn and edged
 clear late under steady handling. SEEKING PENNY stalked the pace from three wide to bid outside the winner through the far turn then could not match
 strides late. LAINE'S PEACH stalked the pace from along the inside, angled out once straightened into the lane but lacked a solid final closing run.
 JOLYNNSDUBLOHSEVEN lacked a rally racing three and four wide. OCTOBER WON was not a factor. DARLING GIRL prompted the early pace outside
 the winner to the far turn and tired.

 Footnotes
 IMA DANGER was just behind the dueling leaders outside to rally five and six wide through the turn into the lane, wore down TAYLOR'S BEAUTY through
 the final sixteenth and was up late. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY dueled inside rivals to edge clear nearing the lane then could not contain the winner's late run.
 POINT AND FIRE was along the inside to move up through the turn then continued to close but was too late. HOLIDAY CLOVER dueled four and five wide
 on the lead early then was outfinished for position in the lane. MY LADY J was just behind the dueling leaders about the two path and lacked the needed
 late rally. AIRIETTE dueled from between rivals early and weakened in the drive. MUZZ'EM was caught in tight between rivals early in the turn and steadied
 then dropped back.

 BETA CAPO SONG hooked up outside BRONCO DAVE shortly after the break to duel that one throughout, continued strongly in the lane and was slowly
 edging clear late. BRONCO DAVE dueled from inside the winner from early on and held well through the lane. FREE MUSIC tracked the top pair from three
 wide and could not close the gap in the drive. WELL MANNERED moved up three wide but could not threaten the top ones in the lane. MYSTIC WOOD
 FORCE came out to bump with a rival at the start then lacked a rally racing four wide. WHOLELOTTA BUMPER was along the inside and weakened
 through the turn. LOOK AT IT saved ground and was not a factor. PRIVATE STASH leaned into the side of the gate then bumped with a rival at the start
 and was always back while four to five wide.

 CHILANGO dueled on the early lead inside ROCKETRINGO while about the two path, shook off that rival in the final turn to kick well clear then held safe
 under steady handling in the lane. BIG HEARTED FACTOR settled off the pace racing three wide, angled inside going to the far turn and rallied to slowly
 close on the winner late. FOOLISH PRINCE saved ground to move up through the far turn and continued with a mild late rally to gain the show. PICADILLY
 ROADSTER saved ground to the far turn, angled out nearing the lane to be five wide turning for home and could not hold position. BORN FORCE lagged
 well back off the early pace racing four wide and moved up from seven wide into the lane while not a threat late. SUPER CHARLIE followed the pace
 outside and weakened from four and five wide through the far turn. MAJOR LEAGUE was back racing four to five wide then fanned eight wide into the lane.
 ROCKETRINGO dueled outside the winner through the opening half mile and tired in the far turn.

 A BUNCH FOR LUNCH stalked the pace from along the inside, rallied inside the leaders through the lane and moved clear under steady handling. ONE
 HOTDISH moved to a clear lead racing about the two or three path, made the running to upper stretch and could not go with the winner late.
 IWANNATALKABOUTME stalked the pace in good position four wide, bid through the far turn and could not sustain the rally in the lane. PUT SARAH ON
 saved ground in reach of the pace and lacked a final closing bid. STALKER dropped back off the pace racing three wide, moved five wide in the far turn and
 improved position. CODYS CUPCAKE was not a factor. CITY ROMANCE chased the early pace from three wide and tired. ICE BOX RAIDER followed the
 pace four wide, pulled up in the far turn and was vanned off.
