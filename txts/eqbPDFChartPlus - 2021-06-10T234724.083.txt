 Footnotes
 WHATEVERYOUSAYBABY accelerated to contention toward the outside, took aim in the three path nearing the quarter pole then dug in through the lane to
 get up the final yards. PRINCESS DONNA drew clear and angled toward the inside to set a pressured pace, dug in with the advantage to deep stretch but
 was caught the final yards. LINEA VERDE chased the early pace about the three path, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened stride the final sixteenth.
 COME TO UTOPIA chased the pace off the rail, rounded the turn in the three path and finished evenly. SAWGRASS chased the pace inside, rounded the
 turn in the three path though had little left down the lane. BLAZIN' FURY stumbled to her nose leaving the gate then angled to the outside to give chase,
 rounded the turn in the five path but had little left through the lane. SCARE CASTLE chased the early pace toward mid track then saved some ground on the
 turn.

 Footnotes
 LIGHTNING BUZZ stalked the early pace in the two and three paths, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, closed the gap five wide on the far turn
 then dug in through the lane to put a head in front the final yards. CROSSING BORDERS raced with the early pace two deep then took the lead nearing the
 five sixteenths pole, contested the advantage in the three path of the far turn, dug in through the lane to hold on to deep stretch then reluctantly ceded the
 final yards. STARRY MESSENGER settled off the pace inside, bid into the far turn and raced at the rail most of the turn, eased slightly out entering the
 stretch and finished evenly in show. FLIPPED saved ground off the early pace then settled toward mid track into the backstretch, bid nearing the three
 eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and raced evenly down the lane. Used hard to set the pace at mostly even terms, GINGERS HERO ceded
 the edge to Crossing Borders at the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail rounding the far turn but dropped back into the
 lane and weakened the final sixteenth. KINGDOM MINDED showed little response through the backstretch while mostly saving ground. UNSPOKEN
 QUALITY was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 DONNA'S DELIGHT rated a short lead inside, was met at even terms and briefly gave up the advantage approaching the three eighths pole, but, quickly
 recovered control to widen past the five sixteenths then held on under steady stretch encouragement. FINGERPAINT stalked the pace three and four wide,
 bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep, dueled for second in the upper stretch and was gaining on the winner through later
 yards. BELLE NATION settled off the pace toward the inside, bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled three wide then drifted a bit
 leaving the far turn and got up for third in the final yards. WITH WINGS stalked the pace two deep, drew to even terms and took a slim brief lead at the three
 eighths pole, gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride the final sixteenth. After scrambling from the gate, JAZZIE JO
 dropped well back and saved ground, eased out with a bid into the backstretch, but it turned out to be only a mild middle move. CHERCHAZ LA FEMME
 stalked the pace from the four and five paths, showed little response down the backstretch then faded nearing the far turn. DEPUTY JOLIE raced off the
 pace and off the rail then faded after a half mile. MAJOR CRISIS settled in the back in the three and four paths and was not a factor.

 Footnotes
 A bit reluctant to load, SAGEBRUSH angled in while giving close chase through the backstretch, contested even terms two deep rounding the turn, took the
 lead past the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on under steady encouragement. PURGATORY chased the pace from the outside, rounded the
 turn in the four and five path then dug in from the head of the lane and dueled for second while gaining mildly on the winner. FIREBIRD chased the pace
 inside, rounded the turn at the rail, angled out entering the stretch, was outfinished in the stretch duel for second but just up for third. MELTECH set a
 pressured pace inside, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the turn, gave up the advantage leaving the eighth pole but continued a factor to
 mid-stretch before beginning to flatten stride. KATYS MIRACLE chased the pace toward mid track, rounded the turn in the four and five paths, steadied in
 the upper stretch then finished evenly. MR. MARVIN chased the leaders from the inside, rounded the turn at the rail and raced evenly down the lane.
 STERLING CAESAR gave chase from the three path then faded rounding the turn. ASK ME NOT was slow getting into stride and consequently, trailed
 early. AGAINSTREGULATIONS chased the early pace toward the outside then rounded the turn about the four path.

 Footnotes
 DUKIN' WITH DALE angled to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, widened at the rail approaching the top of the lane
 and held on well under steady handling. MODERN MEDICINE was bumped off stride into the first turn and raced in the five path through the turn, started a
 bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn five wide then dueled the length of the stretch for second. GOODBYESEEULATER became edgy
 in the gate and was jostled between horses into the first turn, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, loomed a close factor in the four path most of the far
 turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. NORTHERN FREEWAY saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far
 turn at the rail and raced evenly down the lane. RELENTLESS STRIKE raced off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn and settled outside
 into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five and six paths then flattened stride later yards. JUST BY CHANCE
 angled in through the front stretch to stalk the pace two deep, challenged between horses at the three eighths pole and continued a close factor to the mid
 point of the far turn before beginning to weaken. POINT OF VISION settled back in the three path, showed little response through the backstretch and
 rounded the far turn in the four path. MACANAO settled back off the rail and was not a factor. PURIM'S GOLD saved ground. LENNY drifted making contact
 with Goodbyeseeulater into the first turn, settled off the pace entering the backstretch and showed little response.

 Footnotes
 TURNER ASHBY was hustled along through the front stretch and rated a short lead inside past the five eighths pole, came under pressure toward the three
 eighths, drifted leaving the far turn but dug in under all out encouragement and just lasted. BLIMEY LIMEY rated close about the three path, bid nearing the
 three eighths pole, dueled a close factor four wide on the far turn, steadily closed for second in the final yards and just missed the win. SWISS SUNRISE
 rated close off the rail, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage in the three path of the far turn, angled inside the errant
 Turner Ashby past the eighth pole and dug in gamely to the finish. CHARITABLE VISIT saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
 rounded the far turn at the rail, loomed a close factor through the upper stretch and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. SUAVE JUAN came
 away a step slow and raced well off the early pace, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and passed
 rivals down the lane. WHAT A STORY raced well off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
 THORN OF ROSE HILL raced well back and was not a factor. FLASHY READY RICK raced off the pace in the four and five paths, settled outside into the
 backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. BLACK STEEL rounded the opening turn in the five
 path and settled close into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded rounding the far turn. LUC D'VERMONT rounded the opening
 turn in the four and five paths and showed little response through the backstretch.

 Footnotes
 After unseating her rider and running loose in the post parade, DEREK'S COP E CAT quickly took the lead and rated the pace inside, pulled herself clear
 past the three eighths pole, was urged away at the rail rounding the far turn and proved much the best under steady insistence. Reluctant to load,
 CHARITABLE TIME raced well off the pace in the five and six paths the opening turn, raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
 pole, circled rivals five wide on the far turn and dueled for second in the upper stretch while no match for the winner. RAPID RABBIT settled well off the
 pace two deep the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled out entering the stretch and left the turn five wide then finished evenly.
 GIFTOFGRACE settled off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn, started a bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the three path
 and finished evenly. WIND AND STORM raced off the pace in the three path, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened stride down the
 lane. SOMETHING SWEET saved ground off the pace, steadied nearing the quarter pole and passed some rivals in the lane. CHARITABLE MISS was not
 a factor. CAROL stalked the pace two deep and took a brief lead between poles, gave chase from the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail rounding
 the far turn. DENISE OF CORK saved ground racing well off the pace, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened. ALLEGHENY MACGRAW came away
 awkwardly and rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole then faded through the far turn.
