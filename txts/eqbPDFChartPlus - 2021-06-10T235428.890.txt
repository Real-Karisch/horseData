 SCAT LADY good speed to set pace, hard used in the stretch run and lasted to the wire in a good effort. LOOKIN AT GRACE had an awkward star with, no
 speed to far turn, circled field widest in the stretch and was gaining on the winner too late. EYE ON THE MONEY raced three wide to far turn with no late
 response in the drive. ENOTIONAL LOVE unhurried to far turn, finished well between horses while too late. NATIVE forward factor three quarters with no
 late gain in the stretch run. REGAL HEIRESS never a factor. PROMISE ME SNOW close for a half, appeared to go wrong at the far turn and galloped past
 the wire.

 Footnotes
 BODLER set a solid pace to the stretch, hooked in a ding dong battle which found him a head short in deep stretch but battled back to prevail in a gallant
 effort to the wire. DUSTY well placed to turn, hooked the winner to gain a short lead inside the furlong marker but was outfinished to the wire. NO PHONE
 JOE raced evenly but lacked the late response in the drive when called upon. M DEE raced five or six wide past the quarter pole with no gain in the final
 furlong. ILLUSION'S RULE pressed winner to turn but faded thereafter in the stretch run. IN A WHILE never a factor. WHEN TH CATS AWAY was through
 early and dropped back.

 CONUMDRUM RED taken in hand confidently, ran three wide around the turn and into the stretch on the wrong lead and still proved an easy winner.
 STORMED OFF had a terrible start, rallied wide into stretch for the place spot while no match for the winner. CONJURING chased leader to turn, could not
 keep up in the stretch. MYSTIC BRIDGE brief speed to turn, could not keep up, dropped back. IN PEGGY'S CASE never a menace.

 angled out late stretch to be gaining on the winner too late. COME ON BERT well placed, never far back, mild bid through the stretch run but flattened out in
 the drive. HAVEONEFORDROAD chased winner to the turn but weakened in the lane. PI SAIL was through after a half. ULTIMATE CHOICE was through
 after a half also. EMRAAN never a menace. OLDFASHION JUSTICE was through early but backed up quickly.
