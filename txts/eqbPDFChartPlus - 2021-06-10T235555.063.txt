 TWO BEARS was the quickest, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded to draw clear driving. GOTHIC GIRL chased the winner from the rail
 to the stretch then outbattled TOTALLY UPBEAT for second without menacing the winner. TOTALLY UPBEAT stalked to the turn, pressed the winner two
 wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. SPUN TIGER broke slow, lagged two wide to the stretch and was never a factor. ROYAL
 ALEXIS stalked the pace to the turn, was three wide then drifted out four deep into the stretch and gave out in mid stretch.
