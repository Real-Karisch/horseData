 Footnotes
 SUPER BOBBIE was rated inside a rival tracking the leader from just out of striking distance in the opening half, came through inside the pacesetter to
 challenge for command when presented an opening racing into the far turn, quickly moved clear and widened the advantage under pressure. WESTERN
 ATTIRE tracked the pacesetter under light reserve racing just outside the eventual winner in the opening stages, was forced to shifted out three wide on the
 far turn while being prompted to advance in tandem with that rival, lost contact with the winner racing into upper stretch, but angled inside a rival while
 continuing with interest to secure the place honors late. RENEGADE RUNNER was hustled clear along the inside, set the pace to the far turn, drifted out
 entering the second bend and quickly gave way. KATHLEEN V. ducked out at the start, settled last and never menaced thereafter. PRIOR TO THE RACE
 ZIMM'S LEMON DROP AND JUBILANCE EACH LOST THEIR RIDERS, THEN RAN LOOSE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, NECESSITATING THEIR
 RESPECTIVE LATE SCRATCHES. ALSO PRIOR TO THE RACE WICKED CONNECTION WAS ORDERED SCRATCHED ON ADVICE OF THE TRACK
 VETERINARIAN.

 Footnotes
 WHY FRANK, held up avoiding some close quarters while angling to the inside in the opening stages, tracked off the second flight under light reserve to the
 far turn, switched out racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance between foes and wrested the advantage late under firm left handed
 encouragement. BEST OF THE BLEU'S angled inwards in the opening stages to track off the second flight between foes under light reserve in the opening
 half, shifted out nearing upper stretch to bid four wide midstretch and continued with interest while just outkicked by the winner. THE BULL (AUS), forwardly
 placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, switched out entering the backstretch to press the issue between rivals into the
 far turn, gained the advantage in upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum. TWO CHANCE tracked off the second flight four wide in the opening
 stages, angled five wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance and made some progress while outkicked by the top trio. SLIP AND
 DRIVE worked his way to the inside racing to the backstretch tracking well off the leaders in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn, then shifted out
 in upper stretch to make some belated progress between foes just off the inside late. ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY, forwardly placed three wide between foes in
 the second flight, lodged a brief bid between foes on the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. HOLY FRAZIER settled near the inside early and
 failed to menace. RAGGED EDGE broke slowly and never gained contention. MAMBOCELLO, caught three, then four wide racing to the backstretch
 tracking off the second flight, faded from contention early. YES BY GOLD stumbled at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to the lead along the inside
 racing to the first turn, dueled for command through the backstretch into the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. CHRISTMAS CABALLO proved
 no factor. YA ANTABTTSY trailed throughout.

 Footnotes
 AMY'S CHALLENGE bobbled slightly just after the start but readily moved to terms with a rival on the pace prompting that foe while angling inwards through
 the backstretch, steadily asserted herself nearing upper stretch to force the issue, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear late
 under mild urging and a right handed tap. HONEY'S SOX APPEAL tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight racing into the bend, shifted out three
 wide racing through the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. FAIRWAYNGREEN was urged to the lead from between foes in the opening
 stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the bend, briefly disputed the issue nearing upper stretch but proved no match in
 late stages, weakening to lose the place honors nearing the wire. THOUGHTLESS tracked the leaders four wide, then three deep as part of the second
 flight racing through the turn to upper stretch but lacked a closing response. ENCHANTING EMBRACE tracked the leaders three deep, then between foes
 in second flight racing into the turn and faded midstretch. SHAR RAN briefly tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, was eased back from that
 position early and proved no threat thereafter.

 AWESOME EMMIT, in touch with a rival attending the pace on his own courage in the opening stages, pressed the issue racing into upper stretch and
 edged clear late under firm handling. LONDON LEGACY, urged to dictate terms on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, dueled for
 command inside the winner into upper stretch but proved no match for that rival late. ENDER settled last early along the inside, was prompted to advance
 along the rail into upper stretch to challenge inside the top pair but had no late kick. EXEMPLAR, caught five wide between foes in second flight early, was
 fanned five wide racing into upper stretch but continued with an effort to gain some position. SO SORRY RUSTON, caught four wide between foes in the
 opening stages, was eased back while angling inwards early but lacked a rally. GO GOLD, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders, faded
 after a half. MADELYN'S WILD MAX, caught six wide in the opening quarter, dropped out racing into the turn and angled inside while failing to menace
 thereafter.

 Footnotes
 PICADILLY ROADSTER was away alertly from the outside, tracked the pace three wide along the backstretch, moved forward to wrest command from
 LAND OF OZ at the three eighths pole, maintained a comfortable margin under steady right handed urging in the upper stretch and held sway late.
 KICKENIT tracked the pace on the inside through the opening half, angled out on the far turn to gain position, but failed to match strides with PICADILLY
 ROADSTER and was outkicked in the stretch. OUTRAGEOUS GREEN showed brief early speed between foes along the backstretch, lost ground backing
 up to near the rear of the field, came back again to pass tiring rivals in the lane to get up for show on the inside under steady right handed pressure. THE
 LAST PROPHET hopped slightly at the break, trailed in the early going, gained position on the far turn, caught in tight nearing the three sixteenths pole
 while trying to split rivals and came on mildly in the lane. DR. SHIPLEY settled well back on the outside, swung out four wide on the far turn while gaining
 ground, but flattened out in the lane. LAND OF OZ set the pace on the inside and faded in the lane. BRUNTINO showed brief foot three wide along the
 backstretch and faded in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 BEACH FLOWER tracked just off the early pacesetter, wrested command from FIGHT TO GLORY while angling out at the three sixteenths pole and drove
 clear through the stretch under steady right handed pressure. FIGHT TO GLORY was sent to the lead out of the gate, opened up a clear lead along the
 backstretch, ceded lead to BEACH FLOWER at the top of the lane and was clearly second best. PINUP GIRL was allowed to settle on the inside in the early
 going, saved ground to the three eighths pole then shifted out four wide on the far turn and got up late for show. EASE IT ON OVER settled off the pace on
 the inside and failed to menace. DIVA'S RULE settled between foes in the early going, shifted three wide far turn, and faded. PANOE tracked off the pace
 early, hustled up three wide along the backstretch, and gave way on the far turn.

 Footnotes
 NO MO ITCH was away alertly, set the early pace, challenged by GUS'S TIZZY nearing the quarter pole but denied that rival and prevailed under steady
 right handed pressure in the lane. GUS'S TIZZY broke out bumped foe at the start, tracked the pacesetter throughout, headed rival at the quarter pole,
 steadied slightly at the top of the lane and was second best. VIX VISION broke in at the break bumping rival, tracked well back of the pacesetters four wide
 along the backstretch, and made a mild bid in deep stretch to get up for show. KAUFY BUZZ trailed in the early going and passed tiring rivals in the lane.
 SAVAGE WARRIOR was bumped by VIX VISION then subsequently by GUS'S TIZZY shortly after the break, chased between foes and proved no factor
 late. JUST MO showed brief foot three wide, eased at the top of the lane and walked off under his own power.
