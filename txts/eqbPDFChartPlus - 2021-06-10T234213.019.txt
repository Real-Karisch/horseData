 Footnotes
 LADY FATIMA along the outside throughout, steadily advaced towards the front runners from path two on the turn, was under encouragement swinging
 approximately four wide into the stretch, maintained the momentum displayed on the bend and chipped away at the defict, closed in more readily with her
 long strides beginning from around the sixteenth pole, overhauled KIAWAH SUNSET in the shadow of the finish line to get the job done. KIAWAH SUNSET
 temporarily dropped back after stumbling after the break, got going back in short order and rushed up into a forward position, coaxed by the pilot, was just
 off the left rim of the two path loosely drafting behind the pacesetter, tipped into a firmer fit in the two path stepping onto the head of the stretch, forged to
 the front with slightly under a furlong to go, felt the presence of the winner late and got nailed. MORALITY CLAUSE stutter-stepped her way out of the
 starting gate, then saw the rider take hold and shift to the right after KIAWAH SUNSET stumbled, cut over to the rail, getting there by the half mile pole,
 picked up interest a furlong down the road, angled five wide, becoming the widest of all, into the stretch, rallied with good energy to secure the show. DAYS
 OF SPRING took up the chase third lin line towards the inside travelling on the turn, came under a ride approaching the five-sixteentsh marker, went three
 wide into the lane, mustered up a mild response. SEAYOUATHEBREAKERS retained the advantage after out-breaking the compeition, was set up at a
 slight distance from off the rail, carved out the pace, lightly hand urged and on a loosely-contested lead, got roused when confronted by the second place
 finisher at the furlong grounds, relinquished a short time later and weakened. MAIN SQUEEZE strung out three to four wide on the turn, strolled into the
 stretch, firmly held, then was permitted to fade away.

 Footnotes
 QUEEN KAHEN angled sharply into the three path coming up to the half mile pole, was lightly hand urged taking up the chase on the turn, commenced the
 stretch slightly wider, responded when set down, forging to a small advantage by the beginning of the last eighth, edged away, kept to the task at hand until
 the last forty yards. G. T. SONIA stalked the pace two to three wide, firmly rated during the early stages of that pursuit, went five wide into the stretch,
 straightened away, proved no match but had enough of a kick to secure second. IT'S A SHAW THING sat forwardly placed three wide, was in the same
 path swinging into the stretch, put in her bid from the top of the lane until the sixteenth pole before backing away. FORBIDDEN FROLIC grabbed command
 shortly after the field had been sent off and running, was coaxed along showing the way from path two, got switched over to stronger handling when
 challenged at the three-sixteenths pole, yielded and faltered. BIZNESS BEAUTY quickly guided over to the rail, was maneuvered into path six from upper to
 midlane, made no impact. KNOW POINT GIVEN three wide onto the turn, was put to encouragement by the midway point, was moved five wide into the
 stretch and gave way. ADHAFERA shied in a bit and away from IT'S A SHOW THING at the start, underwent a two wide journey on the turn, inched over to
 the rail in time to cut the corner into the lane, had no offering.

 After a twelve minute delay due to a passing severe thunderstorm, UNLEVERAGED three to four wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to apply
 pressure midway down the backstretch as IL PRIMO SOLE ranged up outside, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper
 stretch, dug in under a drive reeling in the leader just inside the sixteenth marker under threat from the runner up to the outside and prevailed on the wire.
 HOBOE settled two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear, tipped out five wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued
 five wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge through the final furlong latching on the aforementioned foe inside the final sixteenth to be up
 for the place honors under the wire. KING CAUSE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through moderate splits coming
 under pressure from a pair five furlongs from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away
 under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was caught inside the final sixteenth. FINANCIAL SYSTEM broke out at the start bumping MINTZ, chased two to
 three wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide for home, offered up a mild bid to the furlong grounds,
 flattened out in the late stages. LEAVEEMATTHEGATE three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing half a mile from home, angled five
 wide into upper stretch, offered no response. VINCENTO broke in at the start and was corrected, chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile
 pole, bid nearing the quarter pole and cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the final eighth. IL PRIMO SOLE (GB) four to five wide in pursuit,
 advanced to apply pressure midway down the backstretch, came under coaxing four wide at the three-eighths, continued four wide for home in retreat and
 tired. MINTZ bumped at the start by FINANCIAL SYSTEM who broke outwards, chased three then two wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just
 off the inside for home and was eased in the in final furlong. YAMANO MAKER (JPN) lunged at the break getting away last, chased five wide under a ride
 from three furlongs out, went five to six wide for home and was eased in the stretch.

 Footnotes
 BRONXVILLE away in good order, established control in short order, was moved into the two path, got rated along showing the way on an open lead, spun
 into the lane still comfortably in the clear, was deep into the furlong grounds before getting called upon for more, gave the desired response and kicked
 away. ZIPMAN two to three wide stalking the winner, got put to a drive spinning approximately four wide into the stretch, proved no match. COOLBOY took
 path three in pursuit of the front runners, was under a drive spinning five wide into the lane, stayed on late to secure the show. INDIGESTION brushed at the
 start, departed the backstretch between rivals in the two path, swung five wide onto the head of the stretch and gave way. GRASSETTO remained along the
 inside route after the start, and would be the only member to spend significant time along it, was put to a brisk hand ride nearing the conclusion of the
 backstretch, came under the whip only a furlong down the road, tipped into path two entering the stretch and backed away. INTO THE BREACH made light
 contact with INDIGESTION in the shadow of the starting gvate, raced two wide on the turn, shifted into path six from upper to midlane, lacked the needed
 response. NO NO NOAH saw the pilot bounce in the saddle after taking an awkward initial step, was hung out four wide, the widest of all, during the run
 around the bend, stepped off the turn one path farher off the rail, faded away then was reported after the race to have bled.

 home, took over straightened away, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. WILLING TO SPEED three to four wide in
 pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide for home, offered up a mild kick to procure the place honors.

 Footnotes
 DYNA PASSER reserved in the two path, got eased to the outside at the five-sixteenths marker, slithered her way into path four after going another furlong,
 kicked into her best when given her cue, emerging at the eighth pole as the new leader, dug in with determination to preserve the decision. DECORATING
 in range taking the two path, swung into action by swinging five wide into the stretch, narrowed in on the one to catch, came up short while finishing in a tie
 for the place. BEAU BELLE forwardly placed three wide, got driven into the lane, failed to cut in the deficit in the last eighth, but had enough energy left
 nevertheless to end up on even terms with DECORATING for second. MONHEGAN pocketed to the quarter pole, was hand urged tipping into the two path
 for entrance into the lane, came up empty. MORELIKELYTHANNOT mostly three wide to the end of the second bend, got sent out into path from upper to
 midlane, mustered up a mild response. ANOTHER DAY OF SUN quickly placed along the rail, took it to the quarter pole, was under a drive manevuering
 towards path four during the stretch run, made no headway late. TEAM WIN prompted the pace from the two path, challenged in earnest spinning onto the
 head of the stretch, wasn't up to it and weakened. MIDNIGHT PARTY was gathered after breaking slightly to the outside, proceeded along in a sluggish
 manner until crossing the finish line for the first turn, tucked into path two, sat back there teamed up with the rail-riding ANOTHER DAY OF SUN, shifted into
 path five during the initial portion of the stretch, made no impact. TO A FRIEND broke well and established the top, moved over to the rail, got rated cutting
 the pace, under the watchful eye of TEAM WIN to the outside, was set down stepping into the lane, with the pressure having intensified quite a bit, got
 overhauled soon afterwards and faltered. INSPECTOR HAVERS travelled three wide on each bend, wandered out towards path for entrance into the stretch
 appearing to have little left, retreated into last.

 Footnotes
 YOU TELL ME forwardly three wide during the opening phases, poked a head down in front as the half was being completed, shifted one path closer to the
 rail, was kept in reserve leading the others during the run around the bend, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker before getting asked for more,
 offered up enough of a response to leave the eighth pole in possesion of its largest advantage, saw its stablemate bearing down hard to the outside late, but
 reached the wire in time. CAUSE I'M ALEX saved ground for over three-quarters, was put to a ride maneuvering into path five from upper to midstretch,
 charged at the winner with belated energy, missed. TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK off the inside throughout, underwent a three wide on the turn, commenced
 the stretch slighlty wider, ducked in from some right side pressure between the furlong marker and the sixteenth pole, flattened out late. THE CROCHERON
 KID used along the chute to establish the front end, vied towards the inside matched up with the top one, saw that opponent narrowly take over approaching
 the conclusion of the backstretch, hung around as a forward factor for six furlongs then readily backed away. SAMADI SKY strung out four wide on the turn,
 gave way. FRANCIS FREUD an early pace factor from path two, began to back away coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, drifted nine wide into the lane
 then was allowed to fade away having been placed to a protective hold.
