 Footnotes
 ASTRO RIDER contested the pace through the front stretch then rated on the lead into the first turn, was pressured from the five sixteenths pole and held
 well under steady encouragement. HOORAY HENRY saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved for second past
 the quarter pole then flattened stride the final sixteenth. RELENTLESS LION hesitated then lunged from the gate and raced well back off the rail the first
 turn, eased to the outside into the backstretch, bid from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled to the three path leaving the far turn,
 came inside the runner-up mid-stretch and was gaining on that one. BLIMEY LIMEY rounded the opening turn in the three path and raced well off the pace
 leaving the turn, bid past the half mile pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and showed little more. RUN BANNER came in at the break and raced with
 the pace through the front stretch then stalked the winner into the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn. FORBIDDEN
 TOPIC raced well back and was not a factor. HYPERLAPSE (IRE) settled off the early pace inside but was through after three eighths. A stewards inquiry
 and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Run Banner, lodged by the rider of Forbidden Topic, resulted in the disqualification of the former to six
 place for coming in across the path of the latter leaving the gate.

 Footnotes
 ELLIE BEAR raced two deep the first turn, closed to the lead at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, dug in under steady encouragement
 through the lane and just lasted. SAILING ROCK stalked the pace two deep, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, dug
 in from the top of the lane and just missed in a strong finish. CHARITABLE ROSE raced in the four path both turns, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole
 and finished evenly. GOT ANY QUESTIONS raced boxed at the rail the first turn, started a bid leaving the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and
 showed little further. BLAME JULIE set the pace inside, was pressured nearing the seven sixteenths pole, yielded the advantage at the three eighths pole
 and gave chase from there, then faded at the rail rounding the far turn. LIME JUICE settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven
 sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed little more. STARBOARD was never a factor. SO RED THE ROSE raced five wide the first
 turn and showed only mild response through the backstretch. WINDSOR'S WISH was kept in check early on then saved ground while racing well back.

 nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn at the rail and finished well. TUITION PLAN was hustled to the lead nearing the three eighths pole, dueled

 Footnotes
 BLACK STEEL broke sharply and rated a slim lead inside from the five eighths pole, came under pressure at the five sixteenths, contested the edge nearest
 the rail rounding the far turn, raced clear inside the eighth pole and held well under steady encouragement. I GOT A BROTHER stalked the pace two deep,
 challenged the winner nearing the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep rounding the far turn but dropped back inside the eighth
 pole and couldn't improve. PROVIDENCE R V F saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and
 showed little further. ASK ME NOT raced in the five path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
 the far turn near the rail and passed rivals. CHASE MY ACE showed little response through the backstretch. I'LL BUY THAT raced in the three path the
 opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole then faded through the far turn. ITSAHATTATACK was outrun racing well off the pace. CRYPTOSONDE
 was reluctant to load and never factored. KATYS MIRACLE saved ground off the pace, showed no response to steady urging, broke his right hind leg
 nearing the quarter pole and had to be euthanized on the track. The stewards conducted an inquiry prior to declaring this race official.
