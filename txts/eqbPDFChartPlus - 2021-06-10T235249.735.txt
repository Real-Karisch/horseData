 Footnotes
 MUSICAL AMERICA angled inwards in the opening stages while being rated off the second flight to the backstretch, steadily gained position inside foes on
 the far turn, switched outside the leader to challenge for command nearing midstretch and gained a clear advantage under firm handling. MACKARONI ART
 settled last along the inside for five furlongs, saved ground to upper stretch and found his best late stride splitting foes just off the inside while proving only
 second best. STORMY SAILOR sped to the fore while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch, then gave way once
 headed by the winner. PLAYOFF BOUND, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter in early stages, lodged a brief bid between foes
 racing into the far turn but steadily faded in the drive. TIGER BY HIS TAIL, caught a bit wide early while prompted to a forward placing, was eased off the
 second flight to track outside foes, was urged to advance four wide nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. KENNEBAGO settled out of striking distance
 early and failed to menace. HARD TO PARK shifted outside foes early gaining a forward placing, tracked just off the pacesetter three wide to the far turn
 and soon emptied out.

 Footnotes
 HARKINS HALL was away alertly, rated well off the pace in the second flight, prompted at quarter pole, swung out four wide at the top of the lane and drove
 clear under steady right handed urging. POINTMAN tracked off the pace on the outside in the second flight to the half mile pole, shifted out advancing three
 wide on the far turn, took the lead at the top of the lane but was outkicked by HARKINS HALL in the final furlong and was second best. ABSTRACT
 PAYNTER was forwardly placed on the inside through the opening turn, attempted to shift out and split rivals nearing the seven sixteenths pole but lacked
 room, shifted back inside on the far turn, blocked at the three sixteenths pole, forced to alter course and came on late for show. R H SMOAKEM was caught
 three wide into the first turn, dropped back to settle in the same path along the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out nearing the eighth pole
 and came on belatedly in the center of the track. KILARNEY BLARNEY broke well away from the gate, tracked between foes through the first turn and along
 the backstretch, shifted out to bid three wide on the far turn and weakened in the lane. KAUN TE broke well from the gate, sprinted clear to open up on the
 field, set the pace along the backstretch and began to fade on the far turn. BERNINI broke slow, caught three wide on the first turn, moved forward to track
 the pace on the outside, and gave way past the three eighths pole. INSHALLAH was taken hold of shortly after the start, outrun, and walked off.

 STELLABRINI was rated between foes just off the second flight in the opening stages, angled to the inside after a half steadily gaining position inside foes.
 saved ground to upper stretch, shifted outside the pacesetter to challenge that foe leaving midstretch and wrested a clear advantage under firm handling.
 BELLA'S BACK, urged to the fore along the inside, disputed the pace inside a rival to the backstretch, went clear just before a half, dictated terms on a clear
 margin to midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. CAUSE TO WONDER, brushed at the start, was reserved between foes in the
 last flight while caught in tight quarters to the backstretch, was prompted to advance between rivals nearing upper stretch, exchanged several bumps with
 LASOEURCADETECHERI nearing upper stretch, briefly awaited an opening racing into upper stretch, then split rivals three deep in the final stages to
 prevail for a share while moving to close the gap on the top pair. RACINROSEMARY, off a bit awkwardly, was settled outside foes in the last flight to the far
 turn, swung out five wide nearing upper stretch and continued to make some mild progress to the end. LASOEURCADETECHERI tracked the leaders inside
 foes in second flight, continued under patient handling to the far turn, was prompted to advance along the rail on the far turn, exchanged bumps with
 CAUSE TO WONDER nearing upper stretch and had no late response. TACTICAL GIRL angled inwards early to track the leaders between foes in second
 flight to the far turn but steadily faded nearing upper stretch. JEANA BABY, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, was eased off
 that rival to track the pace to the second bend but steadily faded between foes nearing the lane. YANKEE PRIDE, restless in the gate, hopped at the start,
 was righted to track outside foes in second flight, lodged a brief, three wide bid between foes on the far turn but soon emptied out.

 ARCHARCHMONARCH tracked just outside the first flight in the opening stages, advanced four wide racing into the turn making sharp progress to
 challenge for command nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards while gaining a narrow advantage entering the lane, was briskly roused left handed making
 light contact with WAJNA SURPRISE in late stages but gamely held that foe under pressure. The latter was settled between foes in early stages, shifted out
 four wide nearing upper stretch gaining on the leaders, loomed outside the winner late, was lightly bumped and was just outfinished. JOHNNY THE JET,
 prominent outside foes in early stages, pressed the issue three wide between foes into the turn and weakened nearing midstretch. SAMURAI MIKE, off a bit
 slowly, was urged to make brief progress between foes but soon emptied out on the turn. R POINT MADE, urged inside foes disputing the pace, gave way
 early. AIN'TSEENTHEBALL vied for command between foes into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. COLFEAR was outpaced early while racing
 wide throughout. BEERMASTER flashed brief pace between foes but soon emptied out.

 WATERTONIAN, prominent outside foes from the outset, bid for commend three deep nearing upper stretch, went clear leaving midstretch and held the late
 challenge of CINCO STAR under firm handling. The latter tracked off the first flight between rivals under light rating racing to the turn, was prompted to
 advance nearing upper stretch, lugged inwards a bit entering the lane but switched outside the winner late to challenge that foe nearing the wire while
 proving only second best. HATTIES JEWEL, urged inside foes prompting a rival's pace, dueled for command into the lane and gave way late. VOW OF
 FRANCIS broke readily, forced the pace between foes racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. JUSTCALLME CHARLIE, off last, passed only
 tiring rivals. WARRIOR BOSS settled off the second flight early and failed to menace. PROXIMA tracked the leaders four wide, then three wide in second
 flight racing into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. AZARUK was a brief factor inside rivals in the second flight but retreated early.

 Footnotes
 DRAMA IN DANUBE was hustled to the lead out of the gate, prompted under strong right handed urging past the quarter pole and drew off in the lane under
 continued pressure. NORTHERNBRILLIANCE was alertly from the gate, dropped back to midpack, tracked three wide along the backstretch, bid briefly on
 the far turn but was no match and ran evenly in the lane. DERBYS MONEYMAKER tracked the pace on the inside along the backstretch, saved ground on
 the turn, and was evenly paced in the lane. SWEET SPRING was reserved outside to the half mile pole, began to advance four wide on the far turn, and
 flattened out in the stretch. RAJA'S APPEAL broke well, pressed the pace on the outside moving into the far turn, failed to match strides with the pacesetter
 and weakened in the lane. SERYY was allowed to settle on the inside in the early going, asked for run entering the far turn and failed to menace.
 ABSOLUTELY HOLY was erratic after the break swerving in and out, traveled near the rear of the field throughout and proved no factor. DEPUTY FLASH
 was far back throughout and proved no factor.

 Footnotes
 CREATIVE ART broke readily to gain the advantage along the inside in the opening sixteenth, conceded the lead in the opening quarter to track a rival from
 just out of striking distance racing into the turn, switched off the inside to bid for command between foes racing into upper stretch, gained the advantage and
 shifted out nearing the wire while gamely holding the challenge of MALIBU MAX to the end under firm handling. The latter tracked off the second flight inside
 foes early, shifted out nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance between foes, drifted out making repeated contact with SUPER TOUCH leaving
 midstretch but continued with interest while just outkicked by the winner. BOURBON COWBOY broke inwards bumping MALIBU PRO, bumped at the start,
 quickly sprinted clear of the field while his rider attempted to collect his mount despite broken reins, held sway to upper stretch but proved empty in the drive
 while just lasting for a share. MALIBU PRO tracked the pace outside foes to the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued with interest
 while just outkicked for a share. SUPER TOUCH tracked off the leader outside a rival in the opening stages, was urged to advance three wide into the lane,
 then was bumped and forced out in late stages. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF SUPER TOUCH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
 RIDER OF MALIBU MAX WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

 Footnotes
 NORTH OF EDEN was rated along the rail tracking just off the leaders into the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, awaited an opening racing into
 upper stretch, then switched out to split foes and wrest a narrow advantage in time under brisk right handed pressure. MOONLIGHT TRAIN, bumped at the
 start, switched outside foes racing four deep into the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to challenge three deep nearing upper stretch and proved best
 of the others. MERRI MESA, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, took over racing into the far turn, dictated the
 pace to upper stretch near the inside but faltered late. SOARING NOW, reluctant to load, broke outwards bumping MOONLIGHT TRAIN, then came through
 tight quarters exchanging some contact with SEYNATAWNEE racing into the first turn to gain a position just off the leaders, was prompted to bid between
 foes nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out. SEYNATAWNEE, caught in tight quarters while being bumped, then forced to check off rivals racing into
 the first turn, settled near the inside to the backstretch and never gained contention. SPICY SUPRISE was hustled to the lead from the outset while angling
 over sharply racing into the first turn, set the pace for a half and gave way abruptly racing into the far turn.
