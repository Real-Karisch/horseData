 Footnotes
 JOHNNY RITT vied for the advantage outside, edged clear on the turn and remained safe under steady urging. IRISH PAUL blocked through much of the
 turn, angled wide into the lane and rallied. BRILLIANT CHASE dropped back at the start, made a four wide middle move on the turn, loomed a threat and
 continued willingly. CANTSTOPRUNNING settled just off the leaders outside, bid closer on the turn then flattened out. TALENTED SON raced inside,
 awiated room on the turn but weakened when clear. RONIN WARRIOR lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. JAYJAYDEE hustled to the front inside,
 vied to the stretch and gave way. HIBACHI dropped back early and was never in contention.

 CLOONTIA set the pace inside, fought back gamely after relinquishing the lead deep stretch and got the nod. TRILOGY, in the three path and well placed,
 rallied outside winner into stretch, took the lead but just failed to last. SECRET SECRET, racing in the four path while just off the pace, had no late gain.
 YEAR OF THE KITTEN saved ground early, eased out and split rivals on the final turn and failed to sustain his bid. COUNTY CORRECTIONS angled to the
 rail after the start, split foes on the far turn and lacked a rally. MIND MAGIC steadied after start then failed to menace. CHARMING INDY also steadied
 leaving the gate then never reached contention. SHOELESS raced wide and failed to menace. BACKSTRETCH GEORGE stalked the early pace two wide
 then stopped. FRACTIONAL TIMES WERE NOT AVAILABLE.

 Footnotes
 WATCH MY DUST settled far behind, advanced inside, angled out on the final turn, offered a late surge and drew away. ALAAPATIQUE rated outside the
 pacesetters, bid on the final turn and finished willingly. KLAATU pursued the loose pacesetter outside and continued gamely to the finish. DUNK A DIN
 dropped far behind then passed fading rivals. AMERICAN ROMA stalked the leader three wide, advanced on the final turn but came up empty in the stretch.
 EMOTICON lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention. DON CAMILLO hustled to a clear lead for five furlongs then stopped abruptly. YOU'RE
 NO SAINT saved ground early and was finished after half a mile.

 Footnotes
 TRUE WISDOM saved ground early, swung out very wide near stretch, quickly took command leaving the furlong grounds and won under mild handling.
 FLATEXCEL set the pace in the four path but then was no match for winner. TU EXAGERES, outrun early, was very wide on the turn and into stretch and
 gained the show spot. MANTLE, two wide in second flight, tired. PREP PRIDE stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near mid stretch and then faded.
 TEW WAYS was never a threat. PURE STYLE saved ground in second flight then tired. PELLAGRINO steadied after the start, angled out and was no
 factor. INCIDENTALLY, very wide and just off the pace, tired. FAIRLY BOLD broke slowly then failed to menace.
