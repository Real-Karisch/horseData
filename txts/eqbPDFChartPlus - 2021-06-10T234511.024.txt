 HONOR UP through fairly heavy snow, chased two to three wide, tipped out four wide and advanced to issue a challenge continuing four wide into upper
 stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths, went clear under a light drive and was geared down through the final sixteenth. CARMINE'S HONOR
 chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths knocking heads with MAGNETRON, continued three wide into upper stretch, got displaced at the
 three-sixteenths and weakened while along for the place honors. MAGNETRON showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under urging at the
 three-eighths under challenge from the aforementioned foe to the outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch headed for command, weakened and
 was along for the show honors. SICILIA SAL two to three wide at the rear of the field, came under coaxing half a mile from home, continued two to three
 wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. HONOR MISSION forwardly placed in the two path early on, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came
 under coaxing half a mile from home, went four wide into upper stretch and tired. IMAGINAR chased inside, advanced mildly to briefly vie midway down the
 backstretch, got coaxed along fading three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and faltered. IRON JOHNNY chased four then three wide

 Footnotes
 BRIANBAKESCOOKIES chased along the inside coming under coaxing midway on the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
 nearing the eighth pole, came under a near sided stick drifting out nearing the sixteenth marker herding his main danger slightly, dug in and held on to
 prevail. ACOUSTIC four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through
 the final furlong, had BRIANBAKESCOOKIES drift out nearing the sixteenth marker and was slightly herded shying from that rival with no contact made,
 loomed through to the finish latched on but hung and was ultimately repelled. BARATTI chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled eight
 wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. LONE TRADER chased four then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into
 upper stretch seizing brief and narrow command, got displaced nearing the eighth pole, weakened in the final eighth. SON OF OAHU chased three wide in
 aim of the front, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. MANIFEST DESTINY showed the way from the
 two path until tucked inside put to coaxing half a mile from home, was under challenge through the latter portion of the turn, got headed spinning just off the
 inside for home, faltered in the stretch. ZIGARCH chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path half a mile out, came under coaxing with three
 furlongs to go, swung four wide for home and made no impact. SPARTY BOY showed brief speed three wide, began to fade, got out five wide through the
 turn, went six wide for home and was eased through the stretch. There was a Trainer's objection by the trainer of ACOUSTIC alleging interference against
 BRIANBAKESCOOKIES in the stretch run as well as a Stewards' Inquiry which was dismissed prior to the result standing and the race being declared
 official.

 CAOIMHE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out five wide a furlong out, rallied to
 engage the top pair inside the final sixteenth and just got up in the last jumps to prevail. BLUE EYES six wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing
 four wide midway on the turn, went six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat between foes late and was nailed
 at the finish. VIP NATION four wide in pursuit, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung four wide into
 upper stretch, darted inside nearing the eighth pole forcing TIZ ANNA RAE to steady on the rail and fought on inside to secure the show honors. DESERT

 late stages. STATUS ASTHMATICUS pressed the pace four then three wide, came under coaxing just off the inside midway on the turn, took over
 command at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, got headed nearing the eighth pole and weakened through to the finish. CARIBBEAN

 wide through the turn, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch, tired. SPEEDY ANALYSIS broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, raced
 seven wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn and made no impact. TIZ ANNA RAE cut the pace three then two wide under
 pressure from STATUS ASTHMATICUS to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got headed five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the
 inside into upper stretch, steadied as VIP NATION darted in front nearing the eighth pole, then faltered in the drive. GIRLIE'S DREAM chased along the

 QUEZON chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, closed well to get up in the final jumps
 and prevail. PICCO UNO four to five wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, dug in and took over
 command nearing the eighth pole, came under growing threat to the outside and was caught in the final strides. ABSATOOTLY showed the way in hand
 three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in and was headed a furlong out, weakened in the late stages.
 KALABAKA four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. FUSAICHI RED chased
 five wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide for home, took a bad step in the vicinity of the eighth pole, was immediately protected
 and eased up but tragically had to be euthanized on track.
