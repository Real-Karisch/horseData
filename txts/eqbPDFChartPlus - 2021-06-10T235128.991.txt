 Footnotes
 GOLD MAN disputed the pace two to three wide outside TIPSY MOOSE, overtook that one leaving the three sixteenths, shook clear under strong handling
 inside the furlong grounds and held firm. SPIRIT GRABBER angled in and settled off the leaders nearing the half mile pole, swung out four wide
 approaching the stretch and closed steadily on his left lead. TIPSY MOOSE rushed up early and vied inside the winner, gained a short lead around the turn,
 ceded command near the three sixteenths and weakened late. HENNESSY FIRE broke slowly, hustled up soon after then checked when shying from an
 object in the opening sixteenths, dropped far back after that issue, was under pressure around the turn, angled wide and closed well in a nice recovery.
 BESSIE'S BOY chased the dueling leaders three wide and weakened. Due to an obstructed view, the quarter mile call was made approximately a sixteenth
 of a mile early.

 in approaching the first turn, set the pace along the rail and weakened late. LIKEAGIRL saved ground in a willing effort. LA LA BAMBA , well back for six
 furlongs, raced inside horses in the stretch and had a mild rally. SPICY GIRL RED lacked speed and was never a factor. ON THE HOP chased the pace off

 Footnotes
 SOMETHINGWITHLILLY vied three deep, appeared to have her heels clipped near the five eighths, dropped back a bit leaving the five sixteenths, swung
 out four wide entering the lane, came back under a steady drive and wore down ESTRELLA GRANDE in the final strides. ESTRELLA GRANDE , four wide
 in close attendance, moved to entertain the leaders near the half mile pole, dropped in a bit while dueling into the lane, shook clear with a furlong remaining
 but failed to contain the winner. IAM A DANCER disputed the pace along the rail for seven and a half furlongs and weakened late. PAULINE'S RAVEN was
 steadied back from between rivals soon after the break, was well off the pace and under the whip leaving the five eighths, angled wide and offered a mild
 kick. NANCY R edged up into a tight spot three wide and between foes nearing the five eighths pole, clipped heels and nearly lost her rider, regrouped,
 angled out and failed to recover. DONNA'S DELIGHT was steadied along nearing the backstretch, angled out and pulled her way two wide between foes
 nearing the five eighths, dueled a short lead past the five sixteenths, stayed on to mid stretch then succumbed. ALYDARIUS steadied early and faltered.
 There was a stewards' inquiry into the incident involving NANCY R. No action was taken. The quarter mile call was called early due to obstructions.

 COLONEL ARGO settled off the pace and raced two wide past the three eighths, swung out past the five sixteenths, closed determinedly under stout left
 handed encouragement, forged ahead of CATAPULT JACK in deep stretch and edged clear at the line. CATAPULT JACK stalked the pace three wide,
 closed in under a drive and put a head in front in mid stretch, edged away slightly nearing the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. VALADIER broke
 slowly then ducked in towards the gap, regrouped and settled off the pace, saved ground mid turn, swung out nearing mid stretch and rallied. LUNAR
 BOOGIE prompted the pace two wide, took closer order after a half mile, gained the lead in upper stretch, failed to withstand a rival in mid stretch and
 weakened. FLANKENSTEIN stumbled at the break, was urged along inside and faded. IN YOUR POCKET sprinted to the front, set the pace towards the
 rail, went clear around the turn, took pressure soon past the quarter pole and faltered through the final furlong.

 EMOTICON , between rivals nearing the three quarter pole, secured the rail leaving the far turn and was under the whip mid way on the final turn, eased out
 soon into the stretch, closed relentlessly under repeated left handed encouragement and wore down HATTERAS BOUND in the final yards. HATTERAS
 BOUND set a pressured pace inside while under rating, shook clear around the final turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, maintained a clear advantage
 past the furlong grounds, dug in when confronted leaving the sixteenths pole and gave way grudgingly. GAETANO , three deep stalking the pace, was
 under a drive past the five sixteenths, shifted in and earned the show. AFLEET DOMINATION forced the issue outside HATTERAS BOUND, failed to match
 strides mid way on the final turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, was corrected with right handed rousing and faded. BOB'S MY UNCLE saved ground,
 steadied leaving the far turn, swung five wide and came up empty. The quarter mile call was called about sixty yards early due to an obstructed view
