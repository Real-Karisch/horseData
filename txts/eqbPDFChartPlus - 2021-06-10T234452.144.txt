 Footnotes
 BRITE CRISTIAN was always well placed, raced two wide on the second turn, pushed up to engage the leader to mid stretch then dug in determinedly to
 prevail. BOBBY MAGIC set the pace to the second turn, responded saving ground to the stretch, was collared by the winner a furlong out then battled to
 save the place. MAGIK PEPPER eased in soon after the start to save ground but was caught in tight behind BOBBY MAGIC and raced in check to the five
 eighths, remained behind that one to the second turn, was boxed inside to the stretch then angled out for room, responded when clear but could not make
 an impact. SUNNY DEE had no speed, trailed to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch, was fanned out widest for the drive then drifted in while
 slightly erratic, got pulled back out in mid stretch and just missed third. FORBID had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid three wide then eased down to
 the two path into the stretch but could not muster the needed late response. TAILORED was chasing to the half, raced three wide to the stretch but
 weakened in the drive. TAKEAGOODLOOK settled mid pack, raced four wide throughout and gave way after six furlongs.

 TWICE AS FAST broke alertly, went right to the front, set the pace while off the rail to the stretch then responded to kick away to mid stretch and held
 driving. LUCKY LUCCIANA chased the pace from the rail to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch but battled late to get the place. THIS'S HOW WE
 ROLL pressed the winner three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then lost second late. THATABOYROY tracked the winner two then three
 wide to the stretch but failed to offer a late response. PEPPER MAGIC broke a bit slow and was never a factor. ROYAL CHARTER was always outrun.

 LORD nearing the sixteenth marker and edged clear driving. SAXON LORD pressed the pace to the second turn, dueled two wide to the stretch, inched
 away under urging to mid stretch then could not stall the winner while not threatened for second. SHADES OF VICTORY chased the pace to the second
 turn, was asked for speed three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. UNDENIABLE U also chased the leader for a half mile, saved
 ground to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. MELVILLE set the pace under pressure for five furlongs, was overtaken and passed in upper stretch
 then tired.

 determinedly. AMERICAN ARISTOCAT stalked the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide and dueled to mid stretch, was collared by the winner leaving
 the furlong grounds but dug in late to hold second. ROYAL BANKER (GB) had no speed, trailed to the second turn, raced three wide then swung out widest
 for the drive and closed willingly but too late. DYNAMIC SCORING attended the pace outside of NEPTUNE'S SPEAR, was two wide to the stretch then was
 outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. NEPTUNE'S SPEAR had good speed, dueled from the rail for six furlongs, was passed in mid stretch and
 weakened. SMALL TOWN COP was chasing to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. SIBERIAN LAUGHTER also chased the pace to the second
 turn, was two wide to the stretch but went wrong in mid stretch, was pulled up and vanned off.
